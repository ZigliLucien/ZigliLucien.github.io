Technically, Samsung never left, as the Galaxy Chromebook 2 360 was released in 2022, with the Galaxy Chromebook Go and Chromebook 2 landing in 2021.</p><p>Since then, we&apos;ve seen HP dabble in high-end Chromebooks, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review">Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition</a> was released, all while Acer, ASUS, and Lenovo kept chugging along. We can finally reset the timeline as the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is here, but has Samsung done enough to disrupt the status quo?</p>

<p>Following its announcement in September 2024, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus was officially released on October 4, 2024. Currently, there is only one configuration to choose from, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, with a starting price of $699. You can purchase the Galaxy Chromebook Plus from a variety of retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, or Samsung, among others.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-what-i-like"><span>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-14.jpg" alt="Empty desktop on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Out of the gate, my absolute favorite "thing" about Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Chromebook Plus is how incredibly thin and lightweight it is. When I attended Google&apos;s Fall Chromebook Showcase, I saw quite a few employees just walking around and carrying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-2024samsung-lenovo-chromebooks-hands-on">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, and now I understand why.</p><p>I&apos;ve found myself doing practically the same thing, even when just going between rooms in my house. For a bit of perspective, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is thinner than the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> with the Keyboard Cover attached. Remove the cover, and the Tab S10 Ultra wins out here, but not by much.</p><p>All the while housing a gorgeous 15.6-inch AMOLED screen that looks as good as you&apos;d expect from a Samsung display. It&apos;s just an incredible combination that really makes other Chromebooks at this price point look quite outdated. The only real exceptions that I can think of are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-elite-dragonfly-chromebook-review">HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review">Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</a>.</p>

<p>With a design that&apos;s so thin, I figured port selection would be at a premium. Surprisingly (and thankfully,) that&apos;s not the case, as we have dual USB-C ports, one USB-A port, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot, a 3.5mm audio combo jack, and even a full-size HDMI port. Again, all of this in a package that&apos;s slimmer than the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-22.jpg" alt="Comparing the thickness between the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else I assumed was that this would be the first Chromebook to rely on one of Qualcomm&apos;s fancy new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-new-wave-of-chromebooks">Snapdragon X Elite chips</a>. However, that&apos;s not the case, as the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is powered by the Intel Core 3 100U processor, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>Seeing as this was the first Chromebook that I&apos;ve used powered by Intel&apos;s Raptor Lake series, I was curious about performance. I ran the Galaxy Chromebook Plus through a gauntlet of tests, comparing it to the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714, which utilizes the Intel Core Ultra 5 115U.</p>

<p>What does that mean for everyone else? Superb performance out of the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. Not only is this sleek and svelte, but it&apos;s also incredibly powerful, making for almost the perfect combination.</p><p>Getting everything from Steam and Linux has been a breeze, which is important as there are some Linux apps that I prefer over their Android counterparts on Chromebooks. Don&apos;t go into this thinking that you&apos;ll be able to play Cyberpunk 2077 at Ultra settings, but you will have a tough time pushing the Galaxy Chromebook Plus to its limits.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-26.jpg" alt="Black Myth Wukong via NVIDIA GeForce Now on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance and design are only two parts of the game, as a Chromebook can be incredibly powerful, only to have the experience ruined by a less-than-stellar typing experience. Thankfully, that hasn&apos;t been much of an issue for me, as I quite enjoy the scissor-like keys of the Galaxy Chromebook Plus.</p><p>Admittedly, having a numpad has taken a bit of getting used to, as I&apos;m accustomed to 13-inch or 14-inch devices that don&apos;t have space for such a thing. But that&apos;s definitely subjective, as it&apos;s still a bit odd for my hands to not be typing or resting in the middle of the keyboard.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-quick-insert-key-and-ai"><span>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: Quick Insert Key and AI</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-6.jpg" alt="Close up on keyboard and left ports on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This brings us to another one of the "stars of the show" as the new Quick Insert Key makes its debut on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. It&apos;s supposed to make life easier by offering different ways to interact with things that reside across Google&apos;s various services.</p><p>On paper, it sounds like a wonderful idea, and it&apos;s definitely come in handy a couple of times. However, there are some growing pains, especially for someone who doesn&apos;t solely rely on Google services.</p><p>For example, most of my writing is done in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/obsidian-best-note-taking-app-youve-never-heard">Obsidian</a>, and not Google Docs, as it&apos;s been my preferred app for years. Although the Google Play Store app and the Linux app are almost identical, I&apos;ve dealt with some quirks when using the former in the past. So <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">getting Linux set up</a> and installing Obsidian is one of the first things I do when a new Chromebook arrives.</p><p>Unfortunately, while the Quick Insert window appears, it doesn&apos;t actually let me insert anything into the Linux version. I guess it shouldn&apos;t come as too much of a surprise, but Quick Insert works just fine with the Play Store version of the app, which has left me to decide which version to rely on moving forward.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7toEJcBHissLb7zzLyXyUg" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-18.jpg" alt="Help me write in Google Docs on Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7toEJcBHissLb7zzLyXyUg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving past my very niche example, I can definitely see and appreciate the utility of what the Quick Insert key brings to the table. My only catch is that I wish there were more integrations or extensions at my disposal. I&apos;d love to hit the Quick Insert key and start chatting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, use it to set a reminder, or even just perform a basic Google search. For now, those aren&apos;t possible, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s outside the realm of possibility.</p><p>On the other hand, Help Me Read is quickly turning into one of the things that I miss whenever I use my desktop Windows machine or MacBook Pro. It&apos;s extremely handy when there&apos;s something I want to read, but I don&apos;t have the time to do so.</p><p>So I let Gemini do the heavy lifting for me, as it summarizes even long reviews into just a few sentences. What comes in handy even more is that I&apos;m able to ask it follow-up questions. For instance, Android Central Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, recently published the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4 review</a>. I had a specific question about whether he recommends it for someone who hasn&apos;t used a smart ring before, so I just asked, and Gemini spit out an answer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="prhj8uUAxFPyEwTvZJbMi4" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-17.jpg" alt="Help me read on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/prhj8uUAxFPyEwTvZJbMi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My favorite thing about Help Me Read is actually that the drop-down window doesn&apos;t disappear when I click away from the page that it was activated. Instead, you can basically just use your Chromebook and leave the window open. When you want something else summarized, just hover the mouse cursor near the top of the window and click the bar to refresh it, being provided with a new summarization.</p><p>I think this is a huge leap in the right direction for not just Chromebooks but also Gemini and AI on ChromeOS. Now, I just have to keep my fingers crossed that Google continues to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assisant-actions-to-replace-gemini-extensions-on-android">more integrations</a> with future updates.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eGYGwYUpdo2kuMtXv2G8Lk" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-15.jpg" alt="Close up of the trackpad on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGYGwYUpdo2kuMtXv2G8Lk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve spent a lot of time raving about the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, which isn&apos;t a difficult thing to do when a device provides such enjoyment. However, it&apos;s not quite the <em>perfect</em> Chromebook out there, as there are things that have brought me back down to Earth a bit.</p><p>So far, my biggest annoyance has been the trackpad. It&apos;s almost <em>always</em> the trackpad that sours things for me. On the bright side, it&apos;s enormous, which doesn&apos;t come as a surprise given the size of the keyboard deck. On the downside, it&apos;s a mechanical or "traditional" trackpad, which is <em>fine</em>.</p><p>The problem that I&apos;ve been dealing with the most here is the "click-and-drag" gesture. It just plainly sucks, and I really wish companies would switch to haptic trackpads. I understand that it would increase the price, or in this case, make the Galaxy Chromebook Plus thicker, but it&apos;s a trade-off worth making.</p><p>I was also surprised to see that while Samsung went through the trouble to include a total of six ports, but didn&apos;t include a fingerprint scanner. There&apos;s also no privacy switch for the selfie camera, but that&apos;s less of a surprise given how thin the top lid is. Still, I would have liked to have some type of biometric unlock onboard, even if the hardware privacy switch wasn&apos;t possible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JdZZYTbo6pmsitqpWW4m63" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-16.jpg" alt="Running out of memory on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JdZZYTbo6pmsitqpWW4m63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing that&apos;s clear about the Galaxy Chromebook Plus it&apos;s that Samsung and Google worked to make one of the most elegant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> without being too expensive. As such, there&apos;s currently only one configuration to choose from, maxing out with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>My gripes about limited storage are mostly squelched with the inclusion of the microSD card slot, but the same can&apos;t be said about RAM. It&apos;s only happened a couple of times, but I have run into tabs crashing. I&apos;ve also had things slow to a crawl, only to open the Diagnostics app and see that basically all of my memory has been accounted for.</p><p>I also understand that I&apos;m probably a fringe case, as not very many people will set up and use Linux apps or have 50 tabs open across multiple virtual desktops. So perhaps this is one of those "deal with it" scenarios, but I sure wish Samsung even offered a 16GB/256GB model.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It might just be me, but I'd really like to see Samsung release a model with 16GB of RAM.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Last but not least, I have no idea how Samsung managed to get "up to 13 hours" of battery life out of the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. On my best day, I&apos;ve been able to get <em>maybe</em> six hours before Battery Saver kicked on. Most of the time, I&apos;m seeing between four and five hours on a single charge.</p><p>It&apos;s not the end of the world, but it&apos;s something to keep in mind if the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is on your radar. I&apos;m hoping things will improve, but I&apos;m also not going to be holding my breath.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-the-competition"><span>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3831px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vJhA5c6xDeY9oirLb6UHyh" name="asus-expertbook-cx54-chromebook-plus-hands-on-3.jpg" alt="ASUS ExpertBook CX54 Chromebook Plus hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJhA5c6xDeY9oirLb6UHyh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3831" height="2155" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Richard Devine / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the price point, there isn&apos;t too much in the way of competition for the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. Without a doubt, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-features-rolling-out">Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714</a> is always at the top of the list, for a few reasons. The first of which is the convertible design, complete with a touchscreen display, while offering great battery life and power. Although it retails for $699, it&apos;s regularly on sale for less, as we&apos;ve seen it go for as low as $120 off.</p><p>Next up, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/asus-expertbook-cx54-chromebook-plus-first-look">ASUS Expertbook CX54 Chromebook Plus</a>, which was announced at CES 2024, but didn&apos;t actually show up until early July. This is arguably the most premium Chromebook that ASUS has ever released, offering excellent build quality, and a beautiful 14-inch QHD display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate. It&apos;s equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 5 SoC, and Samsung&apos;s offering, is paired with 8GB of RAM. However, you&apos;ll only be able to get 128GB of storage with this one.</p><p>Rounding out the pack is HP&apos;s Chromebook Plus x360 14-inch. This has replaced the now-retired Dragonfly Chromebook Pro and Dragonfly Elite Chromebook at the top of HP&apos;s lineup. It&apos;s a little less expensive than the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, retailing at $629, and offers a convertible design. The biggest downside here is that it&apos;s reliant on the Core i3-N305, which is at the lower end of Intel&apos;s last-gen Alder Lake series.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the thinnest and lightest Chromebook.</li><li>You need plenty of power, regardless of battery life.</li><li>You want the dedicated Quick Insert key.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget.</li><li>You need a Chromebook with the best battery life.</li><li>You want a convertible design.</li><li>You need a touchscreen.</li></ul>
<p>It&apos;s become pretty apparent that Google&apos;s vision for high-end Chromebooks has changed a bit. Instead of trying to pack as many hardware features into a single device as it thinks an OEM can, the reality is that $1,000+ Chromebooks just aren&apos;t as appealing as some might hope. Instead, I feel as though the Galaxy Chromebook Plus kind of represents a "changing of the guard" for the platform.</p><p>For all of the grief that I give Samsung, there are times when it releases a product that I just thoroughly enjoy from top to bottom. That&apos;s where the Galaxy Chromebook Plus falls, for me, despite lacking things like a touchscreen or multi-day battery life. What it does do, is set a new standard for what we should expect from new Chromebook Plus models released at this price point.</p><p>I plan to keep using this for as long as I can, hoping it will age like a fine wine. However, I&apos;m also hopeful that this might spark a bit more competition at the high end of the market, giving everyone even more options. It might even be enough to help push others to improve and push the envelope, instead of recycling the same design every year.</p>

<p>For a while, it seemed like smartphones were just going to get bigger and bigger until we were all basically walking around with tablets, but now there are quite a few great options if you&apos;re in the market for a small phone. If you&apos;ve got petite hands like me and prefer smaller phones, you&apos;ll find all of the best compact smartphones below.</p><p>We&apos;ve personally tested every one of these phones ourselves and can give you the good (and bad) parts of each device on this list. Ultimately, I chose the Samsung Galaxy S24 as the best small phone for most people. This is because the S24 has one of the fastest processors you can get with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, fabulous cameras, and an excellent update policy that will keep your phone up-to-date for years to come.</p>

<p>While the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> steals much of the spotlight for Samsung&apos;s latest S24 generation of phones, the base Galaxy S24 is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> with most of the bigger phone&apos;s best features. The Galaxy S24 looks an awful lot like the outgoing S23, but when it comes to being a small phone, it&apos;s made a few nice upgrades. First, the screen is slightly larger at 6.2 inches with no more than a millimeter in additional width. In fact, the phone is ever so slightly shorter than the previous model.</p><p>Another upgrade comes with the battery which gets a shot in the arm to take it from 3,900mAh to 4,000mAh with support for 25W wired charging and 15W wireless charging. The camera system is led by the tried and true 50MP sensor with a 10MP telephoto and 12MP ultrawide camera helping out. Be careful buying an international model as some are fitted with the Exynos 2400 SoC which is a solid chip, but not as capable as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 fitted to the US model.</p><p>When it comes to carrier support, just about every carrier will activate the S24 without issue. Support for 5G on the major carriers including Verizon and AT&T&apos;s mid-band 5G is present with mmWave on the US model. Finally, Samsung is offering an impressive seven years of software updates for the S24 phones so you know your phone will be up-to-date for years to come. I am certain that there&apos;s no other small phone today that is this powerful and sleek.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s Pixel A-series has long been a value leader since the series was introduced. While most A-series phones have been on the smaller side, they often pair the diminutive size and price with equally diminutive specs. Like the 7a, however, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> can be considered a "value flagship" phone that also doubles as the best small phone you can buy.</p><p>Every time I pick the phone up and use it, I marvel at how this phone only costs $500 and yet feels so darn premium in every way. The processor inside is the same one in the more expensive Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, offering the same advanced camera features as those Pixel phones. It&apos;s also extremely comfortable to hold, with Google rounding the edges and tweaking the overall design with the 8 range. I had a tough time of it, choosing between the 8 and the 8a, but the 8a just gives so much more value for money.</p><p>In addition to the Pixel 8a hosting the joint best camera hardware on any A-series model to date alongside the previous model, the Tensor G3 processor also ensures that the photos you capture are crystal clear every time. Google has long been a master at this with features like Face Unblur technology, automatically capturing crisp faces even when there&apos;s movement.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s any one specific reason to get a foldable phone, it&apos;s to fit a bigger display in an actual pocketable form factor. That&apos;s precisely why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is the best foldable phone for fans of smaller phones. Case in point, it might have a giant 6.7-inch display on the inside — which is anything but "small" or pocketable — but the Flip 6 folds <em>in half </em>when you&apos;re done with it, giving you the convenience of a small phone size and a big screen when you need it. I don&apos;t know about you, but I&apos;m a nineties kid so the nostalgia factor of flip phones is also a big draw for me.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung also boosted the size of the battery, so you can expect longer battery life per charge compared to the Flip 5. The Z Flip 6 is a hair thinner when folded, but otherwise is roughly the same size as the previous model. The new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor makes everything about the phone better, including the camera experience.</p><p>Samsung has finally given the Flip 6 an official protection against solid particles, thanks to the IP48 rating. Once again, Samsung has continued to choose refinement over dramatic transformation; choose this phone and you&apos;ll be getting one of the most enjoyable and unique small phone experiences around.</p>

<p>Most small Android phones can&apos;t be called small by the same definition we had just five years ago, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">ASUS Zenfone 10</a> eschews that thought and delivers a true one-handed experience. This tiny phone is so good that the succeeding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> pales in comparison — not to mention it&apos;s far too big. I won&apos;t lie, I was a sucker for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">Zenfone 9</a>. Part of me is still mad at ASUS for revamping the Zenfone 11. Don&apos;t fix what isn&apos;t broken!</p><p>Thus, I continue to recommend the spunky little Zenfone 11 for small phone lovers. Even the side-mounted fingerprint sensor can be used to scroll content on the screen, enabling new ways of one-handed use that aren&apos;t often seen.</p><p>In addition to that, ASUS packed a big, huge battery inside as well as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, which is still incredibly powerful by today&apos;s standards. That means you&apos;re going to get almost the best performance from an Android phone <em>and</em> battery life that&apos;ll make you wonder what sort of voodoo magic ASUS worked on the phone. Two-day battery life is normal with the Zenfone 10, and that&apos;s almost hard to believe when a phone is this fast.</p><p>ASUS also packed in some truly superb cameras, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack onboard, making us wonder why other OEMs can&apos;t get their act together and include one. The Zenfone 10 is available in the U.S. and works on both the AT&T and T-Mobile networks with support for 5G, though rural coverage may be weaker than Samsung and Google phones due to supporting fewer bands.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> might not seem particularly impressive over a Pixel 8 at first glance, but the changes to the design, the larger battery, and its new AI features kind of make up for the increase in price. The Pixel 9 is slimmer than the Pixel 8 and has similar dimensions as the 8a, but it is a bit heavier now at 198g. The fact that the Pixel 9 now gets a 6.3-inch display in a similarly-sized body as the 8a is a huge bonus.</p><p>Software is once again the highlight of the Pixel 9, thanks to novel and useful AI tools. The new Tensor G4 chipset allows the phone to run Gemini Nano with Multimodality for understanding text, images, and audio, and process results on-device. New GenAI tools allow you to add objects and visual elements to enhance existing images. The Pixel 9 is also guaranteed to get seven years of OS and security updates too, making it future-proof.</p><p>The ultrawide camera on the Pixel 9 finally got a boost in resolution, with a new 48MP sensor. Another area of improvement is the battery capacity, which has gone up to 4,700mAh. The Pixel 9 starts at $799, which is $100 more than what the Pixel 8 launched at.</p><p>Personally, I&apos;d splurge on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro over the Pixel 9</a> purely for the additional telephoto lens, more RAM, and better screen brightness, but that honestly doesn&apos;t justify the $200 price gap between the two. Not everyone can (or should) spend that kind of money on menial upgrades. So, if you want the best AI features on a small Android phone and a stunning design, I recommend the Google Pixel 9 for most people.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>The market for small Android phones isn&apos;t as expansive as it used to be, but there are still plenty of choices out there if you know where to look. When it comes to our performance, the Galaxy S24 is an easy choice with the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC powering it, and excellent software support from Samsung promising seven years of Android updates. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S23, the S24 has increased its screen size and battery size without making the phone noticeably wider.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a may not be what everyone considers "small" but it has amazing specs across the board, comes in at a price that&apos;s more than reasonable, and can still be considered small by modern phone standards. Using the Pixel 8a is pretty darn great no matter what you&apos;re doing, often punching above what you&apos;d expect from a phone this cheap. If you want a more premium experience in a similar form factor, the Pixel 9 checks all the boxes. It&apos;s better than the 8a in pretty much every way, but comes at a big bump in price.</p><p>If you need a phone that&apos;s truly designed for one-handed use, then look no further than the Zenfone 10. ASUS somehow managed to deliver high-end hardware, great cameras, and a large battery into this small phone, and it is a truly standout package that can&apos;t even be beaten by its own newer iteration. It would be a bit higher on the list with better support for U.S. carriers like Verizon, and more retailer availability.</p>

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>☑️ Over <strong>50 phones </strong>tested every year by our team</p></div></div>
<p>Testing phones at Android Central involves much more than simply booting up a device to ensure it works. We can use phones with a consumer mindset because <em>we</em> <em>are consumers, </em>in addition to Android enthusiasts and product testers. Unlike some sites that rely solely on benchmark programs and lab tests to verify performance, we use smartphones in real-life scenarios to better understand how a device will perform during normal, day-to-day use.</p><p>This involves personally hitting the streets to see how a phone&apos;s camera holds up during the day <em>and </em>night, and comparing pictures from two devices side by side to see how they differ. Our testing involves running multiple performance-heavy apps simultaneously to see if a phone will overheat or swiftly lose battery life. It involves booting up graphics-intensive games at the highest settings to see if the images will lag or stutter, and it means draining the battery of a phone to zero to test the speed at which it will recharge.</p><p>This barely scratches the surface of every testing metric we apply to each new device, so check out our guide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-we-test-and-review-phones-at-android-central">how Android Central tests and reviews phones</a> to learn more.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-where-did-you-buy-it-and-how"><span>Where did you buy it, and how?</span></h3>
<p>First and foremost, mobile carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon want to keep you paying monthly for their service. To do this, they offer discounts for those willing to stick around for a couple of years. It&apos;s not uncommon for a carrier to lock a phone until you pay it off to prevent you from taking advantage of a discount and switching carriers.</p><p>While your phone is locked, you won&apos;t be able to use service from another carrier. Luckily, getting your phone unlocked isn&apos;t too hard, and it may even unlock automatically if enough time has passed. Unlocking the phone might take longer than you&apos;d like, but it&apos;ll all be worth it when it is unlocked and accessible with another carrier.</p><p>If you bought your phone from a carrier, the first thing to do is make sure you pay it off. If you were paying it off with a series of payments, you&apos;d need to ensure you have paid the total balance. You haven&apos;t paid the phone off if you see a deduction offset by a bill credit for a phone purchase. Contact customer support for the information if you&apos;re unsure how much your remaining balance is.</p>

<p>Remember that some carriers use buy-one-get-one (BOGO) deals with monthly bill credits to lock customers into a cycle of paying off the phone for the entire term. If you&apos;ve participated in one of these promotions, you still have to pay for the phones, and switching to a new carrier could invalidate the bill credits that were bringing the phone price down.</p><p>Once you pay off the phone, it will either unlock automatically, or you can request an unlock from the carrier. If switching to a new carrier, unlock your phone before leaving your old carrier. You can still get your phone unlocked down the line, but it&apos;s easier to misplace the needed information, and the process could take longer.</p><p>If you bought your phone from Amazon or another online retailer, it would list it as unlocked or carrier-specific. Be sure to choose the unlocked version for your region. International models will more often than not work with U.S. carriers, but you may not have access to all carrier bands, and 5G support may be weaker than that of U.S. models.</p><p>When you buy a phone directly from a manufacturer such as Samsung, Asus, or OnePlus, it is undoubtedly unlocked and ready to use with your new carrier. When you buy the phone from an online retailer such as Amazon, ensure that you choose the unlocked version before heading out to checkout.</p><p>There&apos;s only one foolproof way to check for the rest of the phones: Try it.</p>

<p>You can also try those online services that claim to let you know if your phone is unlocked by providing them with the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-imei-number-your-phone">IMEI</a>. While that might be true, these services cost money and are often incorrect. I&apos;ll come right out and say it: <strong>Don&apos;t bother</strong>.</p><p>Instead, you can call your carrier or the carrier/MVNO you&apos;re considering switching. Companies keep a database of IMEI numbers indicating which phones are compatible, unlocked, or blocked. </p><p>You might not have any luck here, though, because the person answering the phone might not be able to give you that information—they either don&apos;t have access to it or aren&apos;t allowed to tell you over the phone. However, it&apos;s worth a try if you can&apos;t access a SIM card from a different company.</p><p>Skipping all that, the easiest way to find out if your phone is unlocked is just to put in a SIM card from another carrier. It doesn&apos;t have to be a SIM card connected to an active account — the phone will try to initiate a connection with any SIM card in place. If you don&apos;t want to buy one or your friend won&apos;t let you use theirs, you can also try one from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-free-trial">Mint Mobile&apos;s free trial offer</a> and get a SIM card. Some carriers like Google Fi will even send you a SIM for free when you sign up for a plan, and it doesn&apos;t charge you anything until you activate the card. </p><p>The process is as follows:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="kFACN5bmHy8gmnr78Ejea7" name="galaxy-s9-plus-sim-card-sd-card-slot.jpg" alt="Galaxy S9+ SIM card tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFACN5bmHy8gmnr78Ejea7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ol><li>If possible, make a phone call using your <strong>current</strong> SIM card to check that the phone is working properly. (Call your parents to say "hello"; they'll appreciate it.)<br></li><li>Shut off the phone and remove the SIM card. If you're not sure how to do this, look in the manual or online. If you need a SIM card removal tool, there's usually one stuck to the paperwork in your phone's box. A small paper clip may also work if you can't find the tool. You may also want to give it a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sim-pin-code-and-how-unlock-sim-card-pin" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sim-pin-code-and-how-unlock-sim-card-pin">SIM PIN code</a> first so no one can steal and use your old SIM card.<br></li><li>Put the <strong>new</strong> SIM card in your phone and power it back on.<br></li><li>If you're greeted with a dialog box telling you to enter a SIM unlock code, your phone is SIM-locked to the carrier from which it was initially purchased.<br></li><li>If you <strong>don't</strong> see an unlock code prompt, check that it says you have service if you used a valid SIM card. If you do, your phone is probably unlocked. Sometimes, the phone takes a few minutes to configure for a new network, so be patient. Try making another phone call. (Your parents won't mind two calls on the same day.)</li></ol>
<p>You&apos;ll probably get a recorded message with an error code if you can&apos;t call using the new SIM card. You can jot down the code and check online to see why you can&apos;t complete the call so you know if it&apos;s because of a SIM lock or incompatible hardware. A wholly incompatible phone with another network is unlikely nowadays, but it&apos;s worth checking.</p><p>If you don&apos;t have access to another SIM card, you can also take your phone to a carrier store and tell them you&apos;re thinking of switching carriers and want to check if it&apos;s unlocked. Don&apos;t feel bad about telling them you want to switch; they probably hear it constantly. They can help you insert the SIM card and check if the phone is unlocked.</p><p>If your phone <em>is</em> SIM-locked, don&apos;t fret. Carriers will SIM unlock your phone provided you&apos;ve paid the total amount and your account is in good standing. Each carrier has slightly different rules regarding how long you must own the phone and how long your account must be open.</p><p>You may request an unlock directly from your phone&apos;s settings. T-Mobile has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/devices/unlock-your-mobile-wireless-device/" target="_blank">a help page</a> dedicated to showing customers how to do this. If your phone doesn&apos;t have this option, you can also download the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmobile.grsuapp&hl=en_US" target="_blank">T-Mobile Device Unlocker app for Pixel</a> users. </p><p>AT&T also has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.deviceunlock" target="_blank">unlocker app</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/" target="_blank">a website to request unlocks</a>. Depending on your device, the unlocking process might take a little time, so be patient if it doesn&apos;t unlock immediately.</p><p>In many cases, you may need to do nothing at all. Verizon, for example, states that it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/device-unlocking-policy/">automatically unlock phones 60 days</a> after the purchase. If your Verizon phone hasn&apos;t been unlocked automatically after 60 days, you may need to call customer service to have them submit the unlock request.</p><p>If all that doesn&apos;t work, you can call customer service, and they&apos;ll help you. If you&apos;ve paid the phone off and it hasn&apos;t, no one reports it lost or stolen; you should have no trouble getting it unlocked.</p>

<p>Most smartphone owners ask how to check if their phone is unlocked because they plan to switch carriers. You&apos;ve probably seen some ads for prepaid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a> offering cheaper service than the Big Three. And since they use the same networks as the Big Three, they&apos;ll usually work with just about any unlocked phone.</p><p>We think that&apos;s great because having even more choices isn&apos;t bad. Even if you go with one of the prominent carriers, having the ability to switch <em>whenever</em> you want to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">best cell phone plans</a> puts the power in <em>your</em> hands.</p><p>But no matter which carrier you choose, you&apos;ll need to make sure you have a SIM-unlocked phone first. That means you can use a SIM card from any company without restrictions, so long as the hardware is compatible with the network.</p><p>Most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> are available unlocked, but if you&apos;re paying a monthly fee to your carrier for a phone, it&apos;s likely locked. Just be careful not to get trapped into a buy one lease one free agreement, with monthly bill credits that keep you on the carrier for 24 or 36 months. If you can&apos;t pay for the phone outright, you can often set up payment plans with the manufacturer, like Samsung, without getting locked into a carrier.</p>

<p>Storage manufacturers are continually increasing drive sizes — I tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x24-24tb-hdd-review">Seagate&apos;s excellent 24TB Exos X24 drive</a> earlier in the year — and the brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/30tb-hard-drives-with-hamr-tech-are-now-a-reality-and-im-thrilled">showcased a 30TB drive</a> based on Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR), dubbed the Exos Mozaic 3+, delivering 3TB on a single platter. Western Digital is now following suit with the introduction of the Ultrastar DC HC690, which uses a 11-platter design — one more than regular drives.</p><p>The DC HC690 is aimed at data center use, and is based on Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR). Similar to what Seagate is doing with HAMR, WD has turned to energy-assisted Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (ePMR) to increase areal density on the drive, and while the density isn&apos;t as high as what Seagate is offering — it goes up to 2.91TB/platter — it is considerably higher than the brand&apos;s regular NAS drives.</p><p>The drive is available in a SATA configuration with 6Gb/s bandwidth, or 12Gb/s SAS as well. It&apos;s sold in 30TB and 32TB sizes, spins at 7200rpm, and goes up to 267MB/s during sustained transfers. WD is also rolling out the 24TB and 26TB DC HC590, with these drives using Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) in conjunction with ePMR to deliver better density.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yrJTvEzX6kpGtw6vdssvfK" name="wd-32tb-drive-2.jpg" alt="WD Ultrastar DC HC690 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yrJTvEzX6kpGtw6vdssvfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Western Digital)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With both models designed to be used in the data center, it&apos;s unlikely WD will make these drives available in the retail channel. But what&apos;s particularly interesting is that the brand is rolling out a 26TB Gold HDD, and this is available on its website — you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-gold-sata-hdd?sku=WD261KRYZ">can pick it up for $715</a>. The CMR drive also uses a 11-platter design, comes with a 512MB cache, 2.5M hours MTBF, and 550TB/year endurance.</p><p>The Gold drive has a density of 2.36TB/platter, and it is a great choice for enthusiasts looking to maximize storage. I&apos;m waiting until 30TB and 32TB drives are available to retail consumers, but in the meantime, 24TB and 26TB drives are a viable alternative if you&apos;re looking to build a homelab that can store just about everything, or need a NAS with scalable storage in a small business environment.</p><p>The 24TB Exos X24 is down to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Exos-Enterprise-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CM293XCL">reasonable $479</a>, and that&apos;s a stellar value when you consider just how much storage you&apos;re getting. With WD joining the fray, we should see additional savings in this area. While NAS enclosures such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">F8 SSD Plus</a> showcase what&apos;s possible with all-flash servers, I&apos;m still going to turn to HDDs to store massive amounts of data.</p>

<p>Oura was the company that helped ignite the smart ring segment, and today we have many others that have joined the fold, including Samsung. Its biggest rival though has got to be RingConn which offers a very compelling product. If you&apos;re trying to decide between the newly launched Oura Ring 4 vs. RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring, you&apos;ve come to the right place. </p><p>Oura has brought some big changes with the ring 4 like a sleeker design with a more durable finish, more sizes, and a new sensing platform that promises to capture more accurate health data no matter how you wear the ring. It could very well be a great alternative to buying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">best fitness tracker</a>.</p><p>RingConn&apos;s Gen 2 Smart Ring has equally impressive specs and features, including the ability to detect sleep apnea. It&apos;s also cheaper than the Oura Ring 4 which potentially makes it more attractive to first-time smart ring buyers. Let&apos;s break down all the differences between the two so you can better decide which would be right for you.</p>
<h2 id="oura-ring-4-vs-ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-design-and-pricing-2">Oura Ring 4 vs. RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: Design and pricing</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-2.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Oura Ring 4 starts shipping from October 15, starting at $349. This price is only for the Silver and Black colors. The Brushed Silver and Stealth finishes cost $399, while the Gold and Rose Gold finishes are $499. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, the Ring 4 comes in a single style. You get a one-month membership for free at the time of purchase, after which you&apos;ll have to pay $5.99 a month or $69.99 a year for U.S. members. </p><p>The idea of having to pay more to access detailed reports and analysis of your own health data after already paying a premium upfront for the device is not something I&apos;m thrilled about, and I&apos;m sure many others would feel the same. </p><p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has a much more palatable starting price of $299, irrespective of the color choice. You only get three finishes though like Future Silver, Matte Black, and Royal Gold. The biggest advantage of RingConn is that you have access to all data that&apos;s monitored, forever, as nothing is hidden behind any subscription.</p>

<p>There&apos;s not a lot of flexibility to differentiate your product from others when designing a smart ring and so, on the surface, the Oura Ring 4 and the RingConn Gen 2 look quite similar. However examine them closer or try them on, and you might notice some big differences. The Oura Ring 4 gets a fully circular design with new recessed interior sensors at just 0.3mm, which means you won&apos;t feel any bumps when you wear it. This should make it a lot more comfortable to wear while carrying heavy items like dumbbells or grocery bags.</p><p>It also gets full titanium layering on the outside and interiors too. The ring 4 now comes in sizes from four to 15, and it has a thickness of around 2.8mm. Depending on the size, it can feel a bit heavy as the weight ranges from 3.3g to 5.2g. It has full water resistance up to a depth of 100m and can be used in a sauna and other water sports, but not diving.</p><p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has a mostly circular design too, but the interiors have two protruding divots for the LED sensors and a flat base between them. While this looks like it could be uncomfortable to wear, we found it to be the opposite when we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">reviewed the Gen 2 Smart Ring</a>. RingConn uses a titanium alloy for the exterior and a medical-grade epoxy for the interior of the ring. The glossy silver model that we tested held up well against scuffs and scratches with everyday use.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FZ28NkgQNTRR7wXSZsygca" name="Oura-Ring-4-1.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZ28NkgQNTRR7wXSZsygca.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Oura Ring 4 and the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring promise medical-grade accuracy in readings thanks to finely tuned sensors. Both smart rings can do continuous heart rate tracking, sleep tracking, activity monitoring, stress analysis, and cycle tracking for women. Without a subscription to Oura, the app will only show you sleep, readiness, and activity scores. With an active subscription though, you&apos;ll have access to more detailed reports about your sleep, 24/7 heart rate tracking, SpO2 sensing, VO2 Max readings, cycle insights, automatic activity detection, and much more. These reports are vital if you truly wish to make healthy lifestyle changes, but you&apos;ll need to pay extra to get it.</p><p>On the flip side, the RingConn Gen 2 offers most of these premium features for free, since there&apos;s no subscription involved. It goes a step further and even has continuous sleep apnea monitoring. The latter feature did take a big bite out of the ring&apos;s battery life when we tested it, which is something to keep in mind. Smart rings are also not the best for step tracking, although they are getting better. For best accuracy, it&apos;s better to rely on a wrist-based fitness tracker instead.</p><p>One area where the Oura Ring 4 has an advantage is its automatic activity detection and tracking for certain exercises. This is a premium feature but it makes tracking exercises seamless. Unfortunately, any kind of exercise tracking on the RingConn needs to be manually activated, which is just unnecessary added steps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.85%;"><img id="CvwgsfJnCdQadwkN8c4Vx7" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-hero-21-9.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring balanced inside its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CvwgsfJnCdQadwkN8c4Vx7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="1817" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One big advantage of the smart rings is the incredible battery life you get compared to any smartwatch. Since there&apos;s no screen to power or LTE network to connect to, a week&apos;s worth of runtime on one charge is not uncommon to see. The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring lasts for 10 to 12 days on one charge, which is incredible. You might see a drop if you do sleep apnea tracking, but it should still be more than a week before you&apos;ll need to charge it again. The best part is the charging case that comes with it can easily charge the ring no matter where you are, thanks to the built-in 500mAh battery. There&apos;s also an optional charging dock which can be bought separately. </p><p>The Oura Ring 4 can go for up to eight days (claimed time) on one charge, which is less than RingConn but an improvement over the Ring Gen 3. Sadly, you don&apos;t get a convenient charging case with it but a charging dock with a Type-C to Type-C cable. This means you&apos;ll need to plug it into a power bank or your laptop in order to charge it.</p>

<p>We absolutely loved the app experience of the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring. Information is laid out in an easy-to-read manner and there are only three main tabs to cycle through, making it easy to navigate. The app also has a great set of widgets on Android, which we found very useful. The Gen 2 is also compatible with iPhone and integrates with Apple Health. On Android though, we only noticed that it worked with Google Fit and not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>, at the time of our review anyway.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">launch of the Oura Ring 4</a>, the company also released a redesigned app which is supposed to make navigation a lot easier. This is a welcomed improvement since the app was pretty crowded given the amount of metrics the ring tracks. The new app will have three main views: Today, Vitals, and My Health, so you can quickly jump to the data you need. A neat addition is the Timeline view in the Today tab which gives you a glanceable snapshot of how you&apos;ve fared in the day so far. Oura&apos;s Labs feature is also finally coming to Android. This includes an AI-powered advisor to help interpret the wearer&apos;s health data.</p>

<p>We&apos;re yet to test the Oura Ring 4 and we have little doubt about the company&apos;s ability to deliver on the promised features, especially considering how well the Gen 3 ring performed. But going the Oura route means a committed monthly investment for the subscription if you want to make any sense of all the data it collects. It&apos;s also quite expensive for casual users as prices can go as high as $499 for the premium trims.</p><p>The majority of users should find the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring a good enough alternative, and it&apos;s the one I&apos;d recommend to most. It&apos;s more affordable than Oura, there are no subscription fees to get detailed reports and analysis of your data, and it has an amazingly good battery life which even trumps the Ring 4&apos;s claimed number.</p><p>You&apos;ll have to compromise in some places like manually tracking workouts. The sleep apnea feature can drain the battery a fair bit, even though that&apos;s one of its unique features. Overall, with a great app experience, durable design, and handy charge-on-the-go case, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is truly the one ring to rule them all.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition is rumored to drop on October 25.</li><li>This model allegedly boasts a super slim profile—only 4.9mm thick when unfolded and 10.6mm when folded.</li><li>Leaker Evan Blass also shared renders showing the back of the phone, which features three raised lenses in a bold camera bump.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s rumored slimmer Galaxy Z Fold 6 was expected to drop this month, and a new leak backs that up with fresh details on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition&apos;s launch date.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202410141458081323" target="_blank">FNNews</a> says Samsung is set to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> Special Edition on October 25 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-launch-date-leaks/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). This timing puts Samsung in a strong spot to take on its Chinese rivals, especially in terms of screen size and slim design, marking a big leap forward for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable smartphones</a>.</p><p>According to the report, the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition is just 4.9mm thick when unfolded and 10.6mm when folded—definitely an upgrade from the Z Fold 6&apos;s 5.6mm and 12.1mm measurements.</p><p>Back in July, a leak hinted that the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition could have a folded thickness between 10 and 11 millimeters. The latest report backs this up, adding more weight to the idea that this device will raise the bar for slim foldable phones.</p><p>Furthermore, leaker Evan Blass just shared two renders of the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Slim." The image shows off the back of the phone, with three cameras in a bold camera bump. The raised camera module, complete with individual camera rings, adds some thickness, showing how tricky it is to squeeze cameras into such a slim phone.</p><p>The camera setup in the render lines up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-galaxy-z-fold-6-special-edition-photo-rumors">past leaks about this device</a>. The rectangular bump makes it stand out compared to the individual cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, giving the render even more believability.</p><p>The camera module sports three raised lenses that look a lot like those on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. But from the side, there’s not much to take in—just a goldish tint and a pretty chunky border around the internal display.</p><p>The second render gives us a look at the slim side of the device. You can see two buttons—likely for the volume and power—set against a textured rose-gold mid-frame.</p><p>Unfortunately, the limited images don’t give us much to dive into. The leaker hasn’t named the exact device in the renders, but there’s a lot of buzz that it’s likely linked to the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition, which was rumored to be called the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim and aimed at the South Korean market.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Mobvoi has launched the TicWatch Atlas, a $350 rugged timepiece that offers a wallet-friendly alternative to premium smartwatches from Samsung and Apple without skimping on features.</li><li>It features a tough stainless steel design, sapphire crystal protection for its 1.43-inch display, and a redesigned button layout for easy use.</li><li>Internally, it runs on the Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1, has 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 628mAh battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Mobvoi has just dropped its newest smartwatch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobvoi.com/us/pages/ticwatchatlas" target="_blank">TicWatch Atlas</a>, a rugged timepiece packed with all the features you might need for your next adventure.</p><p>Currently, the rugged smartwatch market is mostly ruled by a few major players. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple’s Watch Ultra 2</a> and Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> are top contenders, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin offers a solid lineup</a> that&apos;s perfect for outdoor enthusiasts.</p><p>If the high prices of these options have got you feeling drained, Mobvoi&apos;s TicWatch Atlas is a great alternative. Priced at only $350, this smartwatch is loaded with features and built to last, offering a premium experience without the sky-high cost.</p><p>Building on the legacy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Pro 5 Enduro</a>, the TicWatch Atlas features a tough stainless steel build for added durability. It also protects its 1.43-inch display with sapphire crystal and has a fresh button layout for easier access.</p><p>Mobvoi claims that this watch is built to military-grade standards, making it tough enough for extreme conditions.</p><p>Following the success of the Pro 5 Enduro, the Atlas brings some impressive upgrades, like Heat Map Tracking to help you spot your favorite workout spots. It also adds a fall detection feature, which can send out an SOS alert to emergency services or a chosen contact if you take a tumble.</p><p>With health and performance at the forefront, the Atlas packs in 24/7 heart rate monitoring, SpO2 tracking, sleep analysis, and solid tools for managing stress.</p><p>Mobvoi also points out that the Atlas can now display key health metrics—like heart rate, calories burned, and VO2 Max—on its secondary ultra-low-power screen before you dive into your workouts.</p><p>Inside, the Atlas shares a lot of specs with its predecessor. It runs on the same Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1 wearable platform, comes with 2GB of RAM, and offers 32GB of storage. And the same 628mAh battery is keeping the lights on. Plus, it&apos;s packed with a bunch of integrated AI features.</p><p>With its hefty battery and smart power-saving tech, Mobvoi says the Atlas can go for up to 90 hours in Smart Mode and 45 hours in Essential Mode.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Atlas is running on Wear OS 4, even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update">out for a few months now</a>. While there’s a chance it could get an update down the line, there’s no set timeline for when that might happen.</p>

<p>The Oura Ring 4 is the latest and greatest smart ring from the Finnish company that started the wearable craze. However, the Oura Ring Gen 3 was the smart ring that led that trend, thanks to its impressive feature set, battery life, and small size.</p><p>When considering purchasing a smart ring, you&apos;re likely wondering if you should still go for the older Gen 3 or splurge for the newer model. Even if you already own the Oura Ring Gen 3, you may want to know if it&apos;s worth upgrading to the Oura Ring 4 for the extra battery life and other improvements.</p><p>This comparison should help you decide between the two and if it&apos;s worth switching out your Gen 3 for a 4, although the answer isn&apos;t as simple as you may think.</p>
<h2 id="oura-ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-design-2">Oura Ring 4 vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3KjubLK3oYtu4nr2A66MLb" name="Oura-Ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-02.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on the Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3KjubLK3oYtu4nr2A66MLb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first glance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> doesn&apos;t look all that different from the Oura Ring Gen 3. The newer model takes after the Horizon style of its predecessor, which features a fully circular design, while the older Heritage style has a flatter "top" section. Where the rings differ, however, is in the materials and the sensors.</p><p>Unlike the Gen 3, which has a titanium exterior and an epoxy interior, the Oura Ring 4 has an all-titanium design, which should improve overall durability. In addition, the sensors are now flush with the interior, whereas the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> has three raised bumps where the sensors go. Having them flush should make the ring more comfortable to wear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ukXtzTrmgboYMwWzjeSUaC" name="Oura-Ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-01.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukXtzTrmgboYMwWzjeSUaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4042" height="2274" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Heritage style Oura Ring Gen 3 only comes in four different colorways and finishes, the Horizon style has six options, which correspond with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-oura-ring-4-color-should-you-buy">Oura Ring 4 color options</a>. That includes black, silver, Brushed Titanium (Brushed Silver for the Oura Ring 4), Stealth, Gold, and Rose Gold. What you pay for the ring will depend on the color you choose, and for the Gen 3, it will also depend on the style. For comparison, the most expensive Oura Ring 4 colors are $50 cheaper than the most expensive Gen 3 colors, although the cheapest model is $50 more expensive.</p><p>Aside from the all-titanium design, the Oura Ring 4 has the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/is-the-oura-ring-4-waterproof">waterproof protection</a>, meaning it should be safe at depths up to 100 meters. The Oura Ring 4 is also available in more sizes than its predecessor, and the width has remained the same, although the thickness lies somewhere between the two Gen 3 styles, while the weight has been reduced overall.</p>

<p>Spec-wise, the Oura Ring 4 is actually pretty similar to the Oura Ring 3, with some differences in battery life, size options, and sensor layout (as well as the specific type of sensors.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-09.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 with the Android Bot figure" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both smart rings feature the standard set of health tracking features, including heart rate monitoring, SpO2, heart rate variability (HRV), temperature, and more. The Oura Ring Gen 3 featured superb health tracking features with the help of its sensor array and algorithms. The ring even supports automatic activity detection, meaning it can detect various activities based on your movements. However, its features are somewhat limited, with automatically tracked activities only showing limited information such as calories.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 improves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">Automatic Activity Detection</a> by including heart rate data when the ring automatically detects certain activities. You&apos;ll get a graph of your heart rate, your average HR, and a view of your heart rate zones while the activity was being detected, useful information for people seeking a more active lifestyle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="wooFHuUPnNkAZvvXwWLmqU" name="Oura-app-activity-heart-rate-details.jpg" alt="Oura app activity tracking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wooFHuUPnNkAZvvXwWLmqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while the Oura Ring Gen 3 is fairly accurate (although step counting is hit or miss), the Oura Ring 4 should prove more accurate when measuring things like blood oxygen levels. This is thanks to Oura&apos;s new Smart Sensing technology, which takes advantage of the new sensor array on the Oura Ring 4. Instead of static signals, the algorithm can find optimal pathways while on your finger, which can help it remain as accurate as possible, even as the ring shifts around. Oura says this is also aided by the all-titanium build on the new ring, and it has more than double the number of pathways.</p><p>With smart sensing, the Oura Ring 4 should also be able to respond better to people with different finger physiology, meaning users across genders, skin tones, and ages will benefit from better accuracy.</p><p>As a result, the Oura Ring 4 is 30% more accurate with blood oxygen readings than the Oura Ring Gen 3. You&apos;ll also find better heart rate monitoring with fewer gaps throughout the day and overnight.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-12.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Truth be told, both smart rings are at the top of their class. The Oura Ring 4 is obviously the better ring, but the Oura Ring Gen 3 is still no pushover, and both devices easily best other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">competing smart rings</a>. That said, if you had to choose between these two, I would recommend buying the Oura Ring 4, and here&apos;s why:</p><p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 and has been able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-resilience-metric-tracks-stress-recovery">add plenty of new features</a> to its repertoire, proving that smart rings have the kind of longevity and flexibility that doesn&apos;t require yearly model updates like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>. However, it&apos;s been a few years already and the Oura Ring Gen 3 is seemingly at the end of the line. Oura says that it will continue to sell the Gen 3 but at a discount, and once stock runs out, that&apos;s it.</p><p>Meanwhile, given what we know about the Gen 3, the newer Oura Ring 4 will likely receive the same treatment, receiving new features while it&apos;s available (and perhaps beyond). So, with the Oura Ring 4 having just launched, this is probably the best time to get one.</p>
<p>However, it&apos;s a little different if you already <em>have</em> the Gen 3. Oura doesn&apos;t offer any upgrade perks or discounts, so there&apos;s no real pathway to "upgrade" your ring besides outright buying a new one. And while that may seem tempting (if you have the money, go for it), you&apos;re probably best sticking with the Gen 3 until it completely dies.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>After several months of testing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> made it to stable release, and the update is now rolling out to eligible Pixel devices. Google showcased dozens of new features in the beta testing phase, but like previous years, not all features made it to the stable build. Either they&apos;re not fully ready, or Google decided to hold back features until later releases.</p><p>This was the case with the predictive back gesture, which showed up initially in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> beta but is only rolling out widely with Android 15. While Android 16 is still a few months away — the initial preview builds should go live at the end of February 2025 — we know a decent amount about the next version of Android.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="usUCsFE8ymUB2rjF9HTzYo" name="android-15-devices-2.jpg" alt="List of devices getting Android 15 beta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usUCsFE8ymUB2rjF9HTzYo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 16 will make its way to more devices than just about any other Android version. With most brands now offering at least three Android OS updates to their budget and mid-range phones, Android 16 will be available to most devices launched in the last two years. Budget phones have been ignored for far too long, and the fact that they will get long-term updates is a big deal.</p><p>When it comes to Google&apos;s own devices, all Pixels starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7</a> series will be able to switch to Android 16. That leaves out the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and all older Pixels, but these devices will continue to get feature updates and security patches. With Google now guaranteeing seven years of software updates — even on the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> — updates aren&apos;t going to be a problem in the future.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-android-16-s-internal-codename"><span>What is Android 16's internal codename?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google used dessert names with Android versions in the past, and while it doesn&apos;t do so any longer — that ended with Android 10 — it still maintains internal codenames. Android 15 was Vanilla Ice Cream, and with Android 16, you&apos;d assume Google to go with a dessert that starts with the letter W, like waffle.</p><p>Instead, Android 16 has an internal codename dubbed Baklava. Google is changing how it&apos;s assigning the codenames for Android releases, and while it&apos;s still maintaining dessert-based monikers, it effectively started over.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-new-features-coming-to-android-16"><span>New features coming to Android 16</span></h3>
<h2 id="notification-cooldown-turns-down-the-noise-2">Notification cooldown turns down the noise</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg" name="android-15-notifications.jpg" alt="Android 15 notification cooldown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notification cooldown is a great new feature that lowers the volume of incoming notifications when you get successive notifications from within the same app. So if you&apos;re in a group chat and start getting constant notifications, your phone automatically lowers the volume of subsequent notifications. </p><p>What&apos;s great is that you can select this setting for just conversations, or all apps. As someone who doesn&apos;t like getting many notification alerts (I use DND most of the day), this is a great new addition, and one that I will use to good effect.</p>
<h2 id="an-actual-desktop-mode-2">An actual desktop mode</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-desktop.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra on desk in DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">DeX mode</a> on its high-end devices, but the brand is an outlier in this regard, and most Android devices don&apos;t have a desktop mode. That may change with Android 16; later Android 15 beta builds had a desktop mode with app windows, and while it isn&apos;t available in the stable build, it&apos;s clear that Google is working on enabling a desktop mode in Android.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s feature is still much better; the brand has been tweaking DeX for nearly half a decade now, and it is a mature platform. That said, I&apos;m very excited to see a native desktop mode make its way to Android 16.</p>
<h2 id="limit-charging-to-80-2">Limit charging to 80%</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m" name="battery-settings-on-pixel-9-pro-xl.jpg" alt="Battery screen on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This feature was available in the Android 15 beta, but there&apos;s no mention of it in the stable release. The charging optimization mode is in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-begins">Android 15 QPR1 build</a>, so Google will likely roll it out with that update, or push it to the wider Android 16 release.</p><p>As the name suggests, the feature allows you to limit the battery to 80%, prolonging its longevity considerably. While a few manufacturers have this feature in their own skin, it makes to see it baked into Android natively.</p>
<h2 id="audio-sharing-should-be-easier-in-android-16-2">Audio sharing should be easier in Android 16</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="urcipt6frvrTMcHqmQjckW" name="nothing-ear-2-25.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (2) earbuds review on red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/urcipt6frvrTMcHqmQjckW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new feature that showed up in initial Android 15 betas but isn&apos;t available in the stable release is the ability to cast music to several Bluetooth devices at the same time. The Audio sharing sub-menu is located within the Connected devices page, and it lets you cast music to more than one Bluetooth device at a time. I really wanted to see this feature in Android 15, but given how buggy it was, it&apos;s clear that Google is pushing it to next year.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-16-is-coming-soon"><span>Android 16 is coming soon</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NMKzfoCA9KYCgfxHqqEUJn" name="android-14-pixel-9-pro-xl-android-15-pixel-9-pro-fold-2.jpg" alt="Android 14 on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Android 15 on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMKzfoCA9KYCgfxHqqEUJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don&apos;t have to wait too long to get an initial preview into Android 16. Google usually rolls out a dev preview in Q1, and while the early builds are buggy and don&apos;t have much in the way of new features, they act as the foundation for further testing.</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t changed its beta program in nearly a decade, and that&apos;s unlikely to be the case next year. That means we should get the public beta builds around May, with a stable release in Q4. Of course, this is all conjecture at this point, and we will know more once Google starts rolling out preview builds of Android 16.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Motorola revealed a new AI concept that allows your phone to understand its surroundings and tackle tasks just by having a casual chat.</li><li>Although it's still in the proof-of-concept stage, this technology could learn from your habits and turn natural language into actions, making it feel like you have a personal assistant.</li><li>Motorola is also enhancing other AI features, like Moto AI, which launched with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and is gradually expanding in beta testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today at Lenovo&apos;s Tech World 2024 event, Motorola showcased a new AI-powered concept that could turn your phone into a do-it-all device.</p><p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-at-tech-world-2024/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it&apos;s exploring a new project that combines Large Action Models (LAM) with Moto AI’s smarts. This proof-of-concept tech lets your phone pick up on your environment and handle tricky tasks by just chatting with it naturally.</p><p>The company gives a simple example: say, "order me an iced americano," and Moto AI will find a nearby coffee shop, place the order, and let you know when it’s ready. This same feature can also handle your regular tasks like hailing a ride.</p><p>While it’s still in the proof-of-concept phase, this tech could understand your environment, learn from your habits to give personalized responses, and turn natural language into actions all on its own. Essentially, Motorola&apos;s LAMs are like smart assistants that can interact with you in a human-like way using everyday language.</p><p>These features give Motorola&apos;s concept a unique twist compared to Apple and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google&apos;s AI tools</a>. The LAM technology aims to take action in response to your requests instead of just spitting out text or images.</p><p>On the other hand, Google’s upgraded Gemini digital assistant can handle questions about what’s on your screen and interact with other apps.</p><p>Even though this technology is only a proof of concept for now, Motorola is also pushing forward with other AI-driven features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-could-pack-a-game-changing-camera-upgrade">Moto AI</a>, launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> earlier this year, is gradually expanding its AI features in a beta testing phase.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the company showcased several Moto AI features, including Catch Me Up and Remember This. The Catch Me Up feature helps you quickly catch up on notifications by giving you a prioritized summary, saving you from having to scroll through a long list of missed alerts.</p><p>The Pay Attention feature makes it easy for users to keep track of instructions without having to write them down or record lengthy audio notes. Meanwhile, Remember This lets you save live moments or on-screen info when activated.</p><p>However, there’s no word yet on which devices are included in this beta testing or how participants are chosen. Motorola plans to gradually roll out beta invitations over the year.</p>
