                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google&apos;s latest midrange masterpiece was finally announced this morning, and Verizon has wasted no time in dropping one of the best Google Pixel 8a deals we&apos;ve seen yet. Preorder the Pixel 8a ahead of its May 14th release date and you&apos;ll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-8a/"><strong>get the phone for free</strong></a> when you add a line with an eligible unlimited plan. No trade-in is required, and I&apos;m not just talking about Verizon&apos;s most expensive plan options here either: the Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, AND Unlimited Ultra plans are all eligible for the promotion. </p>

<p>Add a line to your Verizon service with the Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, or Unlimited Ultimate plan and the carrier will hook you up with enough promo credits to make the new <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> totally free. No trade-in required! Sure, you're still paying for the wireless plan, but this is a pretty impressive promotion for a smartphone that isn't even out yet. </p>
<p>The Unlimited Welcome plan would be the most affordable option here, starting at $65 per month for a single line (although the plan can drop as low as $30 per month when you add additional lines).<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-8a/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="252d91f7-f34e-4644-8043-3859b5bcced5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 8a 128GB: $499" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 8a 128GB: $499">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deal</a> makes the most sense if you&apos;re already a customer or you&apos;re interested in making the switch. If you prefer to buy your phones unlocked, however, there are already several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">Google Pixel 8a preorder deals</a> that might be worth checking out (with plenty more on the way). </p><p>Either way, you&apos;ll be getting one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> expected to hit store shelves in 2024, coming complete with a gorgeous 120Hz display, some flagship-quality camera tech, and the same Tensor G3 processor that&apos;s behind the flagship Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. The Google Pixel 8a also features a bigger battery than its predecessor, and you&apos;ll be guaranteed to receive seven years of OS upgrades.</p><p>Like we mentioned above, the Google Pixel 8a is slated for release on May 14th, the same day as Google I/O 2024. The 128GB version will retail for $499 in the United States, while the larger 256GB storage configuration will set you back $599. </p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>A cheaper alternative </strong></em></p>
<p>For those who have been waiting for a cheaper alternative to the Google Pixel 8 Pro and Google Pixel 8, the Google Pixel 8a is the answer. Like the Google Pixel 7a, it’s a step down but still a feature-rich phone that provides a solid experience for a value price. Rather than downgrade to the Google Pixel 7 to save money, you can get the latest in the line for a similar price point.</p></p>

The screen is beautiful and bright, the finish and materials elegant and stylish, and it has plenty of RAM and up to 1TB storage to keep up with your daily needs. But you’ll pay more for it.</p></p>

<p>Now that you know the Google Pixel 8a exists, the decision comes down to the Google Pixel 8a vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro. On the one hand, you save money and still get a new device with the Google Pixel 8a. On the other, you aren’t getting the most premium experience. Which way should you go? We’re here to help with this detailed comparison of the two Pixel phones.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-the-look-and-basics-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: The look and basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vk8nBQLetvaiFmUpZZBPG" name="google-pixel-8a-official-lifestyle-aloe-01.jpg" alt="A person holding an Aloe Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vk8nBQLetvaiFmUpZZBPG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 8a is Google’s “budget” entry option in the latest 8 line. Prior to its launch, if you wanted a step down from the Google Pixel 8, your best option would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Google Pixel 7</a> or even the Google Pixel 7a. This device offers upgraded specs compared to those phones while still keeping the price down for a current device. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8a has a 6.1-inch Actua OLED display that boasts 1,080 x 2,400 resolution and up to 120Hz refresh rate. You get a decent up to 1,400 nits brightness in HDR or up to 2,000 nits peak brightness, which is great for viewing outdoors. It isn’t quite as bright and beautiful as the screen on the Google Pixel 8 Pro, but Google says it’s 40 percent brighter than the Pixel 7a screen. </p><p>The always-on screen is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 with a fingerprint-resistant coating, and it’s made from a matte composite with a matte aluminum frame. So, it isn’t as durable, but considering you’ll be using a protective case, this might not matter much for regular everyday use. It comes in Obsidian and Porcelain and, for the first time with an A-series device, Bay, along with a brand-new limited edition Aloe finish. The Google Pixel 8a is also IP67 water- and dust-resistant, so slightly less rugged in this respect than the Pixel 8 Pro. </p><p>For the first time with an A-series model, you can choose from 128 GB or 256GB storage. This isn’t expandable, though, as with the Google Pixel 8 Pro. The Pixel 8a runs Android 14 and promises seven years of OS and security updates as well as frequent Feature Drops. So, like with other new Pixel devices, you can be assured that this phone will last you a long time. </p><p>Speaking of lasting, it has a 4,492mAh battery that Google says lasts for more than a day and can extend to up to 72 hours using the Extreme Battery Saver mode. It also supports both fast and wireless charging, the latter with Qi-certified chargers. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8a includes face and fingerprint unlock just like its bigger sisters along with stereo speakers with two mics and noise suppression, though you won’t get support for Spatial Audio. There’s no headphone jack, as is typical with most phones nowadays.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-back-porcelain-01.jpg" alt="The matte glass on the back of the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does this compare to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>? The flagship has a larger 6.7-inch Super Actua LTPO OLED display that boasts a higher resolution at 1,344 x 2992. It’s also brighter at 1,600 nits with a peak brightness up to 2,400 nits, so if you use your phone a lot outdoors in bright sunlight, this might matter to you. The refresh rate is adaptive as well at 1-120Hz, so it can keep up with demanding tasks. </p><p>The screen employs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cornings-new-gorilla-glass-victus-can-survive-drop-2-meters">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus</a>, which is more durable and resistant against scratches and fingerprints. But again, with a protective case, which is recommended for any phone, as well as a screen protector, this might not be a dealbreaker. This phone also has a higher IP68 water- and dust-resistant rating. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro comes in three finishes, Porcelain, Bay, and Obsidian, and you get the option for 512GB and 1TB capacities as well as 128GB and 256GB. If you plan to download a lot of apps and store tons of photos and other content and don’t want to rely on cloud storage, this phone is the better option since you can get tons more onboard storage. Of course, you’re also paying more for it. Keep in mind that the Google Pixel 8 Pro comes with a six-month trial compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> Premium, which includes 2TB cloud storage. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> as well, with the same promise of seven years of OS and security updates. It has a larger 5,500mAh battery that can also last for up to 24 hours or longer, up to 72 hours, with the Extreme Battery Saver mode. This phone also supports fast charging and fast wireless charging, along with Battery Share for recharging compatible devices like Pixel Buds with the phone.   </p><p>Along with the same fingerprint and face unlock, you get stereo speakers, three mics with noise suppression, and support for Spatial Audio. So, you’ll enjoy a better audio experience with this phone. This device also does not have a headphone jack.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8-pro-vs-google-pixel-fold-the-specifications-2">Google Pixel 8 Pro vs. Google Pixel Fold: The specifications</h2>
<p>Let’s break things down by specs to paint a clearer picture of how these two Google Pixel phones compare and contrast with one another.</p>

<p>It’s obvious from these specs that the Google Pixel 8a is a step down from the Google Pixel 8 Pro in several ways. But it’s all a matter of price and what you need and value the most.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mGEzzuDVBtLfDKfoZVBdQZ" name="pixel 8a parts.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mGEzzuDVBtLfDKfoZVBdQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Google Pixel 8a is a less powerful device than the Google Pixel 8 Pro. As noted, they both come loaded with Android 14, and both also include the Google Tensor G3 chip. You get less RAM with the Google Pixel 8a at just 8GB, but this is still respectable: you can expect the phone to meet your daily needs. </p><p>From a security perspective, you get VPN by Google One included with a purchase of the phone along with Google’s standard end-to-end security, which comes with every Pixel device. There’s also the Tensor security core, Titan M2 security chip, and anti-malware and phishing protection, all of which are par for the course with Pixel devices. Using Family Link, you can manage privacy settings, establish screen time limits, and share location, useful for parents getting this device for kids. </p><p>Interestingly, the Google Pixel 8a has all the same AI goodies as its bigger sister, like Circle to Search for easily searching for a subject or object by circling or scribbling over it, and Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> built-in AI assistant, once you enable extensions, just hold the power button to ask Gemini to do things like summarize an e-mail, help you brainstorm ideas, write a thank you note, or even plan a vacation. </p><p>There’s also Pixel Call Assist, Call Screen, Direct My Call, Hold for Me, Clear Calling, and other features. A fun new feature, presumably that will also be accessible in the Google Pixel 8 Pro, is called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-audio-emoji-update-spotted">Audio Emoji</a>. Effectively, you can create your own soundtrack on a call, playing audio “emoji” like applause or laughing as part of the conversation.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro has all that and more. Along with the Google Tensor G3 chip and Google AI, it has more RAM at 12GB. Note, however, that Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich says he didn’t notice much of a difference when gaming with the Pixel 8 Pro over previous generation devices with the Google Tensor G2 chip. So, keep this in mind if you plan to do a lot of mobile gaming. The Google Pixel 8 Pro is still the better option between the two in this respect, though. It will be snappier and better for gaming, multi-tasking, and other high-resource apps. </p><p>Along with features like Call Screen to automatically screen and filter out spam calls, you can enjoy AI functions like Live Translate and an improved Google Assistant experience that can summarize web pages, even translate them, help you compose messages, and more. </p><p>It has the same security features, including VPN by Google One and the Titan M2 chip, and adds others like crisis alerts and car crash detection. While the built-in temperature sensor in the Google Pixel 8 Pro is a nice-to-have feature, there’s still some work to do with it, so it isn’t a deal-breaking feature. </p><p>For fitness folks, the Google Pixel 8 Pro comes with a six-month Fitbit Premium trial as well as three months of YouTube Premium if you love to watch videos on the device. This is a nice incentive that could sway you in the direction of this phone, too, especially if you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> or another compatible Fitbit device.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-the-cameras-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DwGUL6HR9yAXoAVt3xJnf" name="google-pixel-8a-colorway-montage.jpg" alt="A montage of all the Google Pixel 8a colorways" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DwGUL6HR9yAXoAVt3xJnf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking photos from your mobile device is important. For some, in fact, the cameras could be the deciding factor between two phones. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8a comes out of the gate with a main camera that has a larger 64MP quad PD wide camera with Super Res Zoom up to 8x. It has a 13MP ultra-wide camera, ideal for getting group of panoramic scenic shots. This is complemented by the decent 13MP front camera, which has an ultra-wide field-of-view so you can get everyone in the photo and is actually higher resolution than the front camera in the Google Pixel 8 Pro. </p><p>You can enjoy all the typical Google Pixel photo editing and capture features like Magic Editor for repositioning and resizing objects and using preset backgrounds, Best Take for adjusting facial expressions for each person in a photo to get the best one (Sutrich says it works flawlessly), Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Real Tone, Face Unblur, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, and more. There’s also Audio Magic Eraser for videos, which removes distracting background noises. So, you’re getting all the same great features, but the cameras themselves aren’t the same. </p><p>With that said, we haven’t yet put the cameras in this phone through their paces, so we can’t compare head-to-head. But based on specs alone, and the expectation that the Google Pixel 8 Pro provides a superior experience, keep this in mind. Also consider that the Google Pixel 8 and even the Google Pixel 7a take wonderful photos, so you likely won’t be disappointed with the cameras in the Google Pixel 8a. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-camera-bar-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro camera bar in the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of specs, the Google Pixel 8 Pro has a 50MP main camera, 48MP telephoto camera, 48MP ultra-wide camera with improved Macro focus, and 10.5MP front camera, so its front camera is actually lower resolution than the Google Pixel 8a. The Super Res Zoom is superior, however, going up to 30x. You get those same photo editing features like Photo Unblur, Magic Eraser, Face Unblur, Real Tone, Night Sight, and Best Take, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a> and, of course, Portrait mode. </p><p>There are some professional-level camera controls worth mentioning with the Google Pixel 8 Pro, including advanced camera settings for shutter speed, ISO, and more. There’s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> for videos, which, as mentioned, you get in the Google Pixel 8a as well. Sutrich says it works “unbelievably well.”</p>

<p>Now, it’s decision time. Which should you buy between the Google Pixel 8a vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro? It really comes down to budget and needs. If you just want a simple device for an affordable price, go with the Google Pixel 8a, which will easily rank among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>. You’ll save a ton while also still coming out with premium features that are typically only reserved for higher-end models like the Google Pixel 8 Pro and Google Pixel 8. These range from photo editing tools to a wonderful primary and even selfie camera, fast processor, and lots of AI goodies. </p><p>If you want the best of the best, go with the Google Pixel 8 Pro. It is more powerful overall, has a more elegant and durable build, more RAM, larger storage options, and additional cameras. All the Google AI goodies will come in handy, and you may use them more than you think you will. </p><p>The nice Goldilocks option, if you can’t decide, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>, which sits neatly between these two devices. It has many of the same features with a few step-ups in design, build, and specs compared to the Pixel 8a, but with a smaller screen and some concessions compared to the Google Pixel 8 Pro. See our comparison between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-vs-google-pixel-8-pro">Google Pixel 8 Pro vs. Google Pixel 8</a> to decide which one would suit you better if you think the Google Pixel 8a is too entry-level for you. </p><p>But as a fabulous first phone, secondary phone, or even a device for a teen or tween, the Google Pixel 8a is offered at a great price with tons of features to rival even some higher-end phones. If you prefer the smaller screen size, that might be enough to sway you towards this phone. For average, everyday use, good photos, and even the option to play around with AI features, the Google Pixel 8a is worth considering. </p><p>The bottom line: no matter which of the Pixel 8 devices you choose, you can rest assured that it will keep up with demanding tasks, take great photos, and provide an intuitive and pleasurable experience. The best part is that with seven years of updates promised for all three, you can easily sell or trade-in one and upgrade if needed, and the phone will retain its value for years to come.</p>

<p>Comparing the Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 8 requires diving deep into Google&apos;s tech specs for both phones. Intentionally designed to be quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> shares common traits like its Tensor G3 chip, 120Hz FHD display, and seven years of OS updates. </p><p>Launching at $499, the Pixel 8a is similar enough to the Pixel 8 ($699) that you&apos;re probably wondering where the price difference comes in. Many of the differences are minor, but you might decide that you can&apos;t live without specific Pixel 8 upgrades like its auto-focusing cameras</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:716px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="v4xcb6kXnVfxKPm8EQL9c7" name="google-pixel-8a-colors-169.jpg" alt="All of the official color options for the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4xcb6kXnVfxKPm8EQL9c7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="716" height="403" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The four Pixel 8a color options </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite its slightly smaller display, the 6.1-inch Pixel 8a is one gram heavier and about 1.5mm taller and wider than the 6.2-inch Pixel 8. You&apos;ll notice aluminum bezels along the 8a&apos;s front, while the Pixel 8 is thinner along the edge. That being said, you won&apos;t notice a difference holding them, especially once you add a case. </p><p>Both Pixels use recycled aluminum for the camera bar and side frame, but the Pixel 8a has a matte composite back, while the Pixel 8 has a glossy glass back with Gorilla Glass Victus protection. It&apos;s a judgment call whether you prefer a matte or gloss look, but most of the AC staff prefer the Pixel 8a&apos;s matte look since it&apos;s less likely to accentuate fingerprints.</p><p>They share that classic Pixel camera bar aesthetic, with the dual camera sensors aligned to the left cutout and the LED on the right. It gives the Pixel 8a a unique look compared to most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="owRGtn4hGbgqgRqWoroKZH" name="pixel-8-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 camera bar close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owRGtn4hGbgqgRqWoroKZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8 ships in Obsidian, Hazel, Mint, and Rose, while the Pixel 8a has Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay, and Aloe.</p><p>One non-aesthetic design difference to note: the Pixel 8a only hits IP67 protection, slightly below the Pixel 8&apos;s IP68 protection. Technically, both phones can be submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes, but the Pixel 8 is more likely to survive at slightly greater depths or longer durations. Don&apos;t go swimming with either phone, though.</p><p>While both phones have stereo speakers, the Pixel 8 has one extra microphone (3) than the Pixel 8a (2), which could make your voice clearer for phone calls. </p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-8-display-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 8: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GryJcEWXbjLvqtupDhaqvL" name="pixel-8-23.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GryJcEWXbjLvqtupDhaqvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Spec-wise, the 6.2-inch Pixel 8 and 6.1-inch Pixel 8a displays are extremely similar, aside from the slight size difference. </p><p>They share AMOLED displays with 2400 x 1080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rates (a step up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>&apos;s 90Hz display). They each hit 1,400 nits for HDR or 2,000 nits for peak brightness. Visually, they have the same 1-million-to-1 contrast ratio and 16 million colors. Technically, the Pixel 8a beats the Pixel 8 by two pixels per inch (430 vs. 428), but you won&apos;t notice. </p><p>Both phones have a flat-edged design — none of the curving you get with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> or other flagships — and an in-display optical fingerprint sensor.</p><p>As mentioned before, the Pixel 8 has slightly smaller bezels than the Pixel 8a, which looks more visually appealing. Plus, the Pixel 8a only has Gorilla Glass 3, which is much less durable against cracks and scratches than the Victus on the mainline Pixel 8.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-8-hardware-and-cameras-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 8: Hardware and cameras</h2>

<p>Google gave the Pixel 8a the same Tensor G3 chip, 8GB of RAM, and UFS 3.1 storage as the Pixel 8, presumably making their performance identical. Be warned, though: we learned that the Pixel 7a had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7a-tensor-g2-alleged-packaging">slightly worse version of the Tensor G2</a> a month after launch, so we can&apos;t be certain of the 8a&apos;s performance until we test it for ourselves. </p><p>Google&apos;s spec sheets list both phones as lasting 24 hours in normal conditions or 72 hours in Extreme Battery Saver mode. Specifically, the Pixel 8 has a typical 4,575mAh capacity or 4,485mAh minimum; the Pixel 8a hits 4,492mAh (typical) or 4,404mAh (minimum). </p><p>While the Pixel 8 does "win" here, the extra capacity will go straight to the extra display space, so it should be a wash. The Pixel 8 averaged about six hours of active screen time in our review testing, so expect the Pixel 8a to last about the same amount of time. </p><p>Google lists both phones as having "Fast Charging," but only the Pixel 8 has a guaranteed 50% charge in 30 minutes with 27W speeds. The Pixel 8a is only rated to hit 18W charging. While the Pixel 8 took about 75 minutes to recharge fully, we expect the Pixel 8a will take slightly longer. </p><p>As for wireless charging, the Pixel 8a will likely use the same (painfully slow) 5W charging as the Pixel 7a, giving the Pixel 8 the advantage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">wireless charging pad</a> owners.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG" name="google-pixel-8a-official-lifestyle-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="A person holding an Obsidian Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the key Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 8 differences pertain to camera specs and features. </p><p>While the Pixel 8a main camera has 64 megapixels to the Pixel 8&apos;s 50, the latter has an "Octa PD" system that enables autofocus shots, while the Pixel 8a has fixed focus. For point-and-shoot photography, the Pixel 8 is the simpler user option. You also have a lower aperture for better light capture. Both main sensors have 8X Super Res Zoom and optical image stabilization. </p><p>Only the Pixel 8 ultrawide camera has autofocus, and it gives you about six extra degrees of width on its shots. Both have the same aperture, but the Pixel 8a has a smaller pixel size. </p><p>For the front camera, both phones use a fixed-focus lens. Once again, the Pixel 8a selfie has a higher resolution (13MP)  and the same aperture, while the Pixel 8 has a 10.5MP dual PD camera with a larger pixel size. Of the two, only the Pixel 8 can film 4K 60FPS selfie videos, while the Pixel 8a maxes at 30FPS. </p><p>Thanks to its Tensor G3 chip, the Pixel 8a has most of its more expensive sibling&apos;s epic Google AI tricks, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>. However, Google reserves a couple of tricks for the Pixel 8, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus</a>, Macro Focus Video, and Cinematic Blur. </p>

<p>Whether you buy the Pixel 8 or Pixel 8a, you&apos;ll get seven years of software updates and security updates. Both launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, which means they&apos;ll receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-android-21-look-like-on-pixel-8">Android 21 in seven years</a>. </p><p>It&apos;s fair to ask whether the Tensor G3 will hold up for that long, and you can rest assured that neither phone will get whatever new camera tricks come to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>. Nevertheless, this longevity is appreciated since it could increase both phones&apos; eventual trade-in value. </p><p>Google has also promised to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to the Pixel 8a, in addition to popular AI tricks on the mainline Pixels like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pixel-call-assist">Pixel Call Assist</a>.</p><p>Both phones support most 5G bands, including mmWave, in the United States. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> router, the Pixel 8 is better equipped to take advantage of the extra speed; the Pixel 8a will get the benefits of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wi-fi-6e-router">Wi-Fi 6E routers</a>, at least. Also, the Pixel 8 has dual-band GPS support for better accuracy while using Google Maps, while the Pixel 8a might be more prone to signal blockage.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As of publication, the Pixel 7a sits on our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, though the Pixel 8a is likely to supplant it once we&apos;ve reviewed it. It has the same perks — a mainline Tensor chip, Google AI processing behind solid cameras, and a cool design — while fixing many of its drawbacks, like the glossy back, dim brightness, lower refresh rate, and lack of 256B storage option. </p><p>The Pixel 8 still has the 8a beat in a couple of areas. Maybe you like to go caseless and need extra protection, have a Wi-Fi 7 router, like macro photography, or are really passionate about wireless charging. Otherwise, I think you can happily buy the Pixel 8a without the fear of missing out on anything drastic, especially since you&apos;ve gone this long without buying the Pixel 8. </p>

<p>The biggest difference with the Pixel 8a is that the phone finally gets a 120Hz panel, bringing it on par with other mid-range devices. Google is also rolling out the same seven-year software update guarantee as the regular Pixel 8 series, and that gives the Pixel 8a a distinct edge in this category — no other mid-range phone will get as many updates. The cameras haven't changed, but you get all the latest AI features that debuted on the Pixel 8, and there's a 256GB model this time. The phone is costlier than last year, but the upgrades combined with long-term software updates means the Pixel 8a is an easy recommendation.</p></p>

<p>The Pixel 7a still has a lot to offer in 2024, and there isn't any area where the phone falls short. That said, it has a tendency to overheat during extended gaming sessions, so if playing games is a priority, you should look at the Pixel 8a instead. The cameras are the best in this segment, you get clean software, and the battery lasts a day. However, the Pixel 8a offers much better upgrades, and unless you're getting a great deal on the Pixel 7a, I'd suggest going with the 8a.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vk8nBQLetvaiFmUpZZBPG" name="google-pixel-8a-official-lifestyle-aloe-01.jpg" alt="A person holding an Aloe Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vk8nBQLetvaiFmUpZZBPG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a distinct design aesthetic, and it hasn&apos;t deviated too much from that path with the Pixel 8a. The phone is nearly identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, so you get the same camera bar at the back that runs along the width, with the camera modules housed inside.</p><p>The key difference this time is that the phone has rounded corners, and that makes it a look a little more elegant while being easier to hold and use. Google is also rolling out exciting color options, with the Pixel 8a available in Aloe, Bay, Obsidian, and Porcelain. Aloe has a green hue that is quite striking, and Bay is the same great blue variant that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but it looks a little more vibrant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="49AVQgVxLWzNimwEovQZeL" name="Google-Pixel-7a-back-02.jpg" alt="The back of the Charcoal Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/49AVQgVxLWzNimwEovQZeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is still using a polycarbonate back and an aluminum mid-frame, but the brand is using more recycled materials this time around. Interestingly, the Pixel 8a is touted to be more durable, but I don&apos;t know what that translates to in terms of real-world use — I&apos;ll share more after I&apos;ve used the phone for a while.</p><p>The Pixel 8a has roughly the same dimensions as the 7a, and coming in at 188g, it is a smidgen lighter. I like the Aloe and Bay color options, and while Google had issues with launching its more interesting colorways outside the U.S., it is doing a better job on that front — all four colors should be coming to all regions.</p>
<p>Given the similarities between the two devices, there isn&apos;t much to talk about the Pixel 7a. The phone has muted color choices, has a great in-hand feel, and I didn&apos;t see any issues on the design side of things after several months of usage. Both phones have IP67 ingress protection, giving them added resilience against the elements. On the whole, there really isn&apos;t much to distinguish the two devices in this area, but the rounded edges along with vibrant colors give the Pixel 8a a slender edge.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a-display-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 7a: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kdn7pHjPhJBkcTujnXXvP3" name="Google-pixel-7a-gaming-polytopia.jpg" alt="Playing the game Polytopia on a Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kdn7pHjPhJBkcTujnXXvP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has been stingy with refresh rate on its mid-range phones; the Pixel 6a had a 60Hz panel, and the Pixel 7a came with a 90Hz panel. That&apos;s thankfully changing with the Pixel 8a — the phone has a 120Hz OLED panel, and it uses the same Actua tech that the brand debuted with the Pixel 8.</p><p>The screen gets noticeably brighter, going up to as high as 2,000 nits in HDR mode. Google hasn&apos;t changed the screen size, so you still get a 6.1-inch panel with a resolution of 2400 x 1080, and it has a layer of Gorilla Glass 3, just like the Pixel 7a. The always-on mode and At A Glance and Now Playing features are intact as well.</p><p>The switch to 120Hz is the biggest talking point, and it gives the Pixel 8a a sizeable advantage over the 7a. The 90Hz panel on the Pixel 7a is decent enough in its own right, but you can make out a difference when using the device alongside a 120Hz phone. So I&apos;m glad Google finally decided to roll out 120Hz refresh to the Pixel 8a, and it makes the device that much more enticing.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a-hardware-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 7a: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W7ny4Hfq5wDz5NcBTChgsd" name="google-pixel-8a-official-parts.jpg" alt="The Aloe Google Pixel 8a alongside recycled materials" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7ny4Hfq5wDz5NcBTChgsd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not much has changed on the hardware side of things; the Pixel 8a gets the usual silicon upgrade, with the phone rocking Google&apos;s latest Tensor G3 platform. It has newer cores and much better performance, but thermal management is an unknown at this point. The Pixel 7a was severely constrained in this area, and even the Pixel 8 struggles with demanding workloads at times.</p><p>In that context, it will be interesting to see how the Pixel 8a holds up. The phone has the same 8GB of RAM as last year, and this time, Google is rolling out a 256GB model in addition to the base 128GB version. Limiting the Pixel 7a to 128GB was an oversight on Google&apos;s part last year, and I&apos;m glad to see the brand addressing that issue this time.</p>

<p>That said, the Pixel 8a has UFS 3.1 storage modules, and it misses out on the fastest UFS 4.0 storage. This doesn&apos;t make a difference in real-world use (at least not right now), but with the device slated to last the better part of a decade, UFS 4.0 would have been the better choice.</p><p>Coming to the battery, the Pixel 8a has a larger 4492mAh battery — versus the 4385mAh unit on the 7a — and it should last a little longer. It has the same 18W charging and 7.5W wireless charging as the Pixel 7a, and you don&apos;t get a charger in the box.</p><p>Google needs to do better with its charging tech, and with the Pixel 8 series going up to 27W now, that should have been the case with the Pixel 8a as well — 18W charging just isn&apos;t enough in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a-cameras-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 7a: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="imgvxRR8FUb2cmw5XGDHNL" name="Google-Pixel-7a-back-08.jpg" alt="The back of the Charcoal Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imgvxRR8FUb2cmw5XGDHNL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Google isn&apos;t making too many modifications to the cameras; the Pixel 8a has the same 64MP main camera at the back alongside a 13MP wide-angle lens, and there&apos;s a 13MP camera at the front. If that sounds familiar, it&apos;s because it is the same set of sensors as the Pixel 7a.</p><p>While the camera modules haven&apos;t changed, Google continually optimizes its algorithms, and the Pixel 8a should deliver noticeable gains in this area. Cameras have always been a strong selling point for Google — particularly the Pixel A series — and the Pixel 7a is still the best phone in this regard, but with the new imaging processor in the Pixel 8a, the phone is likely to take the crown. I&apos;ll share images and side-by-side shots of both devices shortly.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a-software-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 7a: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB" name="Google-Pixel-7a-display-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 7a's vibrant, bright display showcasing the home screen with the default coral feathers wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Google guarantees seven years of software updates to the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, and it is extending that to the Pixel 8a. The phone comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box and will get seven Android OS updates, and there&apos;s no other device that comes close to it in this segment. While Samsung also has the same guarantee, it&apos;s limited to the Galaxy S23 series, and the Galaxy A35 and A55 will get four updates.</p><p>The Pixel 7a, meanwhile, will get three platform updates along with five years of security updates. I didn&apos;t think Google would extend the same guarantee as its high-end phones to the Pixel 8a, but it is absolutely the right move.</p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the Pixel 8a is getting all the AI-focused features that debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series. That includes Best Take, Audio Magic Eraser, and Magic Editor. The phone gets all the camera-focused additions as well, and that again gives it a big advantage over just about every other mid-range phone.</p><p>The software itself is clean and doesn&apos;t have any bloatware, and Google has a ton of useful features that make using its devices an absolute joy.</p>

<p>Global availability is still a bit of an issue with Pixel phones, and while that is getting better, Google just doesn&apos;t have a presence in anywhere as many markets as its rivals. The Pixel 8a is launching in 17 countries, and there isn&apos;t a lengthy wait to get your hands on the device — it&apos;s going on sale globally starting May 14.</p><p>As much as I like the Pixel 7a, the 90Hz panel and lack of a 256GB model ultimately limit the device. The Pixel 8a doesn&apos;t have these problems, and just the fact that it has a 120Hz panel makes it worthy of consideration. Yes, it has minor upgrades in all areas, but it&apos;s the screen and the seven-year update guarantee that makes the phone stand out. It is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best mid-range phone</a> you can get today. </p><p>If you need a new phone that can last the better part of a decade and takes fantastic photos and videos, the Pixel 8a is the obvious choice. Coming in at $499, it is $50 more than the Pixel 7a, but you&apos;re also getting better hardware. If you want to maximize value, I&apos;d suggest waiting until there&apos;s a good deal on the Pixel 7a. Anything in the vicinity to $300 is a terrific price for the device, and you&apos;re still getting feature-rich software and outstanding cameras.</p>

<p>Google finally unveiled the Pixel 8a this morning, and while you&apos;ll need to wait until May 14th to physically get your hands on the device, we&apos;ve already gathered some of the best Google Pixel 8a deals so you don&apos;t have to go looking. Several preorder opportunities have already become available (with plenty more on the way), so if you&apos;re looking to beat the crowds and save some cash with a hot-off-the-presses device, you&apos;ve come to the right place. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> continues the legacy of Google&apos;s midrange A series by offering some of the best specs and camera technology found in any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Android phone under $500</a> to date. You get the same Tensor G3 chipset that powers the Google Pixel 8 Pro, plus a boost in battery life, a 120Hz display, and a whopping seven years of OS upgrades guaranteed. Beyond that, not much has changed from last year&apos;s Google Pixel 7a — but perhaps that&apos;s a good thing. So how can you buy it? Is it even worth it? We&apos;ll answer all of those questions (and more) below. </p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-does-the-pixel-8a-come-out-2">When does the Pixel 8a come out?</h2>
<p>The Google Pixel 8a is set to be officially released on <strong>May 14th</strong>, the same day as the Google I/O 2024 announcement event. All of the usual retailers — Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart — will be selling the phone unlocked, or you can buy the Pixel 8a through your wireless carrier to score some additional potential savings. </p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-google-pixel-8a-cost-2">How much does the Google Pixel 8a cost?</h2>
<p>The Pixel 8a starts at $499 for the 128GB version, or you can upgrade to the 256GB storage configuration for $599. There are four color options available: Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay, and a new Aloe variety.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-google-pixel-8a-compare-to-the-pixel-7a-2">How does the Google Pixel 8a compare to the Pixel 7a?</h2>
<p>The evolution from the Pixel 7a into the 8a isn&apos;t quite as dramatic as you might have hoped. This new midrange masterpiece from Google is more about <em>refinement </em>than <em>reinvention</em>.  </p><p>Compared to its predecessor, the Pixel 8a features a new chipset straight out of the box — the Google Tensor G3 — plus you&apos;ll enjoy a boost in battery life and display quality. The Pixel 8a also comes with more software support than its predecessor. Aside from those specs, the Google Pixel 8a hasn&apos;t changed much. Since we called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> the "best Pixel Google has ever produced" almost exactly one year ago today, maybe we should appreciate the cautious approach, even if it&apos;s not particularly exciting. </p><p>That being said, if you already own the Google Pixel 7a, you can probably skip this model. </p><p>For a more comprehensive look into how these two smartphones compare, check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a">our Google Pixel 8a vs. Pixel 7a</a> guide. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s new budget-friendly Pixel 8a just dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">before the I/O 2024 event</a>, and if you&apos;re after a great mix of features and price, this might be the phone you&apos;ve been waiting for.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a looks almost identical to its pricier sibling, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. To keep up with the competition, Google threw in new features like generative AI and bigger storage capacity.</p><p>Google has also upgraded the Pixel 8a’s performance, display, and battery life, all starting at just $499. In Canada and India, its retail price starts at CA$679 and ₹52,999, respectively. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">pre-order it today</a>, and it will hit store shelves on May 14 at the Google Store and other retail partners, right alongside the newly unveiled Pixel Tablet.</p><p>The Pixel 8a runs on the same Tensor G3 chip as the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, so you&apos;ll get all the neat software features like the improved <em>Magic Eraser</em>, <em>Zoom Enhance</em>, <em>Best Take</em>, <em>Audio Magic Eraser</em>, and more. Plus, it includes the Titan M2 security chip and a built-in VPN for extra security.</p><p>For the first time, the Pixel 8a offers a larger 256GB storage option along with 8GB of RAM. It also comes in two fun new colors, Aloe (which is a limited edition) and Bay, alongside the usual Obsidian and Porcelain options.</p>

<p>Like the flagship models, the Pixel 8a features an aluminum camera bar and polished aluminum side rails. It&apos;s rated IP67 for dust and water resistance, so it can withstand slips, spills, and dust. According to Google, this makes the Pixel 8a the most durable A-Series phone to date.</p><p>The Pixel 8a keeps up the trend with a 64MP main camera, just like the previous model. It also adds a 13MP ultrawide camera and a 13MP front-facing selfie camera. All three can shoot in 4K video, hitting 60fps for the rear cameras and 30fps for selfies.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll also get all the AI-powered imaging perks like <em>Real Tone, Magic Eraser, Night Sight, Photo Unblur</em>, and more. Plus, you can zoom in super close up to 8x without losing quality, thanks to the Super Res Zoom.</p><p>Google has also confirmed that the new mid-range phone will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, making the Pixel 8a the first in its price range to have the built-in AI assistant. You&apos;ll also get other Pixel-exclusive Android features like <em>Circle to Search</em> (which is also on Samsung&apos;s recent flagship phones), <em>Pixel Call Assist</em>, and <em>Audio Emojis</em> all bundled with the handset.</p><p>Similar to the Pixel 8 series, the 8a will also benefit from seven years of updates covering OS, security, and Feature Drops. This means Pixel 8 users can anticipate updates continuing until 2031. Previously, Google provided up to three years of major Android OS upgrades and five years of security updates for the Pixel-A models.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (May 7), Google is re-introducing its Pixel Tablet as the company relaunches the device without its charging add-on for $399.</p><p>According to Google, the Pixel Tablet&apos;s relaunch saw the product launch without the charging speaker dock. The company states it has continued to "add new features" that users may find helpful for the on-the-go device and in the home. More importantly, the Pixel Tablet&apos;s relaunch brings the addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> as a convenient new tool.</p><p>The function launched in January and was first made available on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series. Circle to Search lets users launch a query into Google from anywhere on their device by highlighting, circling, scribbling, or tapping an item. Users can then write additional information to help narrow their search before beginning.</p><p>Google states Circle to Search on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> will arrive "later this month."</p><p>To make it "more accessible," the product relaunch includes the arrival of Samsung&apos;s AI assistant, Bixby.</p><p>The relaunched Pixel Tablet is still available with an 11-inch LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, compatible with USI 2.0 stylus pens. Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2">Tensor G2</a> powers its capabilities alongside the Titan M2 security chip to help protect users utilizing it. Consumers should gain at least 12 hours of video streaming from the Pixel Tablet with its 27W-hour battery.</p><p>Internally, 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB USF 3.1 internal storage is available.</p>

<p>Google adds that the tablet comes without its charging speaker dock for the first time. However, users can purchase this as an additional accessory if they wish to have one. The Pixel Tablet is available for pre-orders today (May 7) and will be available on the market on May 14. The company advises that the device is not available in Spain or Italy.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google shot down any possibility of a Pixel stylus and keyboard accompanying the product. The company stated, "At this time, we have no new accessories to announce."</p><p>Let&apos;s not forget that Google is preparing for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">annual I/O event</a> on May 14. The official market debut of the relaunched Pixel Tablet will coincide with this event, where we should learn more about upcoming Pixel products and software.</p>

<hr>
<p>For the past three years, Beat Saber players have enjoyed slicing blocks in friendly competition alongside players in the game&apos;s multiplayer mode. Beat Saber&apos;s multiplayer mode has allowed cross-platform play since the beginning, but Oculus Quest players will no longer have access to the feature as of November 2, 2024.</p><p>Developer Beat Games announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/beatsaber/status/1787468616998199770"> X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/beat-saber-multiplayer-quest-1-done/">UploadVR</a>) that they would be moving forward to "focus our development efforts on our next projects within Beat Saber." While Beat Saber&apos;s most recent updates have mainly been in the form of new music packs, it seems the developers are planning something big, possibly to coincide with the seven-year anniversary of the game next May.</p><p>Oculus Quest gamers will still be able to play Beat Saber multiplayer if they play the game on a PC using the SteamVR or Oculus Rift versions of the game.</p><p>Beat Saber has long been one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> and is consistently at the top of the best-seller lists for every VR headset in existence. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-1-end-of-new-app-support">Meta recently announced</a> that it would be phasing out the original Oculus Quest, starting with prohibiting new game development as of this month (May), while major support will be sunset for the headset this August.</p><p>The Oculus Quest has been around for five years, but it began receiving waning support from developers after the Meta Quest 2 debuted in 2020. Now that the Meta Quest 3 is out, the Meta Quest 2 is starting down the path to obsolescence, as well, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3">several 2024 VR games</a> skipping support for Meta&apos;s second-generation standalone VR headset.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple&apos;s long-awaited iPad update is here, and it brings sizeable changes to both the iPad Air and iPad Pro. I&apos;ll focus most of my attention on the iPad Pro as it has much more exciting tech, but a quick rundown of what&apos;s new with the iPad Air. The 2024 model is available in two sizes — 11-inch and 13-inch — and it comes with 128GB of storage.</p><p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-air-m1-long-term-review">iPad Air M1</a>, the 2024 iPad Air is still limited to 60Hz refresh — 120Hz is exclusive to the Pro models — but it is powered by the M2 chipset, delivering much better performance. A key difference is that the camera is now located on the leading edge, which is where it should have been all along. The 11-inch iPad Air starts off at $599, with the 13-inch model now available for $799. Configuration options go up to 1TB.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w6bYaCGBNZmb9icpVNBaTH" name="ipad-pro-2024.jpg" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w6bYaCGBNZmb9icpVNBaTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPad Pro has all the latest tech, including an Ultra Retina XDR screen. The tablet is available in 11-inch and 13-inch variants, and both models have 120Hz OLED panels that hit 1,000 nits in SDR and HDR modes, going up to 1,600 nits. The iPad Pro uses a tandem OLED — similar to that of the Honor&apos;s Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR — to deliver increased brightness and panel longevity, and there&apos;s an optional nano-texture glass coating that reduces glare.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot to like on the design front as well. The 11-inch iPad Air comes in at just 5.3mm, and the 13-inch model has a thickness of just 5.1mm, making it the thinnest Apple product to date — it&apos;s thinner than the iPad Nano. They&apos;re lighter as well, and are touted to have better durability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yy8eaWjgfdLH2qtwhpnNFH" name="ipad-pro-2024-2.jpg" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yy8eaWjgfdLH2qtwhpnNFH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To accommodate the svelte designs, Apple is introducing a new Magic Keyboard that has an aluminum palm rest. It gets a function row, and the standout feature is a haptic trackpad that should deliver much better feedback. The Magic Keyboard costs $299 for the 11-inch variant, and $399 for the 13-inch option.</p><p>Powering the iPad Pro is the brand-new M4 silicon. It is 50% faster than the M2 in the last-gen iPad Pro, and that is just a massive gain in performance between generations. The M4 also gets dynamic caching, ray tracing, and mesh shading, and is 4x faster than the M2 at rendering tasks. The new 16-core neural engine is able to hit 38 TOPS, and that is just in a league of its own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V6zvWeaWwDiZCCb438K4eH" name="ipad-pro-2024-4.jpg" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V6zvWeaWwDiZCCb438K4eH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The M4 also gets AV1 decode, and it has a memory bandwidth of 120GB/s, making it a terrific choice for gaming. To round things out, there&apos;s better thermal management, and the M4 should deliver noticeable efficiency gains as it is built on a second-gen 3nm node.</p><p>Finally, there&apos;s a new Apple Pencil Pro that costs $129. It has sensors in the barrel that unlocks a squeeze gesture to pull up menus, and there&apos;s a haptic motor integrated into the design. The Pencil Pro can be used with both the iPad Pro and iPad Air models.</p><p>The 11-inch iPad Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro">starts off at $999</a>, with the 13-inch model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro">debuting at $1,299</a>. Both variants get 256GB of storage as standard, and they go up to 2TB. They&apos;re available to pre-order right now, with sales starting May 15. The 2022 iPad Pro is still going strong, and the new additions to the M4-based iPad Pro gives it a distinct edge. The OLED panel in combination with the new design makes the iPad Pro that much more enticing, and as someone who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/ipad-pro-2022-productivity">uses the iPad Pro a lot</a>, I can&apos;t wait to get stared with the 2024 variant.</p>

<ul><li>A so-called "magic button" has been rumored to be in the works for a Google TV remote since 2020, and it can be custom-mapped to a specific action.</li><li>Rumors intensified late last year, when traces of the new button and remote appeared in the Android TV 14 Beta. </li><li>Now, the button finally arrived on Walmart's new Onn 4K Pro streaming box, which uses Google TV.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-new-remote-leak">rumors and leaks</a> that Google worked on a customizable Google TV remote button for years, but now it is finally debuting on a streaming box. However, it isn&apos;t a new Chromecast. Though there are reports that a refreshed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast with Google TV 4K</a> is on the way, the so-called "magic" button launched first on Walmart&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/4K-Pro-Streaming-Device/5193222892?clickid=UUOXIMSC3xyPUdozHuXHyTVsUkHQ0L3RUQSvXw0&irgwc=1&sourceid=imp_UUOXIMSC3xyPUdozHuXHyTVsUkHQ0L3RUQSvXw0&veh=aff&wmlspartner=imp_3690421&affiliates_ad_id=565706&campaign_id=9383&sharedid=" target="_blank">Onn 4K Pro Streaming Device</a>. It&apos;s an improved Onn streaming box that retails for $50, includes an Ethernet jack, and features a refreshed remote. </p><p>Now that the Onn 4K Pro Streaming Device is starting to hit the hands of early buyers, we&apos;re learning more about the magic button and its capabilities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aftvnews.com/google-tvs-new-magic-star-button-can-launch-any-app-or-change-tv-input-available-first-on-the-onn-4k-pro-remote/" target="_blank">AFTVNews</a> got one of the earliest units, pulling the curtain behind the custom button, which is shaped like a star. On the Google TV remote for the Onn 4K Pro Streaming Device, this star button lives right across from the power button at the top of the remote. </p><p>The first time you press the star button on a Google TV remote that includes it, a new screen will appear in Google&apos;s TV OS. "You can press the [star] button to open a favorite TV app or perform an action," the prompt explains. "Choose the type of shortcut below."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hyEYERpjBU979mhpVGZATS" name="Google-TV-Shortcut.jpg" alt="The button-mapping screen for the Google TV star button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyEYERpjBU979mhpVGZATS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AFTVNews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, the star button appears to have only two options: You can map it to open an app of your choosing or have it switch device inputs on your TV. Based on Google&apos;s wording, however, more uses for the star button may come in the future. If you want to change its function after the initial setup process, you can do so in settings. Additionally, holding the star button will let you pick a new app assignment for it from anywhere.</p><p>To find settings related to customizable buttons on Google TV devices, you can navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Remote</strong> > <strong>Setup remote buttons</strong> > <strong>Customizable button</strong>.</p><p>While the star button is only available on the Onn 4K Pro for now, it would seem to be a lock for inclusion on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-successor-may-come-soon-new-remote">rumored upcoming Chromecast with Google TV 4K refresh</a>. </p><p>The star button isn&apos;t the only new one to appear on the Onn 4K Pro Streaming Device, either. There&apos;s also a massive "Free TV" button accentuated by a bright blue color. It&apos;s another differentiating factor for the Onn 4K Pro, which costs exactly the same as the regular Chromecast with Google TV 4K. You can buy the Onn 4K Pro starting now from Walmart&apos;s online store, but there appears to be limited or no in-store availability at the moment. </p>
