<ul><li>Your first Samsung Galaxy Watch might be unable to install apps next year.</li><li>TizenOS support clarified upcoming changes coming to the operating system from next year to a Reddit user.</li><li>The first changes will occur in September this year, and all TizenOS-powered smartwatches will be affected.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s first Galaxy Watch shipped with Tizen OS, followed by the next batch of Samsung smartwatches featuring the same operating system. It&apos;s been a while since Samsung cared about the Tizen OS — as most new ones come with WearOS. The Korean tech giant looks like it is officially pulling the plug next year.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1d4m0z7/samsung_is_dropping_galaxy_store_support_for/">Reddit user</a> who interacted with Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Store Operations team (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-tizen-smartwatches-galaxy-store-termination-schedule-3447771/">Android Authority</a>) revealed some interesting details about the Tizen OS and its future support for Galaxy Watches released before the Watch 4 series. Predominantly, Tizen service "will only be available until September 2025," the team noted, citing Galaxy Store&apos;s policy.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1d4m0z7/samsung_is_dropping_galaxy_store_support_for">Samsung is dropping Galaxy Store support for Tizen Watches </a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch">r/GalaxyWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Currently, Tizen OS-powered smartwatches released by Samsung include the Galaxy Watch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review">Galaxy Watch 3</a>, Active 1, Active 2, Gear, and others launched before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> series — all the aforementioned will be the primary devices losing support in phases. Starting September 30, the Galaxy Store won&apos;t provide paid Tizen watch content.</p><p>Secondly, Tizen OS users cannot download new watch content from the Galaxy Store after May 31, 2025, while the already downloaded apps "will still be available" unless users delete them from their smartwatch. If the users delete them, they won&apos;t be available to re-download after September 30, 2025.</p>

<p>Per the publication, the Tizen developer portal also no longer allows new Tizen watch apps or updates. Despite a successful run of Tizen OS with the first Galaxy Watch and the succeeding models until the Galaxy Watch 3, Samsung chose to shift to WearOS since the Galaxy Watch 4. Hence, Samsung&apos;s ending support for Tizen OS is an expected move. </p><p>However, users of the earlier Galaxy Watch models may have to settle for the current and upcoming versions from Samsung, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series, which is anticipated to launch alongside the foldable phones in July. Alternatively, users can continue to use the services through the next year; as Samsung notes, "core services related to this watch will stop everywhere except Galaxy Store after May 2025." In that case, they can look for an upgrade.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that Samsung is unlikely to shut down Tizen entirely as the company still runs the Tizen operating system on some of the Smart TVs available in the market.</p>

<p>Enabot never lets us down with its quirky smart robots. The brand&apos;s products are designed to be pet companions but also home security cameras at the same time. Combining several functions into one capable product makes a lot of sense and also maximizes value for money.</p><p>More than anything, though, Enabot&apos;s pet robot pals have a fun personality and that&apos;s what gives them life. It makes robots like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smart-home/enabot-ebo-air-review">EBO Air</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/enabot-ebo-x-review">EBO X</a> fun to use. The addition of wheels is what really sets these smart cameras apart from the overcrowded sea of smart home surveillance gear available. You can move your Enabot robot around the house from anywhere in the world, as long as your phone has internet connectivity.</p><p>Enabot has added a new member to its family, introducing the RolaPet PetPal to the brand&apos;s smart robot lineup earlier this year. What makes the newest member so different is that it is shaped more like a robot vacuum rather than the round Enabot pet pals of the past. Needless to say, I was intrigued and decided to go hands-on with the device.</p>

<p>Enabot launched the RolaPet PetPal on March 21, 2024, along with two modular extensions for the robot that can be bought separately, as well as a cloud subscription service. The Cloud+ Subscription service gives you access to 24/7 cloud playback, smart alerts, and daily pet vlogs. It doesn&apos;t take away much from the experience if you don&apos;t get the subscription since there&apos;s local storage and the option to store images and videos on your phone. But you definitely need the extensions to tap into the robot&apos;s full potential.</p><p>Setting up the RolaPet PetPal is extremely simple. It hardly took me ten minutes to set it up, including downloading and logging in to the RolaPet app. I don&apos;t know why Enabot creates a whole new app for every robot. At this point, I have three different Enabot apps on my phone.</p>

<p>The app itself is user-friendly and pretty straightforward. You can control two-way comms with it, make the RolaPet PetPal play tricks, toggle night mode, automatically play tag with your pet, set it to randomly shoot pictures, or do a host of other things. The "head" bit on top of the 2.5K QHD camera unit is also a big button, and every time your cat or dog taps it, they can give you a call on your phone.</p><p>I love, love, love the fact that Enabot brought back the cutesy sounds of the robot. Everything from it saying its own name, uttering "pew pew", or screaming "ouch" when it bumps into obstacles is hilarious. The playful moves that were missing on the EBO X are back, although there&apos;s no Alexa integration. I can live with that — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-speaker">Alexa speakers</a> don&apos;t cost much anyway.</p><p>Each of the modular extensions for the RolaPet PetPal unlocks different options in-app. There are two extensions that you can swap out the basic storage unit with: a treat dispenser and interactive toys. By the way, switching the extensions takes just a few seconds of your time.</p>

<p>Enabot did a very good job with the RolaPet PetPal, and there&apos;s one extremely enticing feature about the smart home camera: the price. Following up after the thousand-dollar EBO X, this thing only costs about $230.</p><p>It would be an unbeatable bargain if it weren&apos;t for the add-ons that cost $50 apiece. That&apos;s darn expensive for modular extensions meant to do one or two functions each. Luckily, you can get a bundle deal with everything included for about $300. If you&apos;re interested in buying this robot, I&apos;d suggest the bundle deal.</p>

<p>While I am very happy with the Enabot RolaPet PetPal, there are a few downgrades to consider. I won&apos;t compare it to the EBO X because they&apos;re just very different kinds of products. Looking at just the RolaPet PetPal on its own, it has room for improvement based on my testing.</p><p>Firstly, Enabot really needs to fix the robot&apos;s charging station positioning software. It took nearly an hour for the Enabot RolaPet PetPal to go back to its charging station. Actually, it never made it back a couple of times. Those times, I got tired of hearing it bumping and sighing and just ended up putting it back at its station manually.</p><p>Another big problem with the RolaPet PetPal is that its controls are not as smooth as some of Enabot&apos;s other smart cameras on wheels. Its movements are jerky and sometimes feel choppy when being controlled manually via the RolaPet app. I checked my internet connection just to make sure that wasn&apos;t the issue, and it wasn&apos;t it. Hopefully, a firmware update can fix these issues.</p><p>Lastly, I have a bone to pick with the basic Enabot RolaPet PetPal attachment that you get out of the box. It has no practical use at all. The compartment is basically a storage box with no functions or features. Why bother including it at all? Enabot could just give users the option to buy the RolaPet PetPal with a treat dispenser or toy add-on instead of the stupid storage extension. It feels like a shameless money grab.</p><p>Enabot has promised more modular extensions down the line and I&apos;m excited to see what they deliver. The robot&apos;s self-charging function is essential for a camera-on-wheels and the feeding compartment is a game changer. You can literally chase your pets from outside the house and feed them at will. If you&apos;re into robots and leave your pets at home for extended periods, the Enabot RolaPet PetPal is a fun and useful smart camera to have.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>My experience began in a snowy mountainscape as a small avalanche of bricks landed right in front of me. It immediately informed me that I could expect danger around any corner, and even going in with the idea that I thought I knew what I was in for, I never expected to feel the scale that was about to await me.</p><p>Behemoth is every bit Shadow of the Colossus as you would expect if you know anything about the game&apos;s premise. Climbing a colossus of an enemy is satisfying in a unique way that only such a feat could possess. I only fought one Behemoth in my nearly hour-long demo on PSVR 2 but was told it was the <em>smallest</em> Behemoth in the game — something I didn&apos;t quite expect, given that it was as tall as a five-story building.</p><p>The game&apos;s developer aims to deliver a satisfying action-adventure game, and while it borrows some key mechanics from the team&apos;s previous two Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners games, it stands on its own in look and feel.</p><p>In fact, while it shares some of the same stamina, health, and weapons physics ideas as those two Walking Dead games, the team had to rebuild everything from scratch because it&apos;s developed in Unreal Engine 5. That allowed them to rethink how they want Behemoth to feel instead of just feeling like another Walking Dead game set in a snowy landscape, and boy does it ever seem to deliver.</p>
<h2 id="action-at-the-forefront-2">Action at the forefront</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UkjPwMh6VnPTbfrXTZFwaZ" name="behemoth-vr-official-screenshot-giant.jpg" alt="Approaching a giant in an official screenshot from Behemoth running on PSVR 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkjPwMh6VnPTbfrXTZFwaZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While The Walking Dead S&S games were both survival sandbox titles, Behemoth aims to be a much more straightforward game. Like the team&apos;s previous games, levels are visited via a home hub where players can use the experience they&apos;ve earned to upgrade weapons via skill trees and craft important healing items for missions. Unlike The Walking Dead, however, players shouldn&apos;t expect dozens of crafting recipes or a collectathon.</p><p>Rather, crafting is devised as a way to use herbs and other scarce small items you&apos;ll find along the way, limiting your ability to heal and challenging your strategic skills. You&apos;ll find save points along the way through each of the game&apos;s twelve levels - each level culminating in a Behemoth to fight - and some of these act as Dark Souls-esque campfire warp points. But there&apos;s no weapon durability factor that&apos;ll see you breaking weapons during battle or needing to constantly craft new ones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WGtJEqb34DwLJrPEZHjzpY" name="behemoth-vr-official-screenshot-enemies.jpg" alt="Attacking enemies in an official screenshot from Behemoth running on PSVR 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGtJEqb34DwLJrPEZHjzpY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, the game lets you take weapons and shields off any enemy you dispatch along the way, and there are plenty of them to find. There&apos;s not even a complicated inventory system like you&apos;ll find in TWD S&S. You&apos;ll still drop herbs and other collectables into a pouch on your back, but you won&apos;t be reaching over your shoulder to check your inventory at any time.</p><p>Rather, a single slot at the front of your belt will grant you healing items as you need them — so long as you have some in your inventory, of course — and four weapon slots on your body make it easy to quickly swap between your favorites.</p><p>During the hands-on, I found it easy to juggle several types of weapons, although I found myself using a bow on the left slot on my back, the hero sword on the right back slot, a shield on the left of my belt, and an axe on the right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7UHMyvxNPcc8zNvA9dVwrZ" name="behemoth-vr-official-screenshot-katana.jpg" alt="Using a golden katana in an official screenshot from Behemoth running on PSVR 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7UHMyvxNPcc8zNvA9dVwrZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Weapons all have various specializations that come in handy. An axe will shred wooden shields without effort, while a sword might be handy for stabbing into a particularly defense-heavy enemy.</p><p>The physics-based combat system felt great, and while it&apos;s similar to games like Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 and Until You Fall, I found that it wasn&apos;t as obvious with giving you visual cues as some other more hand-holding titles are.</p><p>Many combat situations will see you blocking and parrying attacks, but you can also use a variety of environmental hazards to dispatch your foes. All of the traps I found were activated with the grappling hook on your left wrist, which is shot by aiming and pressing the trigger.</p><p>Once the grappling hook sinks its teeth into a target, you can grab it and reel it in or yank it in one direction to activate it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfnnSQzVdQdqaMukCcfkMZ" name="behemoth-vr-official-screenshot-grapple-hook.jpg" alt="Using the grapple hook in an official screenshot from Behemoth running on PSVR 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfnnSQzVdQdqaMukCcfkMZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These types of environmental hazards are present throughout the entire level but vary in their scope and style. One trap was a scraggly old tree that I could pull down, and activating your superhuman strength — done by pressing two specific buttons at the same time — will allow you to whip it in any direction you want.</p><p>Likewise, activating your superhuman strength will let you cleave enemies in two, either by throwing weapons at them or in melee combat.</p><p>The grappling hook also comes in handy for climbing, and just as in Horizon Call of the Mountain, it’s likely you’ll be doing a lot of climbing in this game. Of course, climbing living Behemoths is a little different from just rappelling up the side of a mountain, which is at the heart of what makes the game extra special.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll play through the eyes of Wren, a purposefully chosen androgynous name that allows each player to select from a vision of what they might expect the character to look and sound like as they attempt to take on twelve giants - or Behemoths - who have brought a terrible curse to the land.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, it&apos;s not just your spouse and children or your village mates that are afflicted. Wren is also afflicted by the curse and is fighting against time to rid the land of these Behemoths, as it’s thought that eliminating them will rid the land of the curse.</p><p>As I battled my way through the single level I played — one that won’t be in the final game, I’m told — it culminated in fighting the massive Behemoth previously described. While this particular Behemoth didn’t require me to climb its entire mass in order to slay it, there were key times throughout the battle when I was given the opportunity to climb its legs to deal critical damage.</p>

<p>Defeating the Behemoth required me to eventually use an environmental hazard to weaken it enough to climb up to its head, and from there, I could tear out its essence and remove it from existence.</p><p>When the final game comes out, defeating Behemoths will give you a boost to your HP, stamina, and other factors, but there’s no specific leveling system to get tangled up in.</p><p>Players that enjoy more endless waves of combat can jump into the game’s “Combat Gym” mode that tosses enemies at you in waves, giving you the ability to use each arena’s special traps and weapons to your heart’s content.</p><p>Behemoth launches on Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, PSVR 2, and Steam VR later this year at a currently undisclosed price. The game’s lead developer, Skydance Games, told me the team is hoping to add to the world of Behemoth over time, but there are currently no concrete dates for DLC or anything like that.</p><p>As it stands, Behemoth looks to be one of the VR behemoths releasing later this year and should give gamers a good excuse to don their VR headsets more often.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify is raising the prices of Spotify Premium for the second time in as many years.</li><li>The new price for the Individual plan is $11.99, which is a dollar increase, while Spotify Premium Duo and Spotify Premium Family see larger increases.</li><li>This year's price hikes are controversial due to Spotify's recent axing of Car Thing support and the company's inability to ship high-res audio support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In the early days of streaming, price increases were few and far between, but they&apos;re now more like an annual occurrence. Sure enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> announced Monday (June 3) that it would raise Spotify Premium prices for the second time in as many years. As a result of the change, Spotify Premium will cost more than its two main competitors, Apple Music and Tidal. The price hikes cover all Spotify Premium tiers, excluding the discounted student rate. </p><p>Spotify announced the move in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pr-newsroom-wp.appspot.com/2024-06-03/adjusting-spotify-premium-prices-in-the-us/" target="_blank">press release</a>, as well as in an email to subscribers. "So that we can continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience, we occasionally update our prices," the company said. "Over the next month, subscribers in the U.S. will receive an email (pictured below) explaining what this update means for their subscription."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.50%;"><img id="MRajjiPZbimH2MtfUeA7TG" name="Email-Screenshot.jpg" alt="The email from Spotify to users about a price hike." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MRajjiPZbimH2MtfUeA7TG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="396" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The price for a Premium Individual plan is now $11.99, which is a dollar more than the old rate and a dollar above the comparable Apple Music and Tidal plans. Spotify Premium Duo is up by $2 and costs $16.99—the old price of the Spotify Premium Family plan. Premium Family will now cost $19.99, a $3 increase. These numbers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-price-increase-new-plans-claims">match an April report</a> that speculated a price hike was coming. </p><p>New subscribers can join Spotify Premium starting today at the updated subscription costs. Current members will see the new Premium prices in effect when their plan renews next month. People on a free trial will get one month of Premium at the old prices and will be switched over to the new rates after their first paid month ends. </p><p>The updated prices are being rolled out nearly a year after Spotify&apos;s last price hike, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-to-bump-up-its-premium-pricing">which was in July 2023</a>. Spotify had never increased Premium prices before last year. Now, it has done so every year, back to back. This is a worrying trend, and it could push Spotify listeners to pursue other means of music consumption. </p>
<h2 id="no-price-increase-is-fun-but-this-one-is-particularly-bad-2">No price increase is fun, but this one is particularly bad</h2>

<p>No one likes paying more for the same experience. Spotify says the price hikes help the company "invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience." But the bottom line is that Spotify Premium users who subscribe today will get the exact same experience as those who subscribed yesterday, despite paying more. If Spotify did add new features, who knows if users would even want them or if they&apos;d be worth the extra monthly fee?</p><p>However, another reason this year&apos;s Spotify price hikes are egregious is the state of high-resolution audio on the platform. Apple Music and Tidal have made lossless audio available on their platforms for literal years. Spotify announced Hi-Fi in early 2021 and, at the time, said it would ship later that year. Three years removed from the initial Hi-Fi announcement, and the feature is nowhere to be found. </p><p>Apple Music and Tidal have integrated high-res audio into their standard streaming services at no additional cost, so it&apos;s safe to call hi-fi an essential feature for a music streamer in 2024. Now that Spotify&apos;s prices are going up, Spotify Premium will cost more than Apple Music and Tidal. That&apos;s absolutely outlandish, considering Spotify is so far behind in audio quality. </p><p>To make matters worse, Spotify is looking to lock Hi-Fi behind a separate paywall, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-lossless-audio-expectation-leak">according to leaks</a>. It&apos;s a perplexing strategy, especially since Tidal recently <em>lowered </em>prices, seemingly acknowledging that users aren&apos;t willing to pay more for higher-quality audio. Spotify Premium is more expensive across the board, which means the upcoming "Enhanced Listening" tier will cost more than these fresh prices. So, Spotify is charging more than industry competitors despite being unable to keep up in functionality.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QPMaSwHCGXjqqiQ8QxLQab" name="Spotify-Car-Thing-dial.jpg" alt="Turning the dial on Spotify Car Thing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QPMaSwHCGXjqqiQ8QxLQab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The elephant in the room is certainly Spotify&apos;s discontinuation of Car Thing, its $90 hardware interface. The company announced last month that it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-kills-car-thing">brick every Car Thing device it ever sold</a> in December, and initially denied refunds. Late last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-is-offering-refunds-for-car-thing-before-it-stops-working">it reversed course and offered refunds</a> through Spotify&apos;s customer service channels.</p><p>The optics of the situation are certainly interesting. Spotify says it can&apos;t support a hardware product it sold just a few years ago anymore, then has a change of heart and offers refunds, and finally hikes subscription prices. Are these incidents related? Probably not, but it&apos;s still a bad look. People already have a sour taste in their mouth from the Car Thing incident, and although Spotify did end up making it right, the subscription hike basically negates any goodwill earned. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sXCYTsQwrLmidXgZQ9YT4U" name="fiio-jt1-3.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sXCYTsQwrLmidXgZQ9YT4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Streaming became an alternative to buying music, and on the TV side of things, as an alternative to cable. But the prices of TV streaming services and the amount of them needed to watch what you want are causing some users to return to cable. In some cases, it&apos;s now cheaper to pay for cable instead of paying for an arsenal of TV streaming services. Could something similar happen to music streaming? If the situation continues to worsen and prices continue to rise, could listeners return to old habits?</p><p>The simple answer is probably not. Streaming is still a really enticing proposition, as you can listen to as much as you want for a flat monthly rate. However, there have been bumps in the road for music streaming. Prices aren&apos;t as favorable as they once were, and Spotify&apos;s moves might signal yearly price hikes — or at least more frequent ones. There are other issues with streaming, too, like needing a network connection to validate your subscription, restrictive DRM, and licensing scuffles between artists, labels, and streamers that only hurt users.</p><p>With all those downsides in mind, I&apos;m strongly considering leaving streaming behind. When you stream music, you don&apos;t own anything. The second you cancel your subscription, you&apos;re unable to access music, even if you&apos;ve paid hundreds over the years for a membership. That money might be better put toward owning music for yourself, which lasts forever. I have songs purchased more than two decades ago on iTunes and physical media created before I was born. </p><p>Ownership is an underrated thing in music. Sure, you&apos;ll probably pay more, but a greater portion of that money will actually make its way to your favorite artists. If you&apos;re absolutely opposed to buying music, you might not have to. Nearly all public libraries have CDs, and it&apos;s perfectly legal to get MP3s from them for personal use. </p><p>In a perfect world, streaming is the final form of music listening. You&apos;d have access to virtually any song out there for a flat monthly rate. The reality, however, is much different. The price hikes for music streaming services are just one of the reasons I&apos;m considering a switch to true music ownership instead.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola just launched its new Edge (2024) midrange device today (June 4), built to "empower" consumers on a daily basis.</p><p>According to its press release, the Motorola Edge (2024) offers a 6.6-inch pOLED endless edge display with a quick 144Hz refresh rate. Motorola has continued to feature a 360Hz refresh touch rate on its new Edge to ensure users experience a fast, responsive phone.</p><p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-motorola-edge-gen-4/p?skuId=1001">its 2022 iteration</a>, the Moto Edge offers a raised, rectangular dual-camera array. The post highlights a 50MP primary lens that leverages Sony&apos;s LYT-700C imaging sensor with f/1.8 aperture. Joining it will be a 13MP ultra-wide lens able to achieve a 120-degree field-of-view. The front-facing camera comes in at 32MP with auto-focus (AF).</p><p>Motorola explains that its rear camera offers several features such as Panorama, Night Vision, Dual Capture, Ultra-res, and more. Other capabilities, courtesy of AI software, include Google Auto Enhance, Auto Smile Capture, and Google Lens integration, among others.</p><p>For video capture, the 50MP primary lens can capture your memories at 4K UHD quality at 30fps. Swapping to FHD will award you 60fps capture, alongside an option for 30fps.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s midrange Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 SoC will power the 2024 Moto Edge&apos;s capabilities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="jWjo2Pjj3gEcsfXsYyn4kL" name="motorola-edge-2024-held-sideways.jpg" alt="The Motorola Edge 2024 held sideways." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWjo2Pjj3gEcsfXsYyn4kL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4752" height="3168" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Feature-wise, Motorola states the 2024 Edge delivers a new "Quick Button" on the side of the device. The purpose is so users can launch their favorite apps quickly without much hassle, as well as an "app-specific action." Motorola adds users can attach a messaging app, social media app, or anything else to this new Quick Button for easy access.</p><p>Carrying you throughout the day will be the Edge&apos;s 5,000mAh battery, which is a notable upgrade from the 4,400mAh battery that the 2023 iteration offers. Paired with this is 68W wired TurboPower charging. Motorola states this technology will give consumers around 50% in just 15 minutes. Additionally, there&apos;s a 15W wireless charging option.</p><p>The post states the Moto Edge 2024 contains 256GB of internal storage and RAM Boost for turning unused storage into "virtual" RAM.</p>

<p>The phone has an IP68 rating for dust, dirt, and sand resistance. Motorola&apos;s Edge can survive for nearly thirty minutes when submerged in 1.5 meters of water. Moreover, the device (back panel) is featured in Midnight Blue vegan leather for a premium feel without breaking the bank.</p><p>Motorola states that the 2024 Edge will be available on June 20 for $549. Consumers can find it in the U.S. at Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola.com. Networks like T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Spectrum, Consumer Cellular, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, and Visible will also carry the device.</p><p>Those in Canada can expect to find the Moto Edge 2024 "in the coming months."</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is suing Oura in U.S. District Court to forestall any patent claims against the Samsung Galaxy Ring. </li><li>Oura has previously sued Circular, RingConn, and Ultrahuman for patent infringement and owns over 100 smart ring patents.</li><li>Samsung claims its Galaxy Ring doesn't infringe on Oura's patents and is seeking legal confirmation before its August release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>On May 30, Samsung lawyers filed a lawsuit in the San Francisco Division District Court against Oura Health Oy, asking for a declaratory judgment and jury trial. Why? Because they think Oura will sue Samsung over the Galaxy Ring — just like it sued three other smart ring makers — and want to establish legal innocence before the smart ring goes on sale.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.430276/gov.uscourts.cand.430276.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">lawsuit documents</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170479/samsung-galaxy-ring-oura-lawsuit-smart-ring-patents" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) reveal that Samsung intends to send the Galaxy Ring into mass production in "mid-June 2024" and will open smart ring sales "in or around August 2024." Samsung has long hinted at a summer Galaxy Unpacked reveal, but this is the first <em>official</em> confirmation.</p><p>Samsung claims that "Oura&apos;s pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors in the smart ring market" is an "actual, imminent risk to Samsung" and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>&apos;s chances of success.</p><p>The filing then runs through Oura&apos;s history of suing three other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-smart-rings-work">smart ring</a> makers over alleged patent infringement: Circular, Ultrahuman, and RingConn. In one case, Oura "alleged infringement by Circular and then filed suit against Circular before obtaining a sample of the Circular Ring," months before it went on sale. Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-files-itc-action-for-patent-infringement/" target="_blank">filed a joint ITC action against these three brands</a> in March 2024, and the case is ongoing. </p><p>Samsung fears Oura might target them next in the lead-up to the August launch, triggering bad press and stalled sales for a major new product. </p>

<p>When Samsung first announced the Galaxy Ring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-responds-galaxy-ring-announcement">Oura responded</a> by touting its "strongest IP portfolio—in both hardware and software—for the smart ring form factor, with 100 granted patents, 270 pending patent applications, and 130+ registered trademarks." </p><p>Samsung references this announcement directly in the lawsuit, along with several interviews where Oura CEO Tom Hale repeatedly mentioned his company&apos;s readiness to "defend [its] intellectual property" and praised Masimo, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/masimo-ceo-claims-the-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensors-are-inaccurate-and-that-users-will-be-better-off-without-them">sued Apple over its SpO2 technology</a> and argued for an Apple Watch ban. </p><p>The rest of the lawsuit walks a delicate line. Samsung first states that Oura sues companies over "features common to virtually all smart rings, such as the inclusion of sensors, electronics, and batteries." Despite this, Samsung then claims that "the Galaxy Ring has not infringed, and does not infringe, directly or indirectly, any valid and enforceable claim" from Oura&apos;s five most commonly cited patents in its previous lawsuits.</p><p>To summarize, Samsung thinks it&apos;s unfair for Oura to weaponize smart ring patents for fundamental features. At the same time, Samsung argues that its unique Galaxy Ring designs are distinct enough from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring (Gen 3)</a> that Oura can&apos;t claim they&apos;re stolen. </p><p>We don&apos;t expect this lawsuit to be resolved before the August Galaxy Ring launch, but the outcome could have far-reaching implications for the future of smart ring competition. </p>
<h2 id="the-samsung-vs-oura-legal-battle-isn-apos-t-just-about-the-galaxy-ring-2">The Samsung vs. Oura legal battle isn&apos;t just about the Galaxy Ring</h2>
<p>Back in January, I wrote a column listing the reasons <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-has-huge-potential-but-also-huge-roadblocks">why the Galaxy Ring is exciting, and why it might fail</a>. One key roadblock to its success? As I said then, Oura was "weaponizing its patents" against smart ring makers; I argued that "Oura&apos;s lawyers are poised to strike if Samsung comes anywhere close to its hundreds of patented smart ring designs."</p><p>I&apos;d say, "I&apos;d told you so," but I won&apos;t claim to be some prescient tech oracle. I didn&apos;t need to watch Oura&apos;s CEO bring up IP over and over to know what was coming. Its legal history made it plain that Oura didn&apos;t intend to let Samsung encroach on its territory, even if it <em>claimed</em> that "new players" like Samsung provided "validation" for smart rings.</p><p>I expected Oura to launch its patent salvo first; I didn&apos;t realize that Samsung&apos;s legal team wouldn&apos;t leave anything to chance. </p><p>Still, I find the Samsung vs. Oura smart ring battle fascinating. Samsung is a Goliath of the tech world and the furthest thing from an underdog. But in the smart ring space, Oura is trying to knock out competitors one by one as they arise, like a litigious game of Whack-a-Mole. </p>

<p>If Samsung convinces the U.S. District Court that it hasn&apos;t infringed on Oura, then it has the resources to become a major player in the smart ring space — if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-working-on-supporting-galaxy-ring-on-non-galaxy-phones">only for Android users</a>. More importantly (to me), this case could establish a precedent for other smart ring brands (with less robust legal teams) to argue that Oura&apos;s patents shouldn&apos;t apply to them, either.</p><p>If Oura beats Samsung, I wonder whether companies would see that as a sign to give up on smart ring development since Oura&apos;s hundreds of patents would preclude a smart ring design that <em>doesn&apos;t</em> infringe on their IP. </p><p>I don&apos;t want to vilify Oura for having the foresight to patent universal smart ring ideas before its rivals. It&apos;s not a "patent troll," but rather someone actually putting its ideas into practice with a popular consumer product. The legal merit should depend on whether Samsung infringed on Oura, not Oura&apos;s ruthless legal strategy. </p><p>But that doesn&apos;t change the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-will-stay-niche-until-missing-features-added">smart rings will remain niche</a> if only one company can legally make them with core smart features. Monopolies don&apos;t typically lead to innovation.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Leaked images reveal a significant design shift for the Galaxy Z Fold 6, moving away from curved edges to a flatter, sharper look.</li><li>The phone is rumored to have a wider cover screen and potentially wider overall dimensions when unfolded.</li><li>The internal display bezels might be squared off to match the new design.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Anticipation for the next iteration of Samsung&apos;s book-style foldable flagship, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, grows as a purported dummy unit surfaces online, offering a better look at its design.</p><p>Leaked images have surfaced on X, courtesy of @ta__tech, showing a dummy unit of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-dummy-unit-boxy-design/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Found in a Korean Forum, apparently this is the Galaxy Z Fold 6.

<p>These mock phones, often called "dummy units," are sent out to accessory companies before the real product launches to help them ensure their cases will fit the new phone perfectly.</p><p>Samsung has been tweaking the design of its Galaxy Z Fold phones for years, but it looks like the next one is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-galaxy-z-fold-6-leak-reveals-the-foldable-from-the-front">ditching the curves for a flatter, sharper look</a>.</p><p>A cursory examination of the new leak reveals a striking departure from the Galaxy Z Fold series&apos; established design paradigm. The previously ubiquitous rounded corners may be replaced with a decidedly angular aesthetic, hinting at a potential shift towards a more modern and assertive stylistic direction.</p>

<p>These leaked images aren&apos;t showing a perfect right angle; there&apos;s still a bit of a curve. But it&apos;s definitely sharper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5">Z Fold 5</a>&apos;s corners. It looks like earlier rumors about a boxier Z Fold 6 were right on the money.</p><p>Beyond the aforementioned angular shift, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-likely-to-opt-for-wider-cover-screen">noteworthy design alteration appears to be implemented in the cover screen</a>. As per the leak, the cover screen appears to be wider and looks like a regular phone screen when folded. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> usually have tall and skinny cover screens, but the Z Fold 6 might be changing that.</p><p>The internal screen isn&apos;t escaping the makeover either. The leak suggests the sides are getting squared off to match the new design, and it might be wider and shorter overall. This makes sense considering rumors say the unfolded phone will be 153.5mm x 132.5mm.</p><p>The dummy unit doesn&apos;t even try to hide the crease down the middle, which is pretty much a given for foldable phones.</p><p>Intriguingly, the hinge mechanism appears remarkably inconspicuous in the leaked imagery. This suggests that Samsung might have shrunk it down, which could make the whole phone look sleeker.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is rumored to launch alongside the Z Flip 6 and maybe even a new wearable device called the Galaxy Ring at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-event-date-rumored">Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked event on July 10</a>. That&apos;s when we should get all the official details on these new devices.</p>

<p>OnePlus isn&apos;t expected to debut its next flagship phone for a while, but that&apos;s not stopping these rumors from speculating on what we might see.</p><p>Rumors stem from notable Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OgG18rs6V?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) on Weibo, which states the OnePlus 13 could miss out on wireless charging (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/06/oneplus-13-may-not-include-wireless-charging-details-tipped.html">Android Headlines</a>). The device may sport a 6,000mAh battery, backed by 100W wired charging. Additionally, as previously rumored, the OnePlus 13 will likely gain strength from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-power-hungry-rumor">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>.</p><p>The leaks continue as DCS posted another set of rumors about the device&apos;s supposed camera and display specification, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/06/03/oneplus-13-display-battery-leak/">Gizmochina</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 will supposedly feature an "upgraded" 50MP periscope triple camera setup. The tipster didn&apos;t suggest what the other two lenses would be. Additionally, the phone is rumored to offer a 6.8-inch 2K 8T LTPO "customized" display.</p><p>The post explains that the display will be almost entirely flat as OnePlus could place a "micro-curved" glass on top of it. Such changes might add to its "conventionally" large display size.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is a device that launched without any noticeable drawbacks. For context, the device offers a 6.8-inch LTPO AMOLED. However, one of its notable features, which the OnePlus 11 didn&apos;t have, was wireless charging. The 2024 flagship offered 100W wired charging alongside 50W wireless charging capabilities. It was one of the phone&apos;s highest talking points as OnePlus continued to hone its flagship craft.</p><p>Additionally, this year&apos;s launch only offers a 5,400mAh battery, so that&apos;s another improvement aside from its display and camera changes.</p><p>In March, the OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-oneplus-13-leaks-point-to-redesign-and-upgraded-fingerprint-sensor">was rumored</a> to feature a design change and an upgraded fingerprint sensor. Those whispers suggested there could be a change to its "hinge," which was a reference to the phone&apos;s camera visor as it flows off to the side of its frame. Doubling down on that rumor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-oneplus-13r-likely-to-look-different-in-design">was a leak in May</a> that supposedly contained a mock-up of its supposed design changes.</p><p>Speculation states the OnePlus 13 could have its circular camera array moved to the center of its back panel instead of on its side. Moreover, the OnePlus 13R could separate from the pack and offer a side-mounted squarish array.</p><p>Recent rumors have suggested that OnePlus could launch its next flagship phone late this year.</p>

<ul><li>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the Meta Connect 2024 dates — September 25–26 — on Instagram Stories. </li><li>Meta unveiled the Quest 3, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses, and AI features at Connect 2023.</li><li>We expect the leaked Meta Quest 3s and "Orion" AR glasses prototype to appear at Meta Connect 2024. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta Connect 2024 will take place on September 25–26, Mark Zuckerberg revealed in a brief <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/zuck/3382402766048980457?utm_source=ig_story_item_share&igsh=NnRtMmZ4YWQxN2U3" target="_blank">Instagram story</a> on Monday. Meta&apos;s social media accounts promise that Connect 2024 will "explore the future of AI and mixed reality and share progress on our long-term vision to help build the metaverse."</p><p>We won&apos;t know more about the Connect 2024 itinerary for months. That being said, Meta&apos;s PR team prioritizing AI before XR feels like an intentional choice. After Google covered two straight hours of AI at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a>, Meta might take a similar approach this fall, showing off how its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta AI</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Llama 3</a> models have evolved.</p><p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">you&apos;re sick of AI</a>, that won&apos;t sound appealing. But unlike Google, Meta should counterbalance its AI push with plenty of hardware announcements to keep consumers invested.</p><p>Months of leaks have us confident that Zuckerberg will unveil the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s (or Quest Lite)</a> on stage at Meta Connect 2024, just as he revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> at Connect 2023. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🗓️ Mark your calendars 🗓️ Meta Connect 2024 will be September 25 + 26 where we'll explore the future of AI and mixed reality and share progress on our long-term vision to help build the metaverse.<a href="https://twitter.com/MetaNewsroom/status/1797709393989140935">June 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The Meta Quest 3s is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-meta-quest-3s-looks-like-quest-2-with-new-brain-and-eyeballs">rumored</a> to have the Quest 3&apos;s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and RGB cameras for full-color XR passthrough, but the thicker Quest 2 lenses with lower display resolution — all to target an alleged $299 price tag that&apos;ll appeal to budget buyers. </p><p>Meta announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">open-source Horizon OS</a> earlier this year, with partners like ASUS ROG and Lenovo promising to make their own VR headsets. So it&apos;s <em>possible</em> they could join the stage at Connect to exhibit their new hardware — though we suspect Meta wouldn&apos;t want these companies to steal the Quest 3s&apos; thunder. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5E8BKUEYYRzqjuJSS9hi9m" name="Meta-Connect-2023-logo.jpeg" alt="Meta Connect 2023 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5E8BKUEYYRzqjuJSS9hi9m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, we&apos;ve heard credible reports that Meta intends to show off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-will-reportedly-showcase-prototype-ar-glasses-at-connect-2024">Orion AR glasses prototype at Connect 2024</a>. Allegedly, there is "internal pressure to ensure a high level of performance" with this prototype when it&apos;s first shown off to the public. </p><p>Caitlin Kalinowski, Meta&apos;s Head of AR Glasses Hardware, told us in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">exclusive interview</a> that they&apos;re working on AR glasses with "high field-of-view immersion" that will, in her words, trigger the same "Oh my God, WOW! I can&apos;t believe this" reactions as the original Oculus Rift when it first introduced a ton of people to VR. </p>
<p>While Meta&apos;s AR glasses won&apos;t be consumer-ready for years, Meta Connect 2024 attendees might have the chance to try the first-ever public prototype. In the meantime, Meta will probably spend time focusing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses</a>, which recently got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">major multimodal AI upgrade</a>.</p><p>Last year&apos;s event took place on Meta&apos;s campus in Menlo Park, California, while pre-pandemic Connects took place at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. We&apos;ll find out later this year where to expect this next event, but non-Californians should be able to stream the keynote via Facebook or YouTube. </p>

<hr>
<p>Slowly but surely, more information about the Pixel 9 series is coming to light, and the latest leaks involve Google&apos;s 2024 chipset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rozetked.me/news/33532-eksklyuziv-rezul-taty-testov-pixel-9-9-pro-i-9-pro-xl">Rozetked </a>(Russian) spotted the Pixel 9 trio undergoing the hurdles of the AnTuTu benchmark test (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-tensor-g4-benchmark-scores/">Android Police</a>). Running the Tensor G4, the base Pixel 9 scored 1.07 million points. The middle Pixel 9 Pro achieved 1.14 million points, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL reached 1.17 million points.</p><p>As the publication notes, these numbers ma]\y seem high, but they&apos;re only slightly higher than the base Pixel 8 at 900,000. This is likely due to Google&apos;s minimal changes, as the Tensor G4 features an ARMv9-A core architecture.</p><p>Simply put, the chip offers one Cortex-A4 at 3.1GHz, three Cortex-A720 cores at 2.6GHz, and four Cortex-A520 cores at 1.95GHz.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem like we&apos;re in for a <em>major </em>power boost for the Pixel series with the Tensor G4. However, it&apos;s worth noting that these early test numbers aren&apos;t indicative of the Pixel 9&apos;s final release strength.</p><p>Things could get better (or stay the same), so we&apos;ll have to wait until after the summer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xgvtt3MTWkd3FCeurfaaXT" name="google-pixel-9-9-pro-9-xl-alleged-trio-live-photos.jpg" alt="An alleged look at a live photo of the entire Pixel 9 series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xgvtt3MTWkd3FCeurfaaXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rozetked)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For context, last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Tensor G3</a> features one Cortex-X3 core clocked at 2.91 GHz, four Cortex-A715 performance cores (2.37 GHz), and four Cortex-A510 cores (1.7 GHz). Google&apos;s chip features one more core dedicated to efficiency, however, it fell short of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in terms of speed for its performance and prime cores. Moreover, the chip still gets warm pretty quickly and it&apos;s bad news for gamers as their FPS will continuously drop during long play sessions.</p><p>AI was what Google banked on — and there&apos;s no reason why that wouldn&apos;t continue to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">be the case this year</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s been rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-might-not-surprise">since last year</a> that the Tensor G4 might not be a major powerhouse over the G3. The chip is supposedly using the codename "Zuma Pro," which builds upon the G3&apos;s "Zuma" name. Speculation pointed toward a more minimal upgrade as Google reportedly scrapped its entirely new processor, codename "Redondo," due to sharp delays.</p><p>Other reports stated the chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">will lean on Samsung&apos;s</a> third-generation SF4P 4nm process. This, again, is only <em>slightly </em>better than the Tensor G3&apos;s SF4 process. Elsewhere, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">entire Pixel 9 series</a> leaked in live photos just hours before Google&apos;s I/O 2024 keynote event in May.</p>
