<p>Swedish EV (electric vehicle) maker Polestar has debuted its first smartphone aimed at the Chinese market.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/polestar-joins-ev-tech-crossover-with-made-for-china-smartphone">Bloomberg</a>, Polestar debuted the new phone at an event in Beijing, China, ahead of an auto show it plans to attend. The move appears to be part of a technological shift between automakers and smartphone OEMs.</p><p>Polestar states that its device is the culmination of work between its team in Gothenburg, Sweden, and China&apos;s smartphone manufacturer, Xingji Meizu Group.</p><p>Xingji Meizu&apos;s chief executive officer, Shen Ziyu, noted that the move was something of a "defensive measure due to Huawei and Xiaomi starting to make cars" and that the phone is the result of a shift as the "auto industry incorporates more intelligent technologies and consumer electronics."</p><p>The Swedish company states its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polestar.cn/zh-cn/polestar-phone/">Polestar Phone</a>" is its first "AI-designed flagship phone" for Chinese consumers. The device features a 6.7-inch display with a 21:9 aspect ratio and an impressive 6,000 nits of peak brightness. Powering the device is Qualcomm&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC.</p><p>The device&apos;s AI features include image generation, image search, and text summaries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1682px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3VZwJh3juYwdPbUsH5gJhT" name="polestar-phone-items-in-box.jpg" alt="The contents inside the Polestar Phone box." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3VZwJh3juYwdPbUsH5gJhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1682" height="946" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Polestar)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the back, the Polestar Phone provides a vertical triple camera setup. Consumers will discover a 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens. The front contains a 32MP punch-hole selfie lens.</p><p>A 5,050mAh battery will keep the lights on throughout the day, with support for 50W Super Wireless charging. Additionally, consumers can pack up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage in the Polestar Phone.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company teases a strong marriage between the phone and its EVs. Polestar has equipped the device with software developed based on Meizu&apos;s "Flyme Auto." Polestar states this will create a "seamless interconnection between mobile phones and cars."</p><p>Moreover, this pairing allows messages, calls, music, and videos to be displayed on a Polestar vehicle&apos;s dashboard while driving. The device&apos;s "Polestar Link" functionality lets users utilize their phone as a UWB digital car key.Â </p><p>The Polestar Phone starts at 7,388 yuan in China, which is roughly $1,019.</p>

<p>Polestar&apos;s entrance into the smartphone space may seem odd; however, other Chinese makers like Nio Inc. have done the same. More importantly, smartphone OEMs like Huawei and Xiaomi have gone the opposite way, entering the EV industry with their own cars. Similarly, Waymo, owned by Google&apos;s parent company, Alphabet, operates an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/automotive/waymo-uber-partnership-announcement">array of self-driving cars</a>.</p><p>Polestar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/677700/polestar-announces-global-volumes-for-the-fourth-quarter-including-a-strong-start-to-polestar-4-deli">reported in January</a> that its EV sales have hit a slump. Polestar missed its 60,000 vehicle sales projection as it tallied 54,000 by the end of Q4 2023.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that Polestar is cutting 450 people to help cover its losses.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New information reveals the first possible handsets to feature flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC.</li><li>The Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro will be the first, followed by OnePlus 13 and iQOO 13.</li><li>The Oryon CPU chipset will likely debut at the Snapdragon Summit in October 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi has often been among the first OEMs to first debut Qualcomm&apos;s latest flagship chipset, like the Xiaomi 14, which was announced during the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 launch. According to new information, the same is likely to happen this year.</p><p>Xiaomi is believed to still hold the rights of the first OEM maker to launch the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset, per the noted tipster Yogesh Brar on X. The new flagship chipset from Qualcomm will most likely be unveiled in the fall of this year at the Snapdragon Summit and make its way first to the Xiaomi 15 series â the successors of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>.Â </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xiaomi still has the exclusive first launch rights for Snapdragon 8 Gen 4Followed by both OnePlus & iQOOLineup includes Xiaomi 15 / 15 Pro, OnePlus 13, iQOO 13<a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1782643566424264712">April 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Presumably, the launch of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> from Xiaomi will happen during Q4 of this year if last year&apos;s models are any indication. The launch will perhaps be limited to the Chinese region, later followed by a Xiaomi 15 Ultra model (with the same chipset), the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, in select regions.</p><p>While Xiaomi may get first dibs on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 this year, Brar further shares the line-up of phones that will be among the first to arrive with the new chip. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is expected to be next in line and could launch by the year&apos;s end or at the early start of next year. It will likely first cater to the Chinese region, followed by a global launch sometime in Q1, 2025.</p><p>Next up would be the iQOO with its iQOO 13, which could also see its China launch in Q4 2024 and global launch early next year.Â </p>
<p>As for the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, we have some idea of what to expect from the next top-tier processor from Qualcomm.Â </p><p>The chipset&apos;s possible launch was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">already revealed</a> by Don McGuire, Qualcomm&apos;s CMO, at MWC early this year, and the company has also teased the incorporation of Oryon CPUs for the first time, which is expected to boost performance significantly over the current Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Likewise, some benchmark leaks have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">showcased</a> the upcoming chipset&apos;s performance ranking, meaning we have a lot to look forward to with Qualcomm&apos;s next-gen chipset.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s budget sub-brand could have a smartphone in development as a curious model number appears for certification.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-nothing-phone-3-is-coming-out-this-summer.html">Android Headlines</a>, a Nothing product with the model number "A015" was spotted in a database under the brand&apos;s manufacturer title. It was originally theorized that the number referred to the Nothing Phone 3; however, the model number doesn&apos;t follow Nothing&apos;s typical internal naming behavior.</p><p>Remember: the Phone 1 featured the "A063" tag while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> had "A065."</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nothing-phone-3-model-number-leaked-expected-launch/">91Mobiles</a> quickly picked up on the appearance of the same model number in the BIS certification database. Curiously, its listing swaps "Nothing Technology Limited" for "CMF by Nothing" under the brand category.</p><p>This discovery seemingly reduces the chance of the A015 device representing the Phone 3 to (almost) zero. Aside from the supposed model number, the product&apos;s specifications and more substantial information were unavailable.</p><p>There&apos;s a chance that this model number refers to a completely different product. So, it&apos;d be best to take this rumor with caution.</p>

<p>CMF by Nothing is the London-based company&apos;s sub-brand that tries to merge style at a lower cost. The brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cmf-by-nothing-buds-pro-watch-pro-announced">debuted</a> last September as it launched the Buds Pro, Watch Pro, and a 65W GaN charging adapter. It&apos;ll be interesting to see if this CMF by Nothing smartphone rumor holds water â and where such a device would fit.</p><p>Nothing debuted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> early in April as a budget option nestled right below the capabilities of the Phone 2. The device diverged from Qualcomm&apos;s chipset in favor of MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7200 Pro. The phone launched in the UK, India, and other regions, leaving the U.S. out of the loop.</p><p>Current speculations are that CMF by Nothing&apos;s phone would become available in specific countries, similar to Phone 2a, to avoid self-competition.</p><p>While this rumor seemingly turns us away from the Phone 3, a recent report purported to have some details on the chipset powering the Phone 3. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-qualcomm-chip-price-rumors">report claimed</a> that the Phone 3 would lean on Qualcomm&apos;s latest flagship chip variant: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>. The rumor added that Nothing could increase the price of its upcoming phone, which could put it at roughly $540 in the U.S. if true.</p>

<p>Best Buy is no stranger to great Android phone deals, but they just quietly launched a limited-time Spring Sale that deserves some particular attention. There hasn&apos;t been a lot of pomp surrounding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c">the Best Buy sale</a> just yet, but I&apos;m noticing some major price drops on AC favorites like the Samsung Galaxy S24 series, the Google Pixel 8 Pro, and many others. In other words, if you want to beat the crowds, keep reading: I&apos;ve gathered a selection of my favorite offers below.Â </p><p>In addition to good old-fashioned discounts, it&apos;s worth noting that many Best Buy deals also include free stuff like streaming services and additional savings when you activate a device or trade in. I&apos;ll make note of those goodies whenever they&apos;re available. How long will these Android phone deals last? It&apos;s hard to know for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t wait too long. It&apos;s also worth noting that Amazon appears to be matching Best Buy&apos;s prices at every turn, so if something is sold out, use our <strong>Price checker</strong> to see where you should go next.

<hr>
<p>It&apos;s been a long road for smart display glasses, but Rokid seems to have finally cracked the code. The company just announced Rokid AR Lite, a new product that encompasses two separate products into one sleek package: Rokid Max 2 smart display glasses and the Rokid Station 2 compute module.</p><p>Rokid Max 2 glasses include a new display that&apos;s capable of wider FoV, creating a virtual 300-inch screen at what looks like 6 meters away. The glasses include a motion mode that keeps this screen stable even during airplane turbulence, helping to reduce motion-induced dizziness. Rokid Max 2 comes equipped with what the company called "ultra-light air nose pads" and soft, bendable temples.</p><p>However, the real innovation here is the Intelligent Interpupillary Distance Adjustment (IPD) adjustment system. My biggest comfort problem with nearly all existing smart display glasses is that there&apos;s no way to adjust the spacing between the lenses, a basic necessity in assuring long-term comfort on VR headsets.</p><p>Everyone&apos;s eyes are spaced apart a little differently, and the wrong spacing between the glasses&apos; lenses can cause dizziness and eye discomfort. Rokid isn&apos;t using a physical IPD slider though. Rather, the company will have software IPD adjustment so you can move things around as needed. Hopefully, this will fix the cropping issue seen around the edges of the display on other smart glasses, too.</p><p>Additionally, Rokid Max 2 ships with non-destructive diopter adjustment for near-sighted individuals. Some other glasses have this â <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">Viture One</a>, for instance â but having this ensures that more folks can comfortably use these glasses without having to outfit them with a special pair of prescription lenses. That, combined with the IPD adjustment, should make these the most comfortable smart display glasses ever made.</p>

<p>The Rokid Station 2 is part of the Rokid AR Lite package, an upgraded version of the compute module Rokid previously shipped. Companies like Xreal have shipped similar products, but Rokid Station 2 looks like a substantial upgrade in several ways.</p><p>Rokid Station 2 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and runs the company&apos;s proprietary YodaOS-Master operating system. It&apos;s got a 5,000mAh battery inside, dual USB-C ports, and supports 18W charging. Rokid Station 2&apos;s top acts as a touchpad, capable of being used like a mousepad when placed flat on a surface. Additionally, the unit ships with 3DoF sensors, which can be used as a pointer remote for quick navigation.</p><p>Rokid Station 2 enables multiscreen mode and spatial screen casting so you can run multiple windows in 3D virtual space as if you had a set of monitors floating in front of you. This should enable use of your favorite apps and services without needing native apps, as you should be able to connect your computer or phone. The original Rokid Station ran Android TV, but we&apos;re not yet sure what Rokid Station 2 uses. We&apos;ve reached out to Rokid and will update this article when we find out.</p><p>The company is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.rokid.com/pages/rokid-ar-lite">Rokid AR Lite Kickstarter campaign</a> soon where we&apos;ll find out pricing and a tentative release date. The company offers a slew of goodies for "pioneer" investors for $9.90 on its website, including a T-shirt, badge, priority shipping, VIP group service, and offline priority experience.</p>

<ul><li>Android already has an accessibility feature called "extra dim" that allows your phone's display to get dimmer than usual.Â </li><li>Now, with Android 15, Google appears to be working on an "even dimmer" option that might make it easier to use your phone at lower brightness levels than are usually possible.</li><li>While the "extra dim" feature needs to be set each time you want to use it, the new "even dimmer" feature might affect Android's inbuilt Adaptive brightness setting.Â </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 15 might give you more control over your phone&apos;s minimum brightness, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-even-dimmer-3436221/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">Android 15 Beta 1</a> code. A new setting is referenced in code strings called "even dimmer," and this is related to your phone&apos;s brightness settings. Android already has an option called "extra dim" which needs to be manually enabled each time you want to use it.Â </p><p>Unfortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> don&apos;t give you full control over your smartphone&apos;s brightness level. You can set preferences like Adaptive brightness or adjust the actual brightness slider; however, phones are still bound by minimum and maximum brightness settings set by the manufacturer. In many cases, these minimums don&apos;t match the actual lowest brightness level your phone&apos;s display panel is capable of.Â </p><p>This could change with the newly discovered setting. According to the report, the option will be located below the Adaptive brightness toggle on the Display page of the Android 15 settings app. This setting isn&apos;t actually visible in the current version of the Android 15 beta, though, so the functionality of "even dimmer" isn&apos;t certain yet. In the code strings, Google says the feature will "allow the device to go dimmer than usual."</p><p>An alternate explanation Android Authority found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a> flag related to "even dimmer" says that it will be used "for extending the brightness below [the] traditional range."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff" name="android-15-brightness.jpg" alt="Android 15 brightness slider in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Based on the way the feature is described, the folks at Android Authority think that "even dimmer" might be functionally different than "extra dim." While the "extra dim" option is a manual setting that needs to be intentionally used every time you need a really dim phone display, the "even dimmer" choice could affect the Adaptive brightness settings. In practice, this means users could set and forget this toggle in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> settings app.Â </p><p>The AOSP description seems to support this theory, as the phrase "extending the range" of your phone&apos;s brightness suggests that the brightness levels are still variable.</p><p>However, this is all just speculation, so we&apos;ll have to wait for future beta releases of Android 15 that may include this feature in a working capacity. If it does indeed appear in the final Android 15 release, "even dimmer" would make your Android phone easier on the eyes in dark lighting situations, although depending on how it works, it could be a headache for people with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing has confirmed a data breach from 2022 that saw the data of 2,250 Nothing Community members left vulnerable.</li><li>While no passwords or other types of sensitive information were accessible in the breach, the email addresses of users were stolen.</li><li>Now, the email addresses and other information related to the breach were found online in an apparent database dump.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing came under fire after initially partnering with Sunbird for Nothing Chats, the company that left user messages completely unencrypted and easily accessible. Unsurprisingly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-chats-pulled-from-play-store">Nothing Chats was shut down quickly</a>, but not before Nothing&apos;s reputation took a hit. Now, an earlier data breach on the Nothing Community forums from 2022 has surfaced, affecting thousands of users.Â </p><p>The situation came to light on Sunday, April 21, when a few users on X (formerly Twitter) reported discovering personal information used with Nothing Community accounts on an online database. Most of the data included in the dump was already publicly available, like Nothing Community usernames. However, user emails (which are not public-facing on Nothing Community) were also leaked.Â </p><p>The posts were first blurred and then eventually taken down to prevent bad actors from exploiting the data exposed in the database. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-community-alleged-data-breach-3436010/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> found and confirmed that the database existed, adding that there is no evidence user account passwords were leaked. In addition to user data, official emails of Nothing employees were also discovered in the online database.Â </p><p>Nothing confirmed the data breach in a statement to Android Authority on Monday evening, stating that the vulnerability dated back to 2022.Â </p><p>"In December 2022, Nothing discovered a vulnerability, which impacted email addresses belonging to community members at the time," the company said. "No names, personal addresses, passwords, or payment information were compromised. Upon this discovery nearly a year and half ago, Nothing took immediate action to remedy the situation and bolster its security features."</p>

<p>As far as data breaches are concerned, the Nothing Community leak appears to have a very small scope. Aside from seeing an uptick in spam emails, there will likely be limited impact to Nothing Community users following the breach. Users can change their passwords just to be save, but that probably isn&apos;t necessary because no Nothing Community account passwords were stolen.Â </p><p>Notably, it does not appear that Nothing made an attempt to contact affected users that their email addresses may have been exposed. It did make undisclosed internal changes to protect user data going forward, however.</p><p>While relatively minor, it&apos;s the latest recent instance of Nothing being the center of a data and privacy incident. Although the vulnerabilities date back to 2022, this breach comes to the surface as users still recall the Nothing Chats debacle quite well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/somehow-sunbird-returned">as Sunbird stages a comeback</a>.Â </p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve seen a few renders leak of Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel 8a, but now, more live images of the mid-range smartphone have just popped up on the web, revealing the more vibrant color options.</p><p>An X user has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Mohamma11824513">shared</a> live images of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://droidreader.pt/google-pixel-8a-imagens-verdadeiro-smartphone/">DroidReader</a>), showing off the Mint and Bay color hues that more or less match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-google-pixel-8a-renders-reveal-color-options">recent renders</a> of the Pixel 7a&apos;s successor.Â Per the X post, the device is allegedly being sold in some markets in the Morocco region, and the shared image also appears to have been captured by a retail store.</p>

<p>From the images, the 8a has a rather matte finish with a brushed metal camera visor, a bit of a combination of the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro. While the Pixel 7a introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-pixel-7a-should-you-buy">Coral color option</a>, Google is apparently looking to follow up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-mint-green">Mint Pixel 8</a> with a similar option for the 8a.</p><p>Aside from the new exciting color options, the Pixel 8a will also be seen in the Obsidian and Porcelain â the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-retail-box-leaks">live images</a> of the former also surfaced online a few times already.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) listed an unreleased Google product in its database on Monday, April 22.Â </li><li>Google's instructions to the FCC for how to view the product's digital regulatory information hint that it is a Wear OS smartwatch.</li><li>Due to the timing of the listing, it seems unlikely that the FCC filing is related to the upcoming Google Pixel Watch 3.Â </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> has only been out for about half a year, all eyes are on the upcoming Pixel Watch 3. Leaks and rumors have already indicated that Google may offer the Pixel Watch in multiple sizes for the first time this year, giving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch buyers</a> more choice. The launch of the Pixel Watch 3 is still many months away, which is why it was surprising that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) listed a new Wear OS watch from Google in its database on Monday, April 22.</p><p>The unreleased product, referenced by the model number <strong>G4SKY</strong>, is not explicitly described in the listing, which was first discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/22/google-wear-os-fcc-not-pixel-watch-3/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. However, they are attributed to a company â in this case, Google.</p><p>Normally, it would be tricky to pinpoint what kind of product is being referenced in the FCC filings without the help of familiar model numbers and other details. The filing for G4SKY includes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=7202469" target="_blank">document</a> explaining how users can access digital regulatory information for the product, and Google explains as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regulatory information, certification, and compliance marks can be found with the following steps from the Home screen: Settings > System > Regulatory Information.</strong></li></ul>
<p>These instructions match the process for accessing the regulatory information of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> such as the Pixel Watch or Pixel Watch 2, and this is what tells us the unreleased product is likely a Wear OS smartwatch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mFx9dLkFoZVkqNrNZqeuz4" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-bay-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mFx9dLkFoZVkqNrNZqeuz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The disclosed connectivity options further support the theory that G4SKY is a Wear OS device. There is only one configuration of the product, and it offers support with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE. Because this device can be used with a cellular connection, Â it has to be a Wear OS watch or an Android phone or tablet. However, since the FCC listing doesn&apos;t mention any 5G connectivity, it&apos;s unlikely to be the latter two.</p><p>Essentially, the combination of supported connectivity options and E-label instructions all but guarantee that the newly listed product is a Google smartwatch. It&apos;s a bit early for this to be a sign of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, so it&apos;s unclear exactly what this device will be. 9to5Google posits the mysterious device could be a midrange Pixel Watch or even a Fitbit smartwatch running Wear OS, which would be interesting in either case.</p><p>Google I/O is happening next month, but no leaks have pointed to a smartwatch appearing at the event this year. Anything is possible, so we&apos;ll just have to wait and see, but it gives us something else to look forward to at the event.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly gearing up to launch a new Chromecast with Google TV 4K, which would replace the almost four-year-old model sold today.</li><li>The company may address the streaming dongle's performance woes with a new chip offering more RAM or storage and a potential OS upgrade.</li><li>Additionally, Google appears to be working on a new Chromecast Voice Remote that could ship with the upcoming Chromecast with Google TV 4K refresh.</li></ul>

<p>The streaming stick market has become a race to provide the best specs at the lowest prices, especially in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> sector of the market. Google&apos;s first Chromecast with Google TV 4K offered an Android-based OS, intuitive remote, and 4K resolution for just $50 when it was first released in 2020. Now that it&apos;s going on four years old, the Chromecast with Google TV 4K is showing its age and could really use an upgrade. That might be finally coming soon.</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/22/new-4k-chromecast-google-tv/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, a source confirmed that a Chromecast with Google TV 4K successor is in development, and the company is gearing up for a launch. Prior reports indicated that Google was working on an Android-equipped Chromecast device, but it wasn&apos;t known for certain what functionality or price point it would target. The upcoming streaming dongle will be the first from Google since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV HD</a> was updated back in 2022.Â </p><p>While it&apos;s likely the next-generation Chromecast with Google TV 4K will include a slew of improvements across the board, a point of focus looks to be the remote. Last year, a brand-new version of the Chromecast Voice Remote was spotted in an Android TV 14 beta. While the graphic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-tv-14-beta">inside the beta Android TV 14 release</a> depicted a remote similar to the current Chromecast Voice remote, there were key differences. Notably, the new remote expected to ship with the Chromecast with Google TV 4K will have more dedicated buttons.</p>

<p>The current Chromecast with Google TV 4K still runs Android 12 TV, so the jump to Android 14 TV seems plausible. The operating system upgrade includes a few new software features that would improve usability without any hardware changes. However, it is also reasonable that Google would upgrade the aging chip found within the Chromecast with Google TV 4K that is sold today, which is the Amlogic S905X3.Â </p><p>This processor isn&apos;t great, featuring just 2GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Processing power isn&apos;t as important on a streaming dongle as it is on something like a smartphone, but RAM and on-device storage still matter. As such, a new chip could go a long way in making the Chromecast with Google TV 4K more enjoyable to use. 9to5Google suspects that the company may go with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/android-tv-amlogic-x5-chip-revealed">Amlogic S905X5 processor</a>, which is a two-generations-newer chip than the Amlogic S905X3 from four years ago.</p><p>We don&apos;t know exactly when the next-generation 4K streaming dongle from Google will debut, but 9to5Google&apos;s phrasing hints at an imminent release. Though Google I/O is only a few weeks away, it&apos;s unlikely something like a Chromecast with Google TV 4K would be released at the event.Â </p>
