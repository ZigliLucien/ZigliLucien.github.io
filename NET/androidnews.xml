<ul><li>Google is rolling out user's "highly requested" voice messages feature in Chat.</li><li>Users can tap the microphone icon in a chat or group thread in the app with the option to re-record if needed before sending.</li><li>Unfortunately, Google left out personal accounts from voice messages in Chat, meaning Enterprise customers are first in line.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is beginning to roll out a new update to Chat today (Mar. 26) that brings a long-awaited messaging feature to the platform.</p><p>Google Chat now supports voice messages on its platform, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/03/send-voice-messages-in-google-chat.html">Workspace update</a>. The company states that the feature will only be available on mobile devices with this rollout as it continues to develop a version for desktops. Google states that voice messages in Chat should help users "convey more information" and deliver more emphasis.</p><p>Users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android</a> and iOS can tap the microphone icon beside the image option in a one-on-one or group chat. Chat will begin recording audio; when you&apos;re done, you&apos;ll have the chance to listen to it and re-record if there are mistakes. After that, users can send their recordings.</p><p>Those you&apos;re chatting with can quote, react, and reply to it within a thread. Google teased that it&apos;s also working on adding voice message transcriptions, which should arrive "in the coming months."</p><p>Unfortunately, Google has left personal account holders out of its rollout of voice messages in Chat. The company states Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Essentials Plus, Enterprise Standard, and Enterprise Plus users are eligible to receive it.</p><p>Users on Google&apos;s rapid release schedule will see voice messages arrive today (Mar. 26). They should give the process at least 15 days to complete. Google will shift to the "Scheduled Release" domains on April 15.</p><p>Admins of the previously mentioned domains will find that voice messages are turned on by default.</p>

<p>Google has been working on voice messages in Chat for a while now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-spotted">an interview</a> with the company also stated that its customers had requested the feature quite often. Google stated that a feature like this would help further evolve Chat from a simple text-based app to one that supports multimedia modalities.</p><p>Chat also picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-for-android-gets-starred-messages-feature">an update in February</a> that brought it closer to Messages as users can now "Star" messages. Starring messages in Chat enables folks to rediscover them through search and spot what&apos;s important easily using its bright star icon. Searching for saved or "starred" messages joins users&apos; ability to discover mentions in the app.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has started pushing its latest major camera update to its Galaxy S24 series today (Mar. 26).</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-april-2024-update-camera-improvements-europe/">SamMobile</a>, the latest update is available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">S24</a> trio in Europe, bearing version number S92xBXXU1AXCA. With a focus on its cameras, Samsung&apos;s changelog states it has improved the S24&apos;s white balance accuracy and exposure for its cameras.</p><p>Low light image quality is another area that is receiving an update today. Samsung threw in a few more camera updates, which include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Text clarity in high-zoom shots.</li><li>Color accuracy in the ExpertRAW camera app.</li><li>Support for videos with 480×480 pixels resolution in the Instant Slow Mo feature.</li></ul>

<p>This Galaxy S24 update is hefty, arriving with an approximate 920MB download size. Samsung&apos;s patch notes add that the device has also picked up the April 2024 security patch with these camera improvements. Neither Samsung nor Google have detailed what the April security patch contains just yet.</p><p>Those in Europe should begin noticing the patch today (Mar. 26). With that, it should only be a matter of time before those in other regions, like the U.S., begin picking it up. The patch has also been spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/huge-galaxy-s24-update-improve-camera-quality-released-india/">rolling out in India</a>. If you&apos;d like to check manually, you can head into <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download & Install.</strong></p><p>This is the second camera patch Samsung has created for the Galaxy S24 series, as the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-get-february-security-patch">landed in February</a>. The Korean OEM fine-tuned the image quality and sharpness that its latest flagship launch could provide. The update attempted to improve the low light capabilities of the S24, but it looks like more was required, as we&apos;re seeing it mentioned again.</p><p>That patch also introduced the company&apos;s new Vivid display slider for folks unhappy with the changed profile on the S24 trio.</p><p>Meanwhile, we&apos;re still waiting for the large One UI 6.1 update to drop for Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/signs-point-to-a-one-ui-61-rollout-coming-this-week">might happen soon</a>. A notification from Samsung teased the update in China, stating it could arrive on March 28. It&apos;s still unclear when other regions could see the update, but at least it&apos;s on the way.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra, much like the entire series, is packed full of the company's Galaxy AI software. The device offers a range of on-device tools, capable of handling simple tasks like summarizing long pieces of text and live translations. The S24 Ultra still delivers a stunning, immersive display and multiple cameras strong enough for clear photos and videos.</p></p>

<p>In response to Google&apos;s new Chrome, Qualcomm&apos;s president and CEO Cristiano Amon stated, "The new version of Google Chrome will help cement Snapdragon X Elite&apos;s role as the premier platform for Windows computing starting in mid-2024."</p><p>Qualcomm is going all in on AI with its upcoming Snapdragon X Elite chipset, and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">seems poised</a> to join the journey. The chipmaker is pairing its X Elite chip with its new, stronger Oryon CPU. The chip has been estimated to achieve a CPU speed 2x faster than the competition and AI processing 4.5 times quicker.</p><p>There is hope that Google continues to plug Qualcomm&apos;s new X Elite in more places, namely its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> line, for a massive performance boost.</p><p>Elsewhere, many of the generative AI features Arm-compatible PCs and laptops are preparing to receive include "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help me write</a>." Chrome&apos;s AI update in February lets Workspace users utilize its generative AI software&apos;s "experimental writing AI" to assist them with drafting articles of text.

<ul><li>The Google Pixel 6a has been removed from the US Google Store sale.</li><li>Shoppers are being redirected to the Pixel 7a listing instead.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is expected imminently, with rumors suggesting Google’s I/O event in May as a likely launch date.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Google Pixel 6a</a> marked Google’s first foray into the more affordable sector of the phone market with its refreshed Pixel range. At the time, the handset was very well-received, offering many of the features of its more expensive siblings at a much more affordable price. Having subsequently been replaced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, it appears that the time is drawing near for us to bid the Pixel 6a a fond farewell.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/03/25/google-stops-selling-pixel-6a/">Droid Life</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6a-removed-store-3428543/">Android Authority</a>), the Pixel 6a has been removed from sale on the official US Google Store at some point in the last few days. The phone is no longer available on the site, and if you attempt to access it via an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/gb/config/pixel_7a?hl=en-GB&selections=eyJwcm9kdWN0RmFtaWx5IjoiY0dsNFpXeGZOMkU9In0%3D">old URL</a>, you’ll find yourself on the page for the newer Pixel 7a instead. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YgCoruYwPuJQaXupVMkJmA" name="Google-Pixel-8a-leak.jpg" alt="Pixel 8a hands-on leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgCoruYwPuJQaXupVMkJmA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Abhishek Yadav/ via X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Pixel 6a is unlikely to be a big seller at this stage of its life cycle, the fact it has quietly disappeared indicates that Google is ready to send it to a farm upstate in preparation for a newer device. This is, in all likelihood, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>, which is hotly anticipated to be unveiled shortly. </p><p>A recent report confirmed that a new Google handset – almost certainly the Pixel 8a – has been spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-reaches-us-fcc-listing">FCC databases</a>, lending further weight to its imminent release. The working assumption is that the 8a will be revealed at Google’s I/O event in early May 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-display-upgrade">Other rumors</a> suggest it will be a significant upgrade over the Pixel 7a, which could make it almost as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, anyone who wants to get their hands on a Pixel 6a can still do so from some other retailers, just not directly from Google. The alternative is to consider getting the Pixel 7a, now the only budget handset available on the Google Store. But, given how soon the Pixel 8a is expected to come out, it may be worth hanging on for a few more weeks to see what that handset offers.</p>

To others, it&apos;s too expensive compared to the Quest 2 or not powerful enough against the premium Apple Vision Pro. </p><p>We&apos;ve followed the Quest 3 closely since its late 2023 launch, tracking all of its updates, new games, and controversies. Aside from sharing all the specs and comparisons to other headsets, we&apos;ll share everything that new Quest 3 owners or prospective buyers should know about the headset.</p><p>If you want a more personal breakdown of what it&apos;s like to use the Quest 3, you can read our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3 review</a> for all the highs and lows. In particular, we praised the upgraded mixed-reality passthrough in full color, the more ergonomic controllers, and the revamped graphical power, while noting some design issues and poor battery life.</p><p>Below, we&apos;ll focus instead on all of the raw numbers, prices, accessories, and so on, to help you decide if it&apos;s worth upgrading to the new headset.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-quest-3-price-and-availability"><span>Meta Quest 3: Price and availability</span></h2>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 became publicly available on October 10, 2023. The base 128GB Quest 3 costs $499 / £479 / €549, while the 512GB model is $649 / £619 / €699. </p><p>Aside from storage, you won&apos;t find any other differences, except that all 512GB Quest 3 buyers get six months of free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-plus-subscription">Meta Quest Plus</a>, an $8/month subscription that gives you two Quest games for free, as chosen by Meta.</p><p>We have a guide comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-128gb-vs-512gb">128GB vs. 512GB Quest 3</a> that breaks down the decision. To summarize it briefly, most Quest 3 games measure about 2–3GB in size, but major releases can swell up to 10GB or more — especially with post-launch updates and DLC. 512GB is more than most people need, but if you choose the default 128GB model, you may have to delete games to make space.</p><p>Thankfully, Quest games support cloud storage, so if you do choose the 128GB Quest 3, you can make space in your library and redownload games later.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-quest-3-design-and-display"><span>Meta Quest 3 design and display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mimFbEYQrczyqqaPkENH8f" name="Meta-Quest-3-hands-on-gasket-removed-angle.jpg" alt="The side of the new thinner Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mimFbEYQrczyqqaPkENH8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most visible change to the Meta Quest 3 stems from its pancake lenses, which take up less space than the Quest 2&apos;s fresnel lenses by magnifying through thin, reflective mirrors instead of one thick layer. This makes the Quest 3 headset 40% skinnier in front. </p><p>Despite being skinnier, the Quest 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-quest-3-weighs-more-than-quest-2">weighs slightly more than the Quest 2</a>, which Meta itself attributes to new components like the depth sensor, extra cameras, and depth adjuster. Thankfully, the weight distribution is much more balanced, meaning it&apos;s not all resting on your forehead and slowly creating pressure. </p><p>It&apos;s still going to feel heavy after a while, though. Like the Quest 2, the Quest 3 ships with a cloth strap with velcro to adjust the fit, instead of the built-in Elite Strap with rear padding and adjustment knob you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Quest Pro</a>. </p><p>Unlike the single Quest 2 strap, which could slide to one side of your head, the Quest 3 uses a split overhead strap design that gives you better support but "rubs on the top of your ears," according to our reviewer. </p><p>That&apos;s why we called a Quest 3 strap replacement the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-is-the-one-quest-3-accessory-you-actually-need">"one accessory you actually need."</a> It provides a more comfortable and secure fit, and you can even buy a strap with a built-in battery to improve the Quest 3&apos;s longevity. Since the Quest 3 has a modular design, installing a new strap should only take you a few minutes and doesn&apos;t require any expertise. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nDBZV76enBKAZSWUdzjrQD" name="Meta-Quest-3-hands-on-headset-with-controllers-side-blue.jpg" alt="The USB-C port and power button on the left side of the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nDBZV76enBKAZSWUdzjrQD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A subtle but vital upgrade from the Quest 2 is how you can change how close or far the lenses sit from your eyes, a function built into the facial interface. You&apos;ll choose between four options, with the furthest setting leaving enough room for you to wear glasses without a spacer. </p><p>Plus, there&apos;s the underrated perk that the full-color mixed-reality means you have fewer reasons to <em>take off</em> the headset and worry about adjusting the fit. You can simply double-tap the side to leave your game, see your surroundings, and resolve whatever real-world issue is happening. </p><p>Our one frustration with the new Quest 3 facial design is the lack of venting, which can cause the lenses to fog up from your face&apos;s heat. That&apos;s why you may want to buy a new facial interface that allows for better air circulation. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfy42Q_i944" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Moving on to the Meta Quest 3 display, it uses an LCD, a cost-saving measure that&apos;ll make its colors less vibrant than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a>&apos;s OLED. Putting that aside, though, it&apos;s still a significant visual upgrade over the Quest 2: 2064 x 2208 pixels per eye instead of 1,920 by 1,832 pixels. That gives you an extra 445 pixels per inch (1,218) or 4 pixels per degree (25).</p><p>The PSVR 2&apos;s 2,000 by 2,040 pixels (800ppi) falls short, too, and that headset uses fresnel lenses with a trickier "sweet spot" than the Quest 3&apos;s pancake lenses. For comparison, Meta claims that the new lenses increase visual "sharpness" by 25% by creating "significantly fewer stray or scattered light artifacts." Our experience with the Quest 3&apos;s visual clarity thankfully lives up to Meta&apos;s marketing. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="34jWvW4mHM2HaXcBzLEbJC" name="Meta-Quest-3-hands-on-headset-lenses-02.jpg" alt="Looking closely at the lenses on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34jWvW4mHM2HaXcBzLEbJC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ll also point out that the passthrough resolution is 18 pixels per degree. That&apos;s 7 PPD fewer than its standard VR PPD, but 10X better than the Quest 2 and 3X better than the Quest Pro, enough to make your surroundings fully visible while wearing the headset. In our tests, we found we could read our phone or smartwatch screens without removing our headsets, though it&apos;s still a bit blurry.</p><p>Of course, if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro vs. the Quest 3</a>, you&apos;ll find that the Vision Pro hits 3,386 pixels per inch or 34 pixels per degree, with micro-OLED displays that offer a gorgeous 92% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. But is this resolution boost worth paying an extra $3,000? Frankly, we&apos;re satisfied with what the Quest 3 brings to the table already.</p><p>As a final Quest 3 design point, the newer headset has a redesigned interpupillary distance (IPD) wheel with thirteen spacing settings at 1mm apart. The Quest 2 supported 56–70mm IPDs with three fixed settings, leaving plenty of users stuck with a less-than-ideal distance. Now, anyone from 53–75mm can use it, and finding the right lens spacing will be easier. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-quest-3-specs"><span>Meta Quest 3 specs</span></h2>

<p>One of the main reasons to upgrade from the Quest 2 is the performance gap. The Quest 3&apos;s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 has twice as fast graphical performance and improved loading times compared to the Quest 2&apos;s Gen 1 chip. You also get an extra 2GB of RAM. </p><p>In practice, this allows developers to patch Quest 2 games to add better shadows, lighting, textures, and so on. Plus, of course, you get mixed-reality modes that the Quest 2 can&apos;t support with its low-res, black-and-white passthrough. </p><p>One thing that hasn&apos;t changed with the new generation: the Quest 3 battery life is just as short as the Quest 2&apos;s, if not worse. Meta estimates it lasts 2.2 hours per session or 2.4 hours for gaming, but we&apos;ve found it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-long-does-the-quest-3-battery-last">usually close to 2 hours flat</a> unless you use a battery pack. Once dead, the Quest 3 takes two hours to recharge; it ships with an 18W power adapter and charging cable in the box. </p>

<p>Qualcomm says this chip works with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/wi-fi-7-is-here-but-should-you-care">Wi-Fi 7</a> standard, but Meta has only promised <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wi-fi-6e-router">Wi-Fi 6E router</a> support thus far. The faster Wi-Fi should help with improved PC VR gaming, but you can still stick with a USB-C Link cable for the most reliable connection. </p><p>Meta improved the speaker quality for the Quest 3, claiming it hits a 40% louder volume with increased bass compared to the Quest 2. You still have the 3.5mm headphone jack for private audio and sparing your neighbors, but otherwise, you may not need to buy Quest 3 headphones if you&apos;re happy with the built-in solution. </p><p>If you own the Quest 2 or PSVR 2 and are considering buying this headset, we have guides on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Quest 3 vs. Quest 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-vs-psvr-2">Quest 3 vs. PSVR 2</a> to help you decide. </p>

<p>All of your Quest 2 games will transfer over to the Quest 3, as your account won&apos;t change. Our old list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-games">best Quest games</a> still applies to the new headset, and we can hope to see faster loading times for those games, too.</p><p>From now on, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-games-launching-this-month">upcoming Quest games</a> will release simultaneously on the Quest 2 & 3. Although some of these games will have a unique Quest 3 patch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3-vs-quest-2-graphics-upgrade">enhanced graphics</a>, that&apos;s not a guarantee. The enhanced Snapdragon chip will lower loading times automatically, but many developers cap refresh rates and assets with the Quest 2 in mind, since more people have the older headset.</p><p>For the most part, the only Quest 3 exclusives will be games that require full-color mixed reality, something the Quest 2 can&apos;t offer. </p><p>If you&apos;re a new Quest 3 owner, we&apos;ve recommended the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-quest-3-launch-games">five best Quest 3 launch titles</a> to get you started. </p>

<p>Thus far, Meta has announced these official Quest 3 accessories:</p>
<ul><li>Meta Quest 3 Silicone Facial Interface ($40)</li><li>Meta Quest Active Straps for Touch Plus Controllers ($40)</li><li>Zenni VR Prescription Lenses for Meta Quest 3 ($50)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap ($70)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Carrying Case ($70)</li><li>Meta Quest Link Cable ($80)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap with Battery ($130)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Charging Dock ($130)</li><li>Meta Quest Touch Pro Controllers ($300)</li></ul>
<p>Most of these names will look familiar. You&apos;ll buy these Quest 3 accessories to improve the battery life, store and charge the headset, play PC VR games, and so on. One new thing to note: you can now buy straps and facial interfaces in new colors like orange and blue, not just the usual white. </p><p>They&apos;re also quite expensive! And in one instance, Meta&apos;s Elite Strap with Battery had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3-elite-strap-battery-charging-defect">a charging firmware issue</a> that required a recall. The current version for sale is fixed, but it still frustrated people that this expensive accessory didn&apos;t work as intended.</p><p>Thankfully, third-party Quest 3 accessory makers like BoboVR, AMVR, and KIWI Design have already made more affordable accessories, with more in the works for later this year. Check our guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Quest 3 accessories</a> to see where to get started. </p><p>Most of your old Quest 2 accessories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/most-quest-2-accessories-wont-work-on-quest-3">won&apos;t work with the Quest 3</a>. Thanks to the redesigns to the new headset, most of this old tech won&apos;t fit properly. We know that some 3rd-party accessory makers like BoboVR have promised to release mod kits to make your old accessories work, but there&apos;s no guarantee every brand will do this.</p><p>So far, we know that your old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-link-cable-alternative-oculus-quest-2">Link cables</a> should continue to work, if you don&apos;t want to rely on Air Link and the new Wi-Fi 6E capabilities for wireless PC VR. And if you own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/are-quest-pro-controllers-worth-buying-for-quest-2">Quest Pro controllers</a> (normally $300), you can use those in place of the Quest 3 Touch Plus controllers. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-quest-3-post-launch-news"><span>Quest 3 post-launch news</span></h2>
<p>These are the main post-launch Quest 3 updates, announcements, and controversies that you&apos;ll want to know about!</p><p>After its early October launch, the Quest 3 received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v59-update-adds-battery-saver-mode-fix">v59 software update</a> that added a battery saver mode, in Meta&apos;s attempt to counteract its short battery life. It also made it easier to set up a mixed-reality space automatically instead of drawing the space manually.</p><p>We learned in November 2023 that Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">tried to get the Play Store on Quest headsets</a>, but Google didn&apos;t want to play ball. We learned later, during some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">public Meta-Google beef</a>, that Google would only provide its apps if Meta agreed to make Quest headsets run fully on Android, with Google in control of software. Because of this, the Quest 3&apos;s productivity software continues to be meager compared to the Vision Pro&apos;s. </p><p>As part of this drama, Meta suddenly disabled Chromecasting at some point last year before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/chromecasting-is-officially-back-on-meta-quest">restoring the feature</a> due to a flurry of Quest user complaints. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b8k5H77TMKux3unQRpbMfk" name="meta-quest-pro-google-play-store-logo.jpg" alt="The Google Play Store logo on the lenses of a Meta Quest Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8k5H77TMKux3unQRpbMfk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We then learned that the Meta Quest 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-manufacturing-cost">costs about $430 to make</a>, meaning that Meta barely makes any profit on headset sales and must recoup its investment in game and accessory sales. </p><p>In December, Meta released the v60 update with new Horizon Home environments and boundary fixes, but it also came with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v60-slowdown-bug">behind-the-scenes bugs</a> slowing down game performance that took Meta some time to update. On the more positive front, this update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-patches-quest-3-mic-issues-after-3-months">resolved longstanding mic issues</a> that plagued fans of social VR games. </p><p>With the February <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-62-update-spatial-video-gesture-controls">Quest v62 update</a> (Meta skipped v61), the Quest 3 made a ton of mixed-reality fixes and updates that seemed to directly target the recently-launched Apple Vision Pro, like support for iPhone 15 spatial videos and a pinch hand gesture. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg proved later that month that Meta had Apple on its mind, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-quest-3-better-product-period-than-vision-pro">"reviewing" the Apple Vision Pro</a> in a Threads video that bashed the rival headset and called the Quest 3 a "better product, period."</p><p>In March, Meta&apos;s CTO Andrew Bosworth started hinting about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-first-details">major Quest UI overhaul</a>, one that&apos;s yet to arrive. He hinted that it will provide a revamped keyboard and put a heavy emphasis on mixed reality, including stationary and pinned menus and apps.</p><p>Most recently, Meta unveiled a new AI-backed feature called SceneScript that will automatically map your room layout, including walls, doors, and furniture. It should make it a lot easier to play in different locations, without having to constantly redraw boundaries. </p>
<hr>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 costs $200 more than the Quest 2 did at launch. In exchange, it delivers significant visual, performance, and comfort upgrades across the board, maintains its wireless design despite the increased power demands, and adds mixed-reality apps. </p><p>Full-color mixed reality lets you tap out of games and clearly see your home space instead of a nauseating black-and-white blur. You can incorporate your surroundings <em>into</em> games like Supernatural, so you never need to worry about accidentally punching a wall. And some MR games make your physical space part of the experience. </p><p>We can assume that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> will take another few years to arrive, but we&apos;ve also heard rumblings about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Quest 3 Lite</a> with the same CPU but several major cuts to hit a $200 price tag, such as shipping without controllers. In theory, if the Quest 3 costs too much, you could wait for its cheaper sibling, so long as you&apos;re willing to accept the trade-offs. </p>

Instead of paying $15.99 every month for the popular Ad-Free plan, for instance, you could drop a single $110.99 payment and be streaming to your heart&apos;s content for an entire year. That particular plan also comes with the ability to download up to 30 titles for offline viewing. </p><p>Interested in the most premium streaming experience possible? The 42% off deal also applies to the Ultimate Ad-Free plan, which comes with everything mentioned above alongside 4K Ultra HD streaming on select titles, Dolby Atmos support, and up to 100 titles for offline enjoyment. Pay $139.99 during the promotional period (usually $19.99/month) and you&apos;ll get all of those goodies for an entire year. Max will even throw in the Sports Add-on for 100% free. It&apos;s the best streaming deal we&apos;ve seen in a long time, so don&apos;t miss your chance to save. </p>

<ul><li>Google Wallet has added a new verification settings menu for Android devices.</li><li>This setting allows users to decide whether or not they need to be verified before paying for a ticket on public transport.</li><li>This will help to make Google Wallet even more secure.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The ability to store card details, transit passes, boarding passes, and contactless payments, means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> is a convenient way to save time.  Now, Google is working hard to make Wallet even more secure and user-friendly by introducing a new ‘Verification settings’ menu.</p><p>The new addition, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/25/google-wallet-verification-settings/">9to5 Google</a>, lets users decide whether or not verification is required, specifically when paying for a transit ticket. Under “Wallet settings” is the new “Security” heading, under which “Verification settings” are listed. When selected, the user can “choose if you’ll need to verify it’s you when using your items stored in Wallet.” </p><p>At the moment, the only available option here is “Transit payments.” When the “verification required” toggle is on, Wallet will require “verification for paying for bus, metro, and more with a credit or debit card.” This means the usual options for a device include a PIN or fingerprint scan, for example.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="24RZvziPWUj2G9RkvaYvxc" name="Google-Wallet-verification-settings.jpg" alt="Screenshots of the new verification settings menu in Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/24RZvziPWUj2G9RkvaYvxc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Phone Arena)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If a user already has a transit pass stored in Wallet, the toggle will be switched on by default. The wallet will then require verification before paying with their bank card. If no transit pass is stored, this option will be automatically turned off. </p><p>This means that anyone without a transit pass can quickly pay for their ticket without needing to verify themselves. Users can, however, switch it on even if they don’t have a transit pass if they want that added security.</p>
<p>Importantly, this feature is only applicable to paying for transit. As it says underneath the toggle: “You’ll still verify for all other payments with this card.” This means that even if you disable the setting, it won’t allow someone to swipe your phone and go wild with your credit card. Although, they may get to enjoy a day out on your local metro system.</p><p>The new setting is available in version 24.10 of Google Wallet. It’s another example of how Google is trying to strike a balance between security and convenience on Google Wallet. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">A recent change</a> for some European users where all transactions now require verification (previously, unlocks weren’t always required for small payments) has met a mixed response. Hopefully, this latest update will be a little less controversial.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following instructions were performed on a Samsung Galaxy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. The steps might be slightly different depending on your device and Android version.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Wallpaper and style</strong>.</p><p>3. Choose the <strong>Color palette</strong> option.</p><p>4. Toggle on the <strong>Color palette</strong> option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.33%;"><img id="He34sXMiFZZQMHJBiLLS3o" name="Google-Messages-Settings.jpg" alt="Wallpaper and style option in Samsung phone settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/He34sXMiFZZQMHJBiLLS3o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2340" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Choose your new color from the Wallpaper colors or Basic colors option. You can&apos;t choose the colors in the Wallpaper colors option since the choices are limited to the wallpaper. The Basic color options give you solid or two color options.</p><p>When you know what color you want to use, tap the Apply button at the bottom. The colors will be applied, and you&apos;ll return to the Wallpaper and style section.</p><p>The steps will be slightly different depending on your phone. For example, for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, the steps would be <strong>Settings > Wallpaper > Change Wallpaper</strong> and choose your new wallpaper that has your preferred color. Depending on the Motorola phone, you may also find this in the <strong>Personalize</strong> option in the settings menu, which gives you the option to adjust the color palete separate from the wallpaper.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> and Pixel devices have fewer steps since you only need to tap on <strong>Wallpaper and Style</strong> to see the option. Repeat the same steps when you&apos;re ready to change the color again.</p><p>As long as you&apos;re on your Galaxy phone, whether it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> or not, you <strong>can also use Accessibility</strong> to change the colors of the text bubbles for Google Messages. It won&apos;t give it a drastic change, but it&apos;s another option. To give it a try:</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Vision enhancements</strong> (or <strong>Color and motion</strong> on Pixels and other Android phones) option.</p><p>4. Choose <strong>Color correction</strong> and <strong>toggle on</strong> the option at the top.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.33%;"><img id="X6DpyVawh6ZhzCtQkaJCLn" name="Vision-enhancements-settings.jpg" alt="Vision enhancement option in Galaxy settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X6DpyVawh6ZhzCtQkaJCLn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2340" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Choose a color option at the bottom and preview your option in the image above with all the veggies.</p><p>Another option would be to choose <strong>Color inversion</strong> instead of Color correction in the above steps. These two options can be accessed following the same steps.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Vision enhancements</strong> and swipe down a little to access the Color inversion option. </p><p>You can enable the Color inversion option directly from Vision enhancements. However, if you select it, you&apos;ll see an option to create a shortcut for this feature. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.33%;"><img id="R4sXpyzy3Wj4sVURoRSKQd" name="Vision-enhancements-options.jpg" alt="Vision enhancement options in Galaxy phone settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R4sXpyzy3Wj4sVURoRSKQd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2340" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> will also give the Google Messages bubble a different look. If you want to give it a try, you can enable it by:</p><p>1. Opening <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Go to <strong>Display</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Dark</strong> option at the top.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-change-text-bubble-colors-for-individual-rcs-chats-2">How to change text bubble colors for individual RCS chats</h2>
<p>With Google Messages, the ability to change the text bubble color of individual chats is also rolling out, although its availability is currently limited since it&apos;s in beta. That said, the steps for RCS (Rich Communication Services) chats are easy and quick for anyone currently in the beta:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open the chat</strong> to which you want to give a new color.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>dots</strong> at the top right.</p><p>3. Choose the <strong>Change Color</strong> option. </p><p>4. <strong>Select a color</strong> and tap <strong>Confirm</strong> at the bottom right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1238px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.26%;"><img id="wTBxSCeuY6gaxArsPsUfbd" name="RCS-Messages-Text-Bubbles.jpg" alt="Color change for RCS chats on Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTBxSCeuY6gaxArsPsUfbd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1238" height="845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A notice at the bottom will tell you so when you change the color. Each <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> chat can have a different color, and you can go back at any time to choose another color. The color change should also apply to the receiver but don&apos;t worry if that is not always the case since it&apos;s still in beta.</p>
<h2 id="make-your-google-messages-text-bubbles-colorful-2">Make your Google Messages text bubbles colorful</h2>
<p>Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/7-new-messages-features/">seven new features</a> in late 2023 that will change how you use Google Messages. One of those changes is Custom Bubbles, which allows you to change the color of your conversation right from the chat. The changes don&apos;t end there; you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-pin-up-to-five-conversations">pin up to five messages</a>. </p><p>There are many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">tips and tricks for Google Messages</a> you can try. It&apos;s great to see how users get more options regarding their conversations. Only time will tell what other great features you will enjoy.</p>

Meta had a huge presence at the event, as did Quest 3 developers showing off their upcoming virtual- and mixed-reality titles. And while Apple was a no-show, plenty of developers had their Vision Pros on hand to show off prototypes of their upcoming games.</p><p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> has been out for about half a year, developers are still figuring out its evolving mixed-reality technology. I met many developers still working on unfinished prototypes, scoping out GDC to compare notes with fellow developers.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/vision-pro">Vision Pro</a>, meanwhile, has gotten a handful of developers on board, but Apple itself hasn&apos;t provided much support; several devs told me they&apos;re waiting to see if it&apos;s worth investing in Apple&apos;s ecosystem.</p><p>From show floor demos of recently-launched games to private demos of upcoming titles to watch out for, these are the best Meta Quest and Vision Pro games I had a chance to try out at GDC 2024 — games I think you should keep an eye out for!</p>
<h2 id="laser-dance-2">Laser Dance</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0UowL5cjhaI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I spent about 45 minutes in line with Laser Dance creator Thomas van Bouwel at the Meta booth at GDC, chatting about his mixed-reality game. I&apos;m proud to say that I didn&apos;t let a single laser hit me as I snuck, crawled, and sidled through laser traps.</p><p>The game, which will remind you of Mission Impossible or Ocean&apos;s 12, has you sneaking through increasingly convoluted laser traps through your living room to reach a button on the far wall. If a laser hits you, the grid shuts down, and a ghost appears, showing where the laser struck you on your body, so you know what you did wrong.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4C3DWmNJftFamFUhCsikoL" name="GDC-2024-laser-dance.jpeg" alt="Michael Hicks crawling on the ground playing Laser Dance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4C3DWmNJftFamFUhCsikoL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Me, crawling under the lasers </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Laser Dance incorporates new Meta mixed-reality tools like dynamic occlusion, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-upper-body-tracking-motion-sickness">inside-out upper body tracking</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-aria-automatic-room-mapping">automatic room mapping</a>, and has accessibility settings that take body size and your ability to crawl into account. In other words, it&apos;s meant for almost anyone to play anywhere; van Bouwel says it&apos;s almost <em>better</em> to have a furniture-filled space for Laser Dance than an empty one.</p><p>While the varied layouts make global leaderboards hard to implement, van Bouwel says people will want to race their times after they finish the initial campaign. I&apos;m curious how long the game will be when it launches in 2024, as I sped through the demo very quickly, but my short time with it has already made Laser Dance a day-one buy for me!</p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Due out sometime in 2024; you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSgkpaUPBO99MIWwxNoDqNQgGeau0F-VfdEAiZGouS1xWCCw/viewform">sign up for playtesting</a> if you want to try it now. </p>
<h2 id="vrider-2">VRider</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twdpR9dDbFw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The first words that popped into my mind after playing VRider were "Forza but for motorcycles." I don&apos;t know enough about the Superbike World Championships to recognize the 23 real-life racers included or judge the fidelity of the 12 official circuits and bike designs recreated from Ducati, BMW, Honda, Yamaha, and Kawasaki. But it&apos;s clear the Funny Tales devs I met at GDC are passionate about the sport, and it translated in my demo.</p><p>Quest 2 or 3 owners will hold their Touch controllers in front of them like handlebars and tilt their bodies to turn, with colorful arrows guiding you on the right speed and angle for your turn. VRAL Games is also selling an official accessory that lets you mount your controllers so you can turn them like an actual throttle. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="Hzin2gHSvgh3cwdfoat6B6" name="vrider-gdc-2024-demo.jpeg" alt="The author playing VRider at GDC 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hzin2gHSvgh3cwdfoat6B6.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I quickly fell behind the nine AI racers as I learned the ropes, but the controls feel very intuitive, and I can imagine how fun it&apos;ll be to start learning the ins and outs of each track as you optimize your time. And even though I <em>looked </em>like a hunchback as I leaned into curves with my head behind the windshield, I <em>felt</em> extremely aerodynamic and speedy.</p><p>Even though Laser Dance was my favorite overall experience, I suspect I&apos;m more likely to spend a lot of time in VRider as I race other players in multiplayer or tournaments or challenge the ghosts of other players&apos; top times. Even if you&apos;re not into 2D racing games, I bet you&apos;ll enjoy this version more! Keep in mind that you&apos;ll need some decent VR legs to prevent motion sickness. </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Currently in closed beta, we will have an App Lab launch soon, then an official Quest Store launch in the summer, and a SteamVR launch later in 2024. </p>
<h2 id="game-room-2">Game Room</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3cR3_SE2s8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Resolution Games booth showed off demos for Racket Club and a mixed-reality update to Angry Birds VR, both of which are already on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>. I love Racket Club for how it challenges your reflexes and gets you sweating while offering mixed reality so I don&apos;t smash my hand into a wall. Unfortunately, a months-old game doesn&apos;t really fit on this list, so I&apos;ll focus instead on Game Room on the Apple Vision Pro, which launched this month.</p><p>Playing chess, solitaire, Battleship, and other beloved classics on the Vision Pro reminded me of my early days of computers when I&apos;d challenge the chess CPU or play Minesweeper non-stop. Resolution Games didn&apos;t reinvent the wheel with Game Room, but it has that same early-day vibe when you&apos;re just getting used to the controls and enjoying some simple pleasures.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gqYUbTosYn8xxqzXFrMoVN" name="GDC-2024-apple-vision-pro-resolution-games.jpeg" alt="The author wearing the Apple Vision Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqYUbTosYn8xxqzXFrMoVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since people are buying the Vision Pro to presumably wear for hours a day as they work, Game Room feels like the perfect kind of game to step away from the productivity apps for ten minutes, instead of sinking an hour into streaming Disney+ or whatever. Plus, it&apos;s a great game to introduce family members and friends to the Vision Pro because you can play against them using your iPhone or iPad. </p><p>Given that Vision Pro&apos;s gaming library is pretty weak at the moment, it&apos;s nice to see Resolution Games swooping in to entertain Apple fans. I&apos;m curious to see if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/demeo-hands-on">Demeo</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/dungeons-and-dragons-officially-coming-to-vr">upcoming licensed Dungeons & Dragons game</a> will come to Vision Pro next. (Not that I can afford the headset, but people who spent $3,500 deserve fun options besides iPad apps!) </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Available to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-room/id1642897935" target="_blank">here</a>. Racket Club can be purchased on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6022041731249559/">Quest Store</a>. </p>
<h2 id="mega-fireball-2">Mega Fireball</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKLRUUT9u9g?start=17" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Lucky Juicebox, former Niantic engineers who formed their own MR studio, let me try a demo of their 2024 release Mega Fireball in an empty hallway at Moscone Center at GDC 2024. Essentially, it&apos;s a local multiplayer experience where you control a tiny cartoonish animal that tries to knock a soccer ball into a goal. </p><p>What made the demo exciting was that it took my surroundings into account. The hallway was mostly empty, but I could still have my character jump onto water fountains and fountains or wall-jump off ofwalls. In an actual living room, you&apos;ll have your character jumping on tables or couches, and your shots on goal will get blocked by furniture, too. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zeWkLkVv7ZxFhPJyQsKnkV" name="GDC-2024-lucky-juicebox.jpeg" alt="The Lucky Juicebox devs at GDC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zeWkLkVv7ZxFhPJyQsKnkV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Lucky Juicebox devs </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lucky Juicebox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not sure how often two people with Quest 3s will get together in one place, but the devs talked about their hopes of letting games like Mega Fireball use the "mesh" layout of different players&apos; rooms so that you can combine two geographically separate rooms into one playspace. It&apos;s actually the same idea that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/games/virtual-reality/gdc-2024-schell-games-mixed-reality-killer-apps">major VR dev proposed would be a "killer app" for mixed reality</a>.</p><p>They also mentioned that they want to turn Mega Fireball into a "sandbox" where players can create their own MR games or activities using the physics, mechanics, and assets they built. As an example, they described how they made an "action movie" by taking their characters to a local park and recording their characters&apos; movements and attacks there.</p><p>Even though Lucky Juicebox clearly wants to make a Pokemon Go-like experience that would rely on fully augmented-reality glasses you can wear anywhere, that probably won&apos;t happen for a few years, and I&apos;m excited to see what else they do with mixed reality in the meantime. </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Out sometime in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="mlb-home-run-derby-vr-2">MLB Home Run Derby VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV5Dy1Tnxe4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I&apos;m limited in terms of what I can say about the new Quest port of MLB Home Run Derby VR, which launches on March 28, beyond what was initially announced on March 6. I did try an early build during GDC, however, and I&apos;ll simply point out that I&apos;m including it in this round-up without any other commentary until after the embargo.</p><p>Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/nfl-pro-era-review">NFL Pro Era</a>, it&apos;s an officially licensed title with 30 MLB stadiums, achievements, tournaments, and the chance to progress from a single-A minor leaguer to a major-league superstar. You don&apos;t get the full MLB experience like pitching or fielding, but you do get to practice swinging for the fences!</p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Out March 28, available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/4468078983226058" target="_blank">Meta Quest</a>.</p>
<h2 id="half-life-2-vr-2">Half-Life 2 VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-08KCheaGg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I&apos;m <em>definitely</em> cheating for this pick, as the fantastic Half-Life 2 VR mod has been available for a couple of years now on SteamVR. But the process of booting up my PC, Steam Link, and Virtual Desktop, then tinkering with the settings, makes PC VR too much of a hassle for me most of the time. I&apos;d rather dive right into my Quest library. </p><p>So why bring it up? Because this week, Impact Reality announced a new publishing initiative called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/flat2vr-studios-hires-talented-vr-modders-for-licensed-quest-ports">Flat2VR Studios</a> that&apos;s working on licensed VR ports for various headsets, including the Quest 3. </p><p>The modders on that team have made unofficial VR ports of classic titles like Half-Life 2, Tomb Raider, Jedi Knight II: Outcast, and Doom, as well as more recent games like Neon White and Outer Wilds. You had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest">sideload on your Quest</a> to play them, but now, these future licensed titles will be available through the main storefront.</p><p>So far, the team only has one unannounced port in the works. But when I met the kind Flat2VR Studios folks at their GDC booth, they hinted that they&apos;d had some productive conversations with gaming publishers over the last few days and explained that access to a game&apos;s source code would allow them to make much better VR ports than they could do in the past with modding and workarounds. </p><p>My hope is that the Quest 3 (and other headsets) will become a great place to play classic PC titles in the future. </p>
<h2 id="runaways-2">Runaways</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2758px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.91%;"><img id="BbLTzxJKSJnZbnLjwPEPc7" name="Runaways-promo-image.jpg" alt="Runaways press promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BbLTzxJKSJnZbnLjwPEPc7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2758" height="1542" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Beyond)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out my GDC 2024 list of upcoming VR games is this adorable endless runner from New Zealand dev team Beyond, designed for the Apple Vision Pro. You play as Hank — an rebellious alien escaping from an evil tentacled overlord&apos;s planet through a portal — who must leap over obstacles to get as far away as possible. </p><p>Runaways definitely has the vibe of a mobile game in mixed-reality form, with the pinch motion to jump replacing the tap of a display. But just like Game Room, Runaways is the kind of cute, casual escapism that Vision Pro users will want when it launches in April. </p>
<p>The escape track randomly changes with each run. In addition to jumping over track gaps and traps, there&apos;s a trap-disabling button to safely pass through them—except some traps are disabled by default, so you may accidentally kill yourself by activating one if you&apos;re not careful. If you get far enough, you&apos;ll also have to dodge tentacles.</p><p>I love that the game will come with comic books that you unlock by getting far enough away with different characters. Their aesthetic evokes classic comic books, and the story will encourage you to keep improving your high score to unlock new chapters. </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Launches on Apple Vision Pro in April.</p>

<p>If you look at the full list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming announced Quest games</a>, I&apos;ve only scratched the surface. Many VR devs didn&apos;t make it to GDC, and I couldn&apos;t make appointments with everyone. But there&apos;s plenty to be excited about as a VR or MR fan in 2024. </p><p>It was my first experience with the Apple Vision Pro, and I enjoyed my brief window with it! But it&apos;s also clear that most developers are treating it as a novelty due to the smaller install base. Apple doesn&apos;t seem to have the same rigid restrictions and hoops Meta has to get on the Quest Store, but it also doesn&apos;t offer the same gaming support.</p><p>On the flip side, even though the Quest 2 remains more popular than the Quest 3, developers seemed more willing to experiment with mixed-reality functions that only really work on the newer headset. Resolution Games, for instance, told me that half of Demeo players use MR mode over VR mode, while slightly less do so for Racket Club. It&apos;s clear that VR gamers want to see their surroundings, at least sometimes.</p><p>Also, since the cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Quest 3 Lite</a> allegedly will have full-color passthrough when it launches later this year, that makes it more likely that more gamers will use mixed-reality tech moving forward. I&apos;m hoping that means we&apos;ll see more games like Laser Dance in the near future!</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s new lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, the Galaxy S24 series, came with a slew of new artificial intelligence features. These are slated to make their way to Galaxy devices released in 2023 with the One UI 6.1 update. Samsung previously said that the One UI 6.1 update would be available in March 2024, and time is running out for the company to meet that self-imposed deadline. However, signs are pointing to a release of One UI 6.1 this week. </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1771404869775278287" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Tarun Vats shared a notification from Samsung that stated OneUI 6.1 would roll out in China starting March 28 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/25/samsung-one-ui-6-1-update-release-date-rumor/">9to5Google</a>). The notification is fairly specific, covering the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus, and S23 Ultra. Besides being limited to those devices, it explicitly confirms the release date for users in China, not the rest of the world. However, it&apos;s reasonable to expect that One UI 6.1 will debut this week in other regions. </p>

<p>Samsung first shipped the One UI 6.1 update as the day-one software for the Galaxy S24 series. It includes the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI suite</a> of AI-enhanced software features, and users quickly speculated whether these tools would come to older phones. Later, the company confirmed that Galaxy AI features would be available on Galaxy devices released in 2023. For now, the prior Galaxy S22 series from 2022 is left out, but that could change.</p><p>It seems that Samsung will start the One UI 6.1 rollout with the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus, and S23 Ultra devices. However, the company has confirmed that the Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, and Tab S9 series will get One UI 6.1 as well. Based on Samsung&apos;s system notification to users in China, the rollout will likely begin with the Galaxy S23 series and appear on other Galaxy devices from 2023 in the days and weeks to follow. </p><p>Owners of the Galaxy S23 series should be on the lookout for an update this week, although it isn&apos;t guaranteed. Users of the Galaxy S22 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">still have a glimmer of hope for getting Galaxy AI</a>, but that would be far out — if it even happens. </p>
