<p>The Garmin Forerunner 955 may seem like old news now that the 965 has come along, but it's still one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a> on the market, with up to 15 days of battery life, 32GB of storage, and all of the mapping tools and training data you could ever need.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a runner or cyclist looking for personalized guidance and comprehensive data from your smartwatch; you don&apos;t mind buying last year&apos;s fitness watch. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford the Garmin Forerunner 965; you want a watch with an AMOLED display. </p><p>As we noted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">our glowing Forerunner 955 review</a> over a year ago, the Garmin watch impresses by providing an incredible amount of fitness data for runners in particular, with loads of personalized reports and Training Readiness calculations, super-accurate GNSS tracking with full-color mapping, and days upon days of battery life. </p><p>Sure, the newer Forerunner 965 is arguably a better watch than its predecessor (if you can afford it), but if you want deeply comprehensive running data for less than $500, this is the deal for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>With Google I/O hours away, a few images supposedly depicting the upcoming Pixel 9 series have leaked.</p><p>The set of images was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rozetked.me/news/33304-eksklyuziv-fotografii-vseh-modeley-google-pixel-9-ot-rozetked">Rozetked</a> (Russian), supposedly depicting an array of live photos for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 XL (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/mmassive-live-photo-leak-pixel-9-series/">Android Police</a>). Specifications about the devices suggest the base model will sport a 6.2-inch display, the Pro may have a 6.3-inch display, and the 9 XL could see a 6.7-inch screen.</p><p>The publication, which cites an anonymous source, says the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are the "same size." However, the devices differ in their bezels, as the base model supposedly sports thicker ones compared to the Pro edition.</p><p>The leak continues to say that the displays for the entire 9 series can reach a 120Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>The alleged live photos give us a much cleaner look at the Pixel 9 series&apos; back panel. The series has been rumored to boast a design change where the camera visor no longer stretches the span of the panel horizontally. These speculated live photos double down on those past rumors, which makes the phones feel more like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p><p>The base model&apos;s camera specs are light, as the publication states it will offer 0.5x and 1x zoom. The Pro and XL models are said to deliver three 50MP cameras with 0.5x, 1x, and 5x zoom capabilities. Additionally, both the higher-end models could debut with UWB support.</p><p>Internally, the Pixel 9 could arrive with a RAM/storage configuration of 12/128GB. The Pro and XL could both feature 16/128GB setups. The entire series is expected to rock the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">Tensor G4</a>, as well. The leak adds that the base Pixel 9 could feature a glossy back panel with "matte frames." This is reportedly different than the Pixel 9 Pro, which will offer a matte back with "glossy frames."</p>

<p>The latest wave of live photos joins <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-pixel-9-pro-live-photos-surface">an earlier look from April</a> at the Pixel 9 Pro. It was previously rumored that the device would sport a 6.1-inch display, though that&apos;s seemingly not the case now as speculation floats a 6.3-inch display onto the table.</p><p>More importantly, after some rendering confusion, the idea of a potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">Pixel 9 XL</a> was theorized in March. The device will reportedly take the cake as the largest in the upcoming series with a 6.7-inch display instead of the previously rumored 6.5-inch screen.</p><p>Google is preparing to host its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">I/O 2024</a> event tomorrow, May 14, at 10 am PT. The event should hold a few surprises for us and maybe even a proper look at the Pixel 9 series that&apos;s on its way for a fall debut.</p>

<ul><li>Google already has a partnership with iFixit and Pixel products are given an internal Design for Serviceability Scorecard. </li><li>However, in a Made by Google podcast, the company shared its long-term goal of making Pixel devices more repairable. </li><li>Google wants everything you need to repair your device to be available in your "kitchen drawer."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Right-to-repair is gaining traction, and Google has been a big part of that movement. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-begins-selling-official-googles-pixel-8-series-parts-and-tools-for-at-home-repairs">partnered with iFixit to offer parts, tools, and repair guides</a> for Pixel devices in 2022. Earlier this year, Google officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">backed the pending right-to-repair bill in Oregon</a>. Now, in the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast, the company elaborated on its plans for making Pixel phones and hardware easier to repair in the future. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shows.acast.com/made-by-google-podcast/episodes/663393aae9604e0012e05efe" target="_blank">podcast</a> featured an interview with Steven Nickel, who is the director of consumer hardware operations at Google. Part of Nickel&apos;s job is to make sure Pixel devices are designed with repairability in mind and to make sure post-sales support is offered to Pixel users. Nickel says he sought out leading right-to-repair initiatives at Google, and it&apos;s clear from the conversation that Nickel believes every Pixel user should be able to repair their devices. </p><p>"We want everyone to be able to do repairs," Nickel said plainly. As for how to reach that goal, he says part of it involves limiting the amount of glue used to seal Pixel phones. </p><p>"I remember going to our repair depot in Japan, and they had just outlined this process really effectively of how to take apart this device," Nickel recounted. "And they had done it by station. There was just one station that all they did was take out all of the glue and scrape it out of there."</p><p>Now, part of Google&apos;s internal process for improving Pixel repairability includes giving each device a "Design for Serviceability Scorecard." Nickel says the score always goes up with each Pixel phone generation, and that&apos;s intentional.</p>

<p>Google didn&apos;t restrict phone repairs to the parts of the world where Pixel devices are made, deviating from the industry norm, the company says. "It was pretty common back then, and still is, for manufacturers to want to do repair where [the devices] are manufactured," said Nickel. "That never made sense to us." </p><p>Finally, the long-term goal for Pixel repairability is to make fixing the devices a "fixture-less" repair. </p><p>"Fixtures are the tools you need to repair them," Nickel explains. "We want to get to a point where you can reach into a kitchen drawer and be able to replace your screen."</p><p>Google has certainly made progress with Pixel device repairability, but it&apos;s still far from achieving that vision. Currently, Pixel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> still require specialized opening tools and bits for repairs. The water seal used in water-resistant devices is a specific hurdle the industry appears to be struggling to overcome. However, this interview once again shows that Google is committed to the right-to-repair movement. </p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly experimenting with running ChromeOS on Android devices, though it's unclear if this functionality will ever come to market. </li><li>The company is said to have demoed ChromeOS on Android to its corporate partners at a private event.</li><li>ChromeOS was running on Android using the Android Virtualization Framework, according to the report, and only worked with phones connected to an external display. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Although Google has maintained that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chrome-os-m124-may-update-changes">ChromeOS</a> are two separate and distinct platforms over the years, they&apos;ve also grown closer together in some ways. For example, you can download and use Android apps within ChromeOS. In the future, the reverse might be true. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-running-on-pixel-3442496/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is toying with the idea of running ChromeOS on Android phones and has even recently demoed the functionality. </p><p>Previously, it was reported that Google was planning on developing a desktop-like environment for Android that would rival Samsung&apos;s DeX. It looks like another option for the company could be using the desktop operating system it already has—ChromeOS. There were calls by Android and ChromeOS fans to make the latter available on the former, and now there&apos;s a glimmer of hope that it could happen.</p><p>It&apos;s now possible to run ChromeOS on Android, at least internally at Google, due to a new Android feature called the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). This framework "provides secure and private execution environments for executing code," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/virtualization" target="_blank">Google&apos;s official documentation</a>. "AVF is ideal for security-oriented use cases that require stronger, even formally verified, isolation assurances over those offered by Android’s app sandbox."</p><p>The first real use case for AVF might come with the ability to run ChromeOS on Android. In fact, Android Authority says that Google is able to run Chromium OS — which is an open-source version of ChromeOS — on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> via this method. It has even shown off Chromium OS on Android devices to other manufacturers it is partnered with, the report says. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sCh2SmFJ6DPgDyiXwV5c9H" name="acer-chromebook-spin-513-2022-cog-running.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022) with Cog app running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCh2SmFJ6DPgDyiXwV5c9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The private event saw a Pixel 8 run a Chromium OS variant known as "ferrochrome." It was run using virtualization, which was made possible thanks to the AVF. This functionality also used an external display for Chromium OS output, taking advantage of the Pixel 8 series&apos; new support for display output. </p><p>It&apos;s still up in the air whether ChromeOS on Android will ever be something that leaves the walls of Google. It makes sense that Google would try this out, and it&apos;s reasonable to think that leveraging ChromeOS to offer a desktop environment for Android users is easier than building something from the ground up. Still, Google has maintained that ChromeOS and Android have not merged in the past, and we don&apos;t know whether VMs are something of interest to the company.</p>

<hr>
<p>Quite a substantial leak has surfaced regarding Motorola&apos;s upcoming flagship foldable smartphone.</p><p>Information has come to light via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-moto-razr-50-ultra-to-debut-as-razr-2024-in-the-us-check-detailed-specs-and-pricing/">SmartPrix</a> in conjunction with X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1789983910014628206">OnLeaks</a>, who state the Moto Razr 50 Ultra will be called the "Motorola Razr Plus 2024" in the U.S. For specifications, the clamshell is rumored to feature a 6.9-inch pOLED display internally, with a larger 3.9-inch cover display over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>It seems consumers are still in for a dual camera array, as the publication states that once it launches, a wide 50MP lens could be paired with a 50MP telephoto. The latter is said to offer 2x optical zoom, while its punch-hole selfie camera is rumored to arrive at 32MP.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s recent Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC is speculated to power the Moto Razr Plus 2024. This toned-down chip sits right under the flagship SD 8 Gen 3, though it clocks in at 3.0GHz. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14, </a>with an array of photo and video features powered by AI, is rumored for the device.</p><p>The leaks suggest other notable upgrades, beginning with the device&apos;s RAM. Supposedly, the Razr Plus 2024 will boast 12GB of RAM alongside 256GB of internal storage. Another improvement is rumored to arrive for its battery, as the tipster states the device could pick up a 4,000mAh battery.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! Today, I have the complete specs sheet as well as the US pricing of the #Motorola #Razr50Ultra (which will likely be marketed as "Razr+ 2024" in the US) to share with you! 😏On behalf of @Smartprix 👉🏻 https://t.co/7MTNBeLUut pic.twitter.com/IC7CpGnnGc<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1789983910014628206">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The good news here is that the latest leaks suggest that despite the upgrades, the Razr Plus 2024&apos;s price might not change. The device will allegedly hit the market with a $999 price tag, which is the same price that last year&apos;s model launched with, sporting 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>The post adds that Motorola is gearing up for a June launch for the foldable.</p><p>Last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Moto Razr Plus</a> debuted with the same internal display size; however, the latest rumors suggest we&apos;re looking for a slightly larger cover display. The device also debuted with a 3,800mAh battery with 8GB of RAM. With rumors suggesting an upgrade in both areas for (potentially) the same price, it looks like Motorola is staring down stronger competition with Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">Flip 6</a>.</p><p>Regarding pricing leaks, we heard three days ago that Motorola could keep its price similar — at least in Europe. It was purported that the device could feature a €1200 price tag, which closely matched what consumers in the region saw last year. With rumors now suggesting the same for the U.S. market, perhaps this rumor bears weight.</p><p>Additionally, the Razr Plus 2024 had a render leak back in January, which makes us think the device&apos;s design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-alleged-leaked-render">might not change</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, we expected to see Google introduce some new hardware at I/O 2024, namely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. However, it seems that the company had other ideas as the Pixel 8a has already been announced. </p><p>We&apos;re still working through our full review, but you can check out Nick&apos;s initial impressions <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review"><strong>here</strong></a>. In that same vein, Nick gives us his take as to whether you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">upgrade to the Pixel 8a</a>, or stick with last year&apos;s Pixel 7a. If you decide to take the plunge, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">Pixel 8a deals</a> to be found, and in some cases, you can even get Google&apos;s latest phone for free!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since we aren&apos;t expecting much on the hardware front, we have to assume that Google will put all (or most) of its focus on software. This includes things such as Gemini, and how Google plans to further integrate it into our daily lives.</p><p>However, it will be interesting to see if and how Google responds to OpenAI&apos;s introduction of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">GPT-4o model</a>. This new GPT model is capable of providing "reason across audio, vision, and text in real time." OpenAI showed off a few rather impressive demos and has already made GPT-4o available. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lots to look forward to @Google IO tomorrow 👀 pic.twitter.com/7HhIWwIlQv<a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1790059401044197468">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Although Google hasn&apos;t made any official announcements just yet, the company has started giving us a few teasers. One of which comes from Logan Kilpatrick, the "Lead Product for Google AI Studio." In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1790059401044197468">post on X</a>, Kilpatrick shares a conversation with a Pixel asking it "Hey, what do you think&apos;s happening here?"</p><p>What makes this exciting is that the conversation is being had while Gemini is using the rear camera to see what&apos;s being asked about. Gemini responds stating "It looks like people are setting up for a large event." Kilpatrick then asks "Those big pretty letters on screen, what do those mean." Gemini responds stating "Those letters represent Google I/O, a developer conference held by Google."</p><p>It&apos;s clear that the personal AI race is heating up, and while OpenAI might have seemingly taken a leap forward, Google isn&apos;t just going to sit idly by. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-fcc-certification-why-do-we-need-this-2">What is FCC certification? Why do we need this?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GvBTnuVSjvymoJSWiXyYHo" name="xiaomi-13-pro-5.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GvBTnuVSjvymoJSWiXyYHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dustin asks:</p><p><em><strong>Why do phone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, IQOO, etc. send their phones to the FCC for approval if they don&apos;t ultimately get released in the US?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a really good question, Dustin, thanks for asking. I think a lot of people will be interested in finding out what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-reaches-us-fcc-listing">FCC certification</a> is for and, of course, why companies get it even if they have no plans to sell products in the states. I know I was when I got your email!</p><p>As usual, I like to start with the easy answer and get it out of the way:</p>
<p>FCC certification (for phones and other wireless devices) makes sure the equipment doesn&apos;t interfere with other equipment. For approval, a manufacturer has to set specific limits on all radio signals — both intentional and unintentional — that can be sent out. Other tests do things like ensure the amount of radiation from a device isn&apos;t harmful, but the main goal of certification is to make sure a phone can&apos;t do something like mess with other equipment.</p><p>Any phone sold or marketed in the United States must get FCC approval for either commercial (Class A devices) or residential (Class B) use. If a device has the potential to emit radio signals, like for instance a microwave, it requires something similar known as a Supplier&apos;s Declaration of Conformity filed with the FCC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="87cq28PdnGdmwK7M9aDWa" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-1.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/87cq28PdnGdmwK7M9aDWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many phone manufacturers will also get FCC approval for devices they don&apos;t intend to sell in the U.S. As Dustin mentioned, it&apos;s common to see Xiaomi (for example) get a phone certified without any intention of selling it here.</p><p>Technically, these devices don&apos;t <em>have</em> to be certified, but doing so is a wise decision. It covers the manufacturer—and you—if you are using one in the U.S., regardless of whether or not it&apos;s sold here.</p>
<p>Thanks to the internet, it&apos;s fairly easy to get your hands on any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, even international ones, no matter where you live. A quick trip to Amazon will get you something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Ultra-256GB-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B0C6QK2QL8">Xiaomi Mi 13 Ultra</a>, and even though it&apos;s a Chinese phone built for the Chinese market, it will work in many places in the States, too.</p><p>Not a lot of people are doing this. There&apos;s no guarantee it will work in your area because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/5g">network support</a>, there is no warranty, and buying it is only half the solution; even after the language is set to English or Spanish, much of the phone is still in Mandarin until a different OS is flashed to the device. It&apos;s easier to buy a phone officially sold in the U.S.</p>

<p>We aren&apos;t most people. If you read about Android or smartphones on the internet, you&apos;re at least a partial nerd, and that&apos;s not a bad thing 😉. A lot of us would love to have some of these phones, even with the extra hurdles to jump through. I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-ultra-global-review">Xiaomi Mi 13 Ultra</a> as an example because I would love to have one!</p><p>So, let&apos;s pretend I did shell out the money to import one into my nerdly hands. I certainly want to make sure that it can&apos;t interfere with other devices while I&apos;m using it. Imagine the horror of my phone messing with equipment at a hospital or even causing problems with a TV signal or a Citizen&apos;s Band radio.</p>
<p>This means more than having regrets. You are going to be held financially responsible — the feds take this seriously. So is the manufacturer.</p><p>Xiamoi gets the device FCC certified as a way to cover its own ass, and inadvertently it covers yours, too. the company knows that people with this phone will vacation in the U.S. and that people in the U.S. will buy the product even though it&apos;s not "marketed or sold" in the United States officially.</p>
<p>Government involvement and regulations can be silly, mired in red tape, and often overstep their bounds. In this case, I think what the FCC does — something similar is done in most countries around the world — is a necessary evil. But so is companies getting the certification for products they don&apos;t intend to sell in the U.S.</p>

<ul><li>Meta announced the launch of "Travel Mode" for the Quest 2 and Quest 3.</li><li>Travel Mode is designed to give VR users a chance to enjoy entertainment, games, mediation apps, and more while in-flight.</li><li>Meta also announced its pilot program with Lufthansa, which will give Business Class Suite customers an array of unique content with the Quest 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta announces a new feature for its Quest devices that might make airline travel a little more enjoyable.</p><p>According to a press release, Meta&apos;s CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that a "Travel Mode" is on its way to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> VR headsets. In an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/travel-mode-lufthansa-airplane-flight-entertainment/">blog post</a>, the new mode turns the headsets into the "ultimate in-flight entertainment device." If Wi-Fi is available for everyone, Meta states the Quest should prompt you to join it while automatically launching its browser to begin browsing and watching videos.</p><p>Meta adds that this Travel Mode should give some folks a more comfortable time getting work done as it creates a private space. Games, meditation apps, and more will become available, as well.</p><p>The post adds that both VR headsets utilize a new Meta algorithm for Travel Mode that helps keep what you see stable. More importantly, a user&apos;s VR viewing pleasure should remain consistent even when gazing out the window.</p><p>The Quest 2 and Quest 3&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/travel-mode/?intern_source=blog&intern_content=travel-mode-lufthansa-airplane-flight-entertainment">Travel Mode</a> is an opt-in feature. To do so, Meta states users need to hop into <strong>Settings > Experimental features </strong>to get started. Users must restart their Quest after opting into the experimental features. Then, the Travel Mode will appear as a toggleable option in Quick Settings.</p><p>Meta states that both headsets should begin to sense when the user is on a plane automatically and offer to launch Travel Mode. The company plans to add support for trains in the future.</p>

<p>The other side of this Meta Quest update is the company&apos;s pilot program with Lufthansa. Both companies are preparing to outfit a "select number" of flights packed with Lufthansa Allegris Business Class Suite customers. The goal is to offer a range of "custom" MR content that spans entertainment, travel, wellness, games, and more.</p><p>Meta states that all of this is optimized and should work well with the Quest 3&apos;s Travel Mode capabilities.</p><p>Meta and Lufthansa explain that Business Class Suite customers will soon find an "immersive" cinema experience through the Quest 3 for movies and TV shows. Podcasts should also become more immersive as the device&apos;s VR capabilities and spatial video, alongside "select" 360-degree video content. Additionally, features and content are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Discover travel destinations from a bird’s-eye view with virtual sightseeing previews before you arrive</li><li>Play interactive games like Connect Four and Chess</li><li>Relax with active meditation exercises or enjoy a passive, lean-back experience</li></ul>

There are DACs in this list for every budget and every level of sophistication. From the casual listener to the enthusiast, (GASP!) even a neophyte “audiophile,” we have something for you here. These are the best DACs for your Android-based audio enjoyment. Whether it’s a tablet, smartphone, or Chromebook, we’ve got you covered.</p><p>To fully experience the enhanced audio qualities these DACs offer your phone or tablet, you’ll need an app like Neturon Player or USB Player Pro (my favorite) to bypass an Android limitation. Google’s OS downsamples USB-C output to 16bit/44.1kHz or CD quality, but with the proper setup, you can unlock the full potential of high-resolution audio. We know that hi-res&apos;s “full potential” is somewhat controversial, but we’ll save that for another article. Let’s dive into these DACs!</p>

<p>Yes, this is an Android fan site. No, there are not many super basic dongle DACs available for $9 that offer quality audio output that works for whatever your mobile OS is. All you need is that USB-C port and headphones with a 3.5mm male cable or adapter for your larger connectors and you’re good to go. This one has been around for years and is tried, true, and tested ad nauseam by the snootiest audiophiles on the planet, so it should be good enough for us mere mortals, right? Right.</p></p>

<p>If you have some pricey in-ear monitors or over-ear headphones, you may need more power to drive them, and if you’re on a budget, that’s where the excellent FiiO KA11 comes in. It has a neutral sound, no companion app, and if you’re into numbers you should know that the power I spoke of comes in the form of 245mW of power at 16Ω. Available in silver and black, the compact but sturdy metal build means you can toss it in a bag and go without worry. If you find that the Apple dongle requires you to push the audio level to the max with the headphones or IEMs you’re using, the KA11 is the upgrade you need.</p></p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Best phone-powered compact MQA DAC</strong></em></p>
<p>THX Onyx is a THX-certified AAA DAC with a high voltage output whose ability to drive headphones and IEMs is immediately noticeable if you’re upgrading from something like the Apple dongle. It’s also certified to play MQA files from Tidal and has a handy set of LEDs so that you know what level of files you’re decoding. The build quality of the metal frame is excellent, and the cable management via magnets is a delightful touch. The sound is warm with a large soundstage, but the device is very efficient with a lower power draw than others in this class. This means it won’t kill your phone’s battery while attached and in use.</p></p>

<p>This DAC/AMP blew my mind the first time I used it with my Sennheiser HD 660S2’s connected to it. It’s self-powered by a 450mAh battery, so it has impressive on-device controlled volume to the 3.5mm SE or 4.4mm balanced outputs. Connect to it via USB-C, or Bluetooth while supporting a variety of Hi-Res Wireless Audio Bluetooth codecs. You'll even have the ability to update to future codecs over the air. Best of all, it has three EQ presets that add warmth, increase the soundstage, or a mix of both via analog circuitry and not DSP. Did I mention that it's one of the best-looking DACs in this roundup?</p></p>

<p>This DAC/AMP is similar to the iFi GO blu, minus the alluring industrial design, but it makes up for that with a companion app fit for serious audiophiles. There’s a deep set of features in that app, including a fully decked-out parametric EQ. Seriously! Steep learning curve ahead if you’re new to the world of “coloring” your audio, playing with gain, power output and so much more. It'll take time, but if you're into shaping your sound, it's worth it!</p></p>

<p>The iFi Zen DAC 3 is the third generation of iFi’s highly lauded, somewhat portable desktop DAC. This is for those of you who want something at home, or to take to the office in your backpack. Connect to your tablet or Chromebook- or Mac, or Windows machines! There’s a Burr-Brown True Native chipset onboard, so file formats are rendered “bit-perfect.” If you have open-back headphones and feel they’re a little light on the bass, TrueBass enhances bass output via analog circuitry, without DSP in the mix. Power it via USB-C, or use 5V DC and get cleaner, more powerful sound reproduction. Being a desktop DAC/AMP, you get 4.4mm balanced and unbalanced 6.3mm and RCA outputs.</p></p>

<p>The most expensive DAC on the list, FiiO’s K19 is for serious audio lovers! This desktop DAC/AMP features beautiful aluminum honeycomb side paneling, but the attention to detail and connectivity options are what impressed us the most besides the sound. The front has 6.35mm, 4.4mm, 4-pin XLR ports, and a USB-C port. On the rear, you can connect to AC or DC power with a switch to select which one. Also on the rear are 3-pin XLRs, RCA ports with dust covers, optical in/out, coaxial in/out, and USB-C in. You can even use the K19 with TVs and gaming consoles thanks to the HDMI in and HDMI ARC out ports. The bundled IR remote control is a nice touch, but you can also access all of the features via the FiiO Control app.</p></p>

<p>This relatively inexpensive DAC is unique on this list due to its ability to double as a digital audio player, or DAP. It features a beautiful metal design with a tiny 1.54-inch LCD, and is available in red, green, or black colorways. What makes this such a worthy DAC is its dual ESS chips, allowing for balanced output if you buy the optional 3.5mm to 4.4mm connector. Aside from that you also get a large 650mAh battery capable of 14.5 hours of playback. This DAP/DAC works via Bluetooth and USB-C and has a microSD slot supporting up to 2TB of storage for offline music listening.</p></p>

<p>Get off my lawn!! I want my LG V60 ThinkQ 5G back! Unlike the majority of today’s phones, this one had a 3.5mm port built-in, AS WELL AS a Quad DAC. You can still find these refurbished and unlocked on Amazon, and you’ll get a competent smartphone that could be your highly capable “iPod Touch” at a price comparable with many of the products on this list. Think about it… you can use WiFi to connect to all of your favorite streaming apps. Use onboard storage for offline music playback. And if you need a backup phone, BOOM! Look no further. It’s like a Swiss Army DAP! You’re welcome.</p></p>

<h2 id="before-you-buy-that-dac-know-this-2">Before you buy that DAC, know this...</h2>
<figure><blockquote><p>Imagine me on a rooftop, shouting; your DAC won’t matter if your headphones or IEMs are trash. Just like you can’t outwork a bad diet in the gym, you can’t outperform poor-performing headphones or IEMs in your DAC purchase. But no worry—we have you covered there as well.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You can check out Harish’s review of some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wired-earbuds-are-making-a-comeback-and-im-excited">best IEMs your hard-earned dollars</a> can buy. Or you can peruse our selection of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>, many of which you can connect via 3.5mm cable to one of the DACs on this list. For example, Sennheiser’s Momentum 4s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/do-listeners-really-care-about-hi-res-audio">sound excellent paired with iFi’s GO blu DAC/AMP</a>.</p><p>The next thing you need to know is that pairing a good pair of headphones or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">IEMs</a> with a DAC is like pairing beverages with food; some go better together than others. Part of the fun for some people is the exploration, so you’ll have to try out the headphones that have caught your attention with the DAC you can afford or want to try and see how they sound. Some people will buy a couple DACs at a time and trial things, then return the one they don’t want or sell it. </p><p>One feature I want to take a moment to clarify, if you haven’t had much experience with headphones and DACs is the 4.4mm (or XLR) balanced output. It’s really simple, actually. A DAC with <strong>balanced output</strong> sends signal/power to both the left and right audio channels independently from two separate DAC chips, unlike one with <strong>unbalanced output </strong>(also referred to as &apos;single-ended&apos; or &apos;SE&apos;), which sends power to both left and right channels from a single source. You’ll immediately notice more volume (turn it down when going balanced), and greater bass detail. If you’re in an environment with a lot of electromagnetic interference, you’ll also have less “noise” in your audio. If you have a pair of high-quality headphones that support balanced audio and you have the budget, you should definitely be looking at one of those DACs for Android.</p><p>If your “audiophile” experience isn’t extensive, any item on this list beyond the Apple adapter will be a noticeable upgrade from what you’ve been listening to. So, sit back, relax, press play, and lose yourself in immersive sound.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is working on bringing its Project Starline solution to everyday platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a> and Zoom for a more lifelike video conferencing experience.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-project-starline-hp-partnership/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it is partnering with HP to bring the 3D video call platform to market in 2025. Plus, it is working on making it compatible with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-video-conference-software">favorite video conferencing services</a> so you can ditch the flat screen.</p><p>In 2021, Google started working on Project Starline, a teleconferencing setup where you see a 3D model of the person you&apos;re talking to, complete with all their gestures and expressions, making it feel like you&apos;re actually in the same room. It&apos;s designed for businesses for now, but it&apos;s definitely a glimpse into the future of video chat.</p><p>At last year&apos;s I/O conference, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-project-starline-new-prototype-2023">revealed a prototype that&apos;s way smaller and sleeker</a> compared to the original bulky booth-like design. Instead of a booth, the new version is more like a digital whiteboard. It&apos;s got just a few cameras around the screen, but it used AI to work out the depth, giving it that 3D feel.</p>

<p>After years of tinkering, Google is finally bringing Project Starline out of the lab and into the real world.</p><p>Google mentioned that after clocking in thousands of hours of testing across Google offices and with business partners, it discovered that meetings in Starline feel more like being physically together than just your usual video calls.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company points out that this results in people paying better attention, remembering things easier, and feeling more like they&apos;re in the same room, not miles apart. In Starline, folks behave as if they&apos;re right there in the same room, not separated by thousands of miles, according to the company.</p><p>No pricing details are available yet, but it&apos;s likely that bigger companies with the cash and room to spare will be the first to dive in. Google has promised to make Project Starline cheaper and easier to get hold of eventually, but for now, it&apos;s not really meant for personal use.</p>
