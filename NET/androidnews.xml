<ul><li>Samsung announced on Wednesday (June 20) that it will be expanding its News App<br>
to include more comprehensive political and sports news coverage.</li><li>The app will showcase a dedicated tab for the upcoming 2024 presidential U.S. elections and the popular soccer league La Liga.</li><li>The update has rolled out to all Galaxy users in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s almost election season in the U.S., and Samsung doesn&apos;t want you playing catch up, hunting down news channels to keep up with the happenings of the day. This is why it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-news-product-updates-for-galaxy-owners-news-sports-more/">announced</a> on Wednesday (June 20) that it will be expanding its News App to include in-depth coverage of major upcoming events, including the 2024 United States Presidential Election, with a new update to the app. </p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-news-launch">launched</a> the Samsung News app a year ago—a revamped version of the existing Samsung Free application that helps Galaxy users explore news globally from trusted sources like Bloomberg Media, CNN, and Fox News. The app offers daily news briefings, a customized news feed based on the user&apos;s interests, and podcasts from news/entertainment channels within the app.</p><p>In the past year, "Samsung News has become a daily touchpoint for millions of people looking for easy-to-access updates from their favorite local and national news outlets," said Avner Ronen, VP of product development for Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nM7LyJKbnL2YmWvD7EnrKC" name="samsung-news-galaxy-mobile.jpg" alt="Samsung News App Update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nM7LyJKbnL2YmWvD7EnrKC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this new update, targeted towards people in the U.S., Samsung News will sport a dedicated tab within the app that will be a "comprehensive hub for the Presidential election coverage." This tab will host an updated calendar of key dates such as debates, party conventions, other upcoming events, candidate profiles, and updated presidential polls. </p><p>Additionally, Samsung is taking it further and collaborating with La Liga before its 94th season kick-off. As their new content partner, Samsung aims to showcase up-to-date information on everything soccer and trending news stories of the user&apos;s favorite teams and players. </p><p>"This partnership will serve as a new tool to not only promote the league and its clubs but also expand our reach in North America through a timely and effective channel,” said Alan Nissim, head of business operations for La Liga North America.</p><p>Samsung has partnered with other news sources, such as Yahoo Sports, ESPN, CNBC, and Good Morning America.</p><p>It looks like Samsung is trying to keep up with users as more people continue to reach for their mobile devices to access the news of the day, more so on the go. The news update is now available to all Galaxy users in the U.S. However, it remains unclear when the said update will roll out to other markets across the board. </p><p>Android Central contacted Samsung for more details, but it did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed several patches for June regarding its Play Systems for Android users, which brings security and privacy fixes alongside Play Protect improvements.</li><li>Google also rolled out "auto-lock" for lost or stolen devices alongside the ability for users to use a USB cable and WiFi for data restoration and backup.</li><li>Pixel phones received a June security patch earlier this month, which packed loads of fixes for several user-reported issues.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out another wave of Play Service updates for Android users that encompass a range of issues.</p><p>The company detailed its recent set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">patch notes</a> on its Systems page (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/20/june-2024-google-system-updates/#more-623645">9to5Google</a>). Google is starting to roll out version <strong>24.24 </strong>of its Play Services, which brings a new set of goodies for app developers. The notes state that there are several "new features" rolling in for Google and other developers creating apps that could piggyback off Wallet.</p><p>Those users should find new support for Digital Wallets & Payment-related processes within their apps. Google is also patching a few security and privacy issues for users on PC, mobile, and smart TVs.</p><p>Version 41.5 of the Google Play Store aims to provide "improved protection" from Play Protect when users install apps.</p><p>Several more system updates for June are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>With this new security feature, you’ll be able to set a lost or stolen device to auto-lock once it loses connectivity (Phones).</li><li>With this new feature, you can now use your USB and Wi-Fi at the same time to backup and restore your device during setup (Phones).</li><li>New developer features for Google and third party app developers to support Maps related processes in their apps (App Developers).</li><li>New developer features for Google and third party app developers to support Account Management related processes in their apps (App Developers).</li></ul>

<p>For "Device Health," Google rolled out a patch that included optimizations for Android&apos;s "Adaptive Battery" feature. Additional bug fixes for device disconnections have arrived in June, as well.</p><p>Google&apos;s listed addition of "auto-lock" for a lost or stolen device seemingly refers to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Offline Device Lock</a>." The company detailed the coming feature during I/O 2024, stating it would help users with devices on its Find My Device network. If a device is taken offline for too long, it will automatically lock itself to protect your data.</p><p>Additionally, if a malicious person fails too many sign-in attempts, your phone will lock down.</p><p>What&apos;s unclear is if Google&apos;s listed USB and WiFi usage for data transfers is referring to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-preps-data-restore-tool-transfer-upgrades">what was discovered in May</a>. The company&apos;s Data Restore Tool app featured a few glimpses into this new method to speed up data transfers. Essentially, users should be able to restore the data of an old phone without needing to factory reset.</p><p>Google&apos;s June updates for its services should automatically download and install as we finish the week. In other news, Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-security-patch">grabbed a June patch</a> with loads of fixes for stability, battery, charging, and camera problems.</p>

<ul><li>A new OnePlus Watch has appeared for its TENAA certification with specifications and a rendering in tow.</li><li>The device will reportedly arrive with LTE support, a 500mAh battery, and 10W charging capabilities.</li><li>Its render showcases a circular watch face and dials with two physical (pressable) buttons on the right side.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It appears that OnePlus is preparing a new smartwatch to hit the market, though it&apos;s unclear where it will fall in the series.</p><p>The folks over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/wearables/wearables-news/alleged-oneplus-watch-3-tenaa-certification/">MySmartPrice </a>discovered the upcoming OnePlus Watch receiving its TENAA certification (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-2-lte-variant-leak-3453013/">Android Authority</a>). A few key specs accompanied the database listing, such as its LTE support for e-SIM devices. Further details state that the watch will support e-SIMs provided by China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile.</p><p>Other specifications suggest the device will feature a 500mAh battery, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>. The publication reiterated that a previous certification discovery shows the device will likely offer 10W wired charging capabilities.</p><p>However, it seems OnePlus isn&apos;t attaching a power adapter with this launch, meaning consumers may need to use one on hand or purchase one separately.</p><p>The upcoming OnePlus device, rumored to be the Watch 3, had a few of its renders uploaded with its certification. The device appears similar to the Watch 2, but there seem to be two circular (pushable) physical buttons on the right side. The circular watch face is here to stay alongside evidence of a dial.</p><p>The certification lists the device as model number <strong>OPWW234</strong>, furthering speculation that it&apos;s the OnePlus Watch 3. With its listed specifications and the fact that the Watch 2 launched in February, this device feels more like a Watch 2 variant than anything else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="xMXRX8Yh2wKr2dZfJQH3gA" name="oneplus-watch-lte-variant-2024.jpg" alt="A rendering of the new OnePlus Watch appearing for its certification." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xMXRX8Yh2wKr2dZfJQH3gA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MySmartPrice)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There aren&apos;t many more details to unpack about this upcoming OnePlus Watch aside from its battery, connectivity, and design elements. The watch has continued to make its certification rounds in multiple databases, which could indicate an impending launch.</p><p>For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-mwc-2024-launch">OnePlus Watch 2 launched</a> during MWC 2024 in February with a 100-hour battery and Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon W5 performance chipset. The device arrived with 7.5W VOOC fast charging, able to reach a full charge in an hour. OnePlus hit the U.S. market with a $299 price tag, though it&apos;s hard to say where this new device could land.</p><p>One thing to note is that the Watch 2 debuted <em>without </em>LTE support — this new device making its certification rounds solves that. So, it seems more likely that this upcoming watch is more of an LTE variant for those who fancy that more.</p>

<ul><li>1Password detailed its rollout of "Recovery Codes" that should help users regain access to their accounts if they lose their credentials or Security Key.</li><li>The company encourages users to create a code as soon as possible, as the option to do so will be unavailable if they're locked out.</li><li>1Password is also reportedly preparing to bring a QR code sign-in method for existing users and new devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (June 20), 1Password announced a new, user-friendly method folks can utilize to ensure they never lose their data.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.1password.com/introducing-1password-recovery-codes/">blog post</a>, 1Password is starting to roll out "Recovery Codes" to all users. The company states that it wants users to have "peace of mind and control that comes with knowing you’ll never be locked out of your account." 1Password states its Recovery Codes are "unique and secure" as they&apos;re generated by the main website or its app as a backup.</p><p>Users can grab a recovery code if they&apos;ve forgotten their passwords, if two-factor authentication isn&apos;t an option, or if their Security Key is lost.</p><p>The post encourages users to create a recovery code as soon as possible, as that option will disappear if they can&apos;t access their account. Users can begin doing so with the following steps:</p>
<ul><li>Open and unlock the 1Password app.</li><li>Select your account or collection at the top of the sidebar and choose <strong>Manage Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Choose your account and then select <strong>Sign-in & Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Set up recovery code</strong> and follow the onscreen instructions.</li></ul>

<p>After regaining account access through a code, 1Password states users can reset their credentials (password). Recovery codes can be generated through the app or the website on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux devices.</p><p>The codes are lengthy, and 1Password suggests saving them somewhere you won&apos;t lose or forget.</p><p>This new account-saving method should help users breathe a sigh of relief as there was previously no way of saving their data, even with support. The company states its new codes should help Family Organizers and customers on its Individual plan breathe easy.</p><p>That&apos;s not all as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/20/1password-recovery-code-sign-in-beta/">9to5Google</a> states 1Password is preparing to incorporate a new, easier sign-in method for new devices "by the end" of the summer. According to the post, the company is preparing to bring a QR code sign-in for new devices that will be using your account.</p><p>The feature will reportedly arrive in beta first before hitting all users later in the year.</p><p>Recovery codes are starting to arrive a few months after 1Password brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/1password-existing-user-passkey-support-android-rollout">passkey support</a> to all users rocking Android 14.</p>

<hr>
<p>A discovery made on a South Korean website seemingly spoils the new Galaxy Buds 3 charging case.</p><p>The early site listing was found by X user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TEQHNIKACROSS/status/1803771740902035561">TEQNIKA</a>, which shows a case change made to accommodate Samsung&apos;s new design (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/20/galaxy-buds-3-leak-shows-off-a-case-nearly-identical-to-airpods-pro/">9to5Google</a>). The user states that the Korean website Coupang is the source behind the new clear-top Galaxy Buds 3 case. The initial rendering suggests consumers can see their buds alongside a green dot on the outside, likely indicative of the case&apos;s reserves.</p><p>The second photo from the retail listing gives us a better look at how the buds will sit in the case. Considering the supposed new stem-like design, the buds stand upright in the case within black holders. There are lights on each holder, most likely another indicator of its charging process when the top is opened.</p><p>It also looks like users can clip their charging case onto their bags. On a related note, 9to5 mentions that this revamped design looks similar to Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/airpods-pro-review">AirPods Pro</a> case — which is true, minus the clear dome.</p><p>Lastly, that early retail listing gives us our clearest look at the new Buds 3. Its smooth, silvery design is evident alongside its new stem, forgoing the old bulbous look.</p>

<p>A redesigned Galaxy Bud has been theorized for a while now, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-apple-like-redesign-leak">pixelated render leak</a> earlier this month expanded on it. Again, it showed Samsung&apos;s apparent interest in moving toward an Apple-like design, which might not be bad as it could introduce a stem over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">stabilization wingtip</a>.</p><p>What&apos;s more, a recent leak shows that this new supposed stem design might come packed with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-stem-design-to-feature-pinch-controls">pinch-based touch controls</a>. The discovery was made through the code of the Samsung Members app, revealing that the Galaxy Buds 3 stem could feature pinch <em>and </em>hold-based touch controls.</p><p>Speculation says double pinching could skip songs or decline phone calls. Single pinches might act as the "play" button for songs and to answer incoming calls.</p><p>We&apos;re not far from knowing how true this early listing is as a summer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-gets-launch-date">Unpacked countdown</a> recently surfaced.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Many YouTube Premium users are experiencing random cancellations, likely due to using VPNs for cheaper rates.</li><li>A Reddit user confirmed with customer support that changes in their location led to their subscription being canceled.</li><li>Customer service suggests affected users re-subscribe using their local address and payment method.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Several YouTube Premium users see their memberships randomly canceled, likely because they used a VPN to get a cheaper rate.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1di5mz5/comment/l91rrqr/" target="_blank">thread on Reddit</a> highlighted a wave of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> subscriptions being axed. It appears that these cancellations are linked to users resorting to VPN services in order to score cheaper rates by taking advantage of regional pricing loopholes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-vpn-cheap-subscription-clampdown-3452674/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>YouTube offers a tiered pricing system for its Premium service to account for differences in global purchasing power. However, some users have been gaming it by using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">VPN services</a> to fake their location and get cheaper rates. This trick undermines the fairness of YouTube&apos;s regional pricing model.</p><p>To illustrate the price disparity, a Premium subscription in Ukraine costs £2.30 per month, whereas it normally costs $13.99 per month in the US.</p><p>By exploiting regional pricing differences with VPNs, some users managed to get YouTube Premium for a fraction of the cost in their home market. Although the subscription worked fine after the initial VPN trick, Google now seems to be cracking down on this loophole in its pricing system.</p><p>In one case, a Reddit user contacted YouTube customer support about their canceled subscription. The response suggested that the user&apos;s location had supposedly changed from the one they used at signup.</p><p>Customer service also advised affected users to re-subscribe using their local address and a payment method from their region. This apparent crackdown seems to be aimed at enforcing regional pricing for YouTube Premium.</p><p>We&apos;ve reached out to Google to confirm if the company is targeting VPN-sourced YouTube Premium subscriptions and will update this article once we hear back.</p><p>Notably, reports of subscription cancellations aren&apos;t limited to Ukrainian users who use VPNs. Users from multiple countries who used VPNs to score cheaper YouTube Premium subscriptions have reported cancellations as well.</p><p>To regain access to YouTube Premium, affected users need to re-subscribe using their verified location details.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>A YouTube spokesperson told Android Central in an emailed statement that the service has implemented stricter measures to ensure regional pricing compliance for YouTube Premium subscriptions.</p><p>"To provide the most accurate plans and offers available, we have systems in place to determine the country of our users," the spokesperson said. "In instances where the signup country does not match where the user is accessing YouTube, we&apos;re asking members to update their billing information to their current country of residence."</p>

Well over 200 games are currently available, with several impressive releases like Horizon Call of the Mountain, Gran Turismo 7, and the duo of Resident Evil Village <em>and</em> Resident Evil 4 Remake. However, the headset now has an insurmountable problem: Sony no longer cares about it.</p><p>Sources close to Android Central have revealed that Sony is making deep cuts to funding for VR games. While I&apos;ll paraphrase for anonymity, my source was told that there will be very few opportunities for VR game development at Sony going forward.</p><p>To back that up, another source informed me that only two PSVR 2 games are in development at Sony. Given the state of the games industry with constant layoffs and studio closings, I don&apos;t exactly feel confident that even these games will ever see the light of day if Sony continues on its current trajectory.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Sony about its PlayStation VR2 development plans but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>I should have seen the writing on the wall when Sony&apos;s Insomniac Games studio got hacked in December 2023, revealing the fact that the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/18lvqor/insomniac_leaks_compilation/">wasn&apos;t working on</a> a single VR game for Sony&apos;s flagship VR system, the PlayStation VR2.</p><p>That&apos;s important because Insomniac Games, maker of the Spider-Man series, Ratchet & Clank, Spyro the Dragon, and several other well-known and successful properties, made four games for Meta&apos;s (then Facebook) Oculus Rift platform. Three of those games were very well received, and many consider Stormland to still be among the very best open-world VR games playable on PC today. Yet, Sony has them working on exactly zero PSVR 2 games.</p><p>Last year, Sony released just three PSVR 2 games and has yet to officially announce even one first-party game coming out for the system in 2024, let alone in 2025. Of those three games, Firewall Ultra developer First Contact Entertainment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/vr-developer-first-contact-closes-down">has since shut down</a>. To add insult to injury, Sony then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-reevaluating-playstation-studios-and-cutting-900-jobs">closed down London Studio</a> in February—a team responsible for another of the PSVR&apos;s highest-rated games, Blood & Truth, as well as the PlayStation VR Worlds demo disc.</p><p>Even Firesprite, the developer behind the excellent Horizon Call of the Mountain, has seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firesprite-lays-off-horizon-director-alex-barnes-in-playstation-layoffs">substantial budget and personnel cuts</a> and even game cancellations. That doesn&apos;t leave much for Sony&apos;s first-party development studios.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sources close to Android Central have revealed that the company only has two first-party PSVR 2 titles in development.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Fast forward to the May 2024&apos;s State of Play, Sony&apos;s Summer gaming showcase that revealed all sorts of fun games including a brand new Astro Bot title that fans have been salivating for. The original Astro Bot Rescue Mission is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/astro-bot-rescue-mission/">highest-rated PSVR game</a> of all time and was recommended as a must-play for any new PSVR owner for as long as that system was supported.</p><p>The trouble is that the sequel doesn&apos;t have any kind of VR support at all. Games like Astro Bot take years to make, which tells me that Sony gave up on the PSVR 2 a long time ago. These decisions aren&apos;t made arbitrarily, and while it&apos;s perfectly within a studio&apos;s right to decide its own path forward, the evidence makes it clear that Sony no longer has an interest in supporting its VR headset.</p>

<p>When Astro made an appearance on May&apos;s State of Play showcase, I immediately got excited. Astro is such a lovable character, and the appearance of the PS5 controller on-screen—with Astro riding it, no less—certainly looked like PSVR 2 support was in the game. That is until I noticed there was no PSVR 2 logo at the end of the trailer. Only the PS5 logo.</p><p>Unfortunately for me and every other PSVR Astro fan, a recently published interview <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/astro-bot-no-playstation-vr2-support/">on Digital Trends</a> confirmed that the company isn&apos;t planning a VR mode for Astro Bot at all. There is no DLC, no update later down the road, and no VR. What a stab in the back for what made Astro popular in the first place.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The sequel to the best PSVR game doesn't even have PSVR 2 support. Talk about a stab in the back.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When Giovanni Colantonio asked why, he was given this incredibly disingenuous response by Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet:</p><p>"We&apos;re focusing 100% on PS5. Rescue Mission was great fun to make. Every medium has its strong points. In the case of a third-person game, whether you work on TV or VR is radically different. This idea that we could add a VR mode is not applicable to this kind of game. It&apos;s applicable to some first-person games like racing, but not for this kind of game. So our choice was to go 100% for TV to really have as many people as possible playing this game."</p>

<p>Yet, studios like Flat2VR have proven that modifying games made for TVs isn&apos;t all that difficult. Popular PC modder Praydog released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/praydogs-uevr-mod/">a new app in January</a> of this year that turns any modern Unreal Engine game into a VR game with just a few clicks.</p><p>To prove its worth, VR gaming streamer Paradise Decay used Praydog&apos;s app to turn Sony&apos;s Sackboy PS5 platformer into a lovely VR title, viewable in the YouTube video below.</p><p>Some of this can be chalked up to Sony&apos;s overall strategy shifting. As of June 2024, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideaki-nishino-and-hermen-hulst-playstation-ceos">now has two CEOs</a> as it split the PlayStation business into separate hardware and software divisions, and Sony&apos;s software CEO seems to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795966798942158935">very narrow-minded vision</a> of the future of PlayStation as a brand.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-to-hybrid-aaa-2">What happened to hybrid AAA?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PjCrhnfZWnk4MPKLJrP8K8" name="resident-evil-4-vr-remake-psvr-2.jpg" alt="A screenshot from Resident Evil 4 Remake VR on PSVR 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjCrhnfZWnk4MPKLJrP8K8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Capcom)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In January 2022, Sony executives were said to be focusing on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sonys-psvr-2-strategy-puts-it-odds-apple-and-meta-and-thats-good-thing">hybrid AAA strategy</a>, meaning AAA games like Horizon, Uncharted, The Last of Us, Spider-Man, and potentially other Sony games could see a VR mode launch alongside the regular version of the game. In the case of Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 4 Remake, the VR version came just a few months after the TV version launched.</p><p>But other than Gran Turismo 7, we haven&apos;t seen or heard of another hybrid AAA game from any of Sony&apos;s studios. If any game should have received the treatment, it was Astro Bot, which we obviously already covered.</p><p>So if Sony has all but abandoned dedicated VR games and doesn&apos;t seem convinced that hybrid AAA games will work, what&apos;s left? Because of some absurdly stupid software limitations, there&apos;s no backward compatibility support for original PSVR games, and Sony has already told fans to forget about ever getting it. Scratch another thing off the list.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPcCWR3DTIw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>So, how about PC VR support? Earlier this year, Sony announced that it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/psvr-2-pcvr-firmware-update">make the PSVR 2 work on PCs</a>. Just after it virtually wrung its proverbial hands of the PSVR 2 in the State of Play showcase, Sony finally detailed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">PSVR 2 PC adapter</a>, which would cost $60 and be available on August 7.</p><p>The problem? All of the tentpole features of the headset <em>won&apos;t work</em> on PCs. That includes HDR, headset vibration, eye tracking (and eye-tracked foveated rendering), adaptive triggers, and controller haptic feedback. All that, and you&apos;re still tethered to your PC with a USB cable and a dongle box that looks like it came packed with the original Oculus Rift from 2016.</p><p>At this point, we need to forget that PSVR 2 even exists. Sony already has. You&apos;re far better off getting yourself a Meta Quest 3 this year, which has exclusives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-story-interview">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/summer-games-fest-has-already-begun-for-the-meta-quest-3">Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded</a>, and Just Dance VR, to name a few.</p><p>Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> list is far longer than the PSVR 2 list and includes many AAA games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/behemoth-hands-on">Skydance&apos;s Behemoth</a>, Alien: Rogue Incursion, Metro Awakening, Metal: Hellsinger VR, and maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, even Grand Theft Auto VR.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors are swirling about Samsung&apos;s potential delay of One UI 7 (Android 15) as it works to roll out One UI 6.1.1 and its Galaxy upgrades.</p><p>Speculation stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1803244755448664282">Ice Universe</a> on X, who states, "One UI 7 will not arrive very early" due to One UI 6.1.1 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-could-delay-one-ui-7-favor-one-ui-611-galaxy-phone/">Android Police</a>). The OS update allegedly contains "many new" AI features that are said to be a noticeable upgrade over what Galaxy phones currently have.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster claims that Samsung will start rolling this update out to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> in August. AI updates for the soon-to-be-released Galaxy Fold 6 will reportedly join that OS update with camera improvements.</p><p>One UI 6.1.1 is also rumored to feature a few goodies for Galaxy devices rocking an S Pen buddy. The tipster&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1803282079305830649">additional leak</a> states the update will include a "graffiti generation" image function. Aside from their initial reaction, the tipster didn&apos;t go into detail about what the graffiti function does specifically.</p><p>Perhaps it quickly turns handwritten text into stylized spray paint like you&apos;d see scrawled across concrete walls. But we&apos;ll wait and see.</p><p>Samsung has brought a range of its Galaxy AI features to its past-gen devices, and it seems that this S Pen is no different. A follow-up post claims that the company could extend this graffiti feature to "many models" aside from the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 7 will not arrive very early, because there are special circumstances this year.Samsung will first push One UI 6.1.1 to S24 series.

<p>It was confirmed by a Samsung community manager that the Galaxy S24 will pick up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24s-slow-mo-hdr-boost-confirmed">some HDR updates</a> during its One UI 6.1.1 update. The manager stated that HDR 10 Plus is on its way for the Instant Slow-Mo feature. Users leverage the cool slowing effect during higher-quality video settings without sacrificing dynamic range.</p><p>Samsung plans to bring .mov file-type editing support to the Gallery app for supported devices alongside sharing options. The post stated users can quickly tap the new "Share" icon on any video with a Slow-Mo effect to send it out via text or in apps. This aims to remove the necessity of exporting the video first.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">report claimed</a> that Samsung had already started initially testing One UI 7 (Android 15) early in May. Evidence was attributed to a discovery made on Samsung&apos;s European servers. This makes sense as the company usually starts its beta program for the next major OS in the summer.</p><p>More importantly, Google just achieved "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-3-platform-stability-rollout">Platform Stability</a>" for Android 15.

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re around seven months away from a potential Galaxy S25 drop, but that&apos;s not stopping the flow of rumors about sour camera upgrades.</p><p>According to the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s25/">GalaxyClub</a>, Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy S25 might miss out on camera upgrades again (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-camera-specs-leak-no-upgrade/">SamMobile</a>). Rumors suggest that the device will continue to provide a 50MP primary camera, just like the base S24 model from January.</p><p>The publication adds that the front-facing selfie camera might also remain unchanged at 12MP. What&apos;s interesting is that this selfie lens rumor reportedly refers to the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p><p>With the rumors teetering toward disappointment on the primary camera side, the report suggests that a few upgrades are in store for the ultrawide and telephoto lenses.</p><p>What those cameras could have in store is still unknown, so take that with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> features a 50MP primary camera, which has remained that way since the S22 days. However, the base model and its Plus sibling feature a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom capabilities.</p><p>With rumors those two auxiliary lenses <em>could be </em>in for improvements, it remains to be seen what attributes Samsung targets.</p><p>In other news, Samsung&apos;s upcoming Ultra model might grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fresh-leak-suggests-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-get-a-major-camera-boost">major camera boost</a>. Rumors at the end of May suggested the device could offer a 200MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide camera, a 50MP telephoto camera (3x optical zoom), and a 50MP super-telephoto camera (5x optical zoom).</p><p>If true, such improvements would see the S24 Ultra&apos;s 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephoto lenses outclassed by its upcoming successor.</p><p>The S25 Ultra&apos;s primary lens was also rumored to feature a 1-inch sensor, which could vastly improve its video capture capabilities, running it up to 8K resolution. Speculation states the device may feature Samsung&apos;s ISOCELL sensors to give it its own identity. The S25 and S25 Plus could grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors">Sony&apos;s imaging sensors</a> instead.</p>
