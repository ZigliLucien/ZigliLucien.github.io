<ul><li>OnePlus is beginning to roll out its Android 15-based OxygenOS 15 update to the original OnePlus Pad.</li><li>The update is now becoming available in India in batches, and will reach North America and Europe next week.</li><li>The move comes following the latest OnePlus Pad 2 getting the boost to OxygenOS 15 last month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus' last-generation tablet is starting to get the upgrade to Android 15. The OnePlus Pad is currently receiving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> update — based on Android 15 — in batches, starting in India. The company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1747432716451708936" target="_blank">post</a> on the OnePlus community forum that the update would become available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> users in North America and Europe next week. This gradual release timeline lines up with that of the OnePlus devices that have already gotten the boost to OxygenOS 15.</p><p>Compared to the brand's competitors, notably Samsung, OnePlus has brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its devices at a quick and consistent pace. The OnePlus 12 was first to receive OxygenOS 15, followed by the OnePlus Open and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, among other devices.</p><p>Notably, the company has been relatively quiet about its timeline for bringing Android 15 to the OnePlus Pad Go, its budget tablet. Based on its software support promise, the Pad Go is expected to receive OxygenOS 15, and the first-generation OnePlus Pad gaining support could be a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>In India, the build number for OxygenOS 15 on the OnePlus Pad is <strong>OPD2203_15.0.0.301(EX01)</strong>. OnePlus also shared rollback steps for reverting the OnePlus Pad to Android 14 with a Local OTA update in case users have trouble with Android 15. You can find the complete rollback instructions, plus updates on the North American and European rollout, on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1747432716451708936" target="_blank">community post</a>.</p><p>The OxygenOS 15 update for the OnePlus Pad includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-is-rolling-out-to-the-oneplus-pad-2-this-week-heres-whats-new">all the features and changes that the OnePlus Pad 2 received last month</a>, plus a few extras. Notably, the update adds support for the operating system's new multitasking gestures. Using these gestures, you can create a floating window by pulling down a notification banner, and similarly open an app in full-screen view by pulling down on a floating window. When you're finished, you can close a floating window by swiping up or hide it by swiping to the side.</p><p>Additionally, the update brings new AI features to the OnePlus Pad, including AI Notes and AI Retouch. OnePlus also touts the new animations and rendering effects bundled with this OxygenOS update, which is designed to create a "consistent scrolling experience" with "luminous rendering effects" also in tow.</p><p>Users in India can expect to see OxygenOS 15 become available on their OnePlus Pad starting now, with a wider global availability set to arrive next week.</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve been trying to compare Visible vs. T-Mobile but can&apos;t seem to decide which one to go with, we don&apos;t blame you. Choosing a wireless service provider isn&apos;t exactly a cakewalk these days, especially with the &apos;Big Three&apos; facing increasingly tough competition from some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier" target="_blank">best MVNO carriers</a> out there. No matter what your requirements or budget, there is no dearth of options in the market.</p><p>Of course, Visible and T-Mobile are two such options. While the former is a no-contract service provider offering just two prepaid plans, the latter is a mainstream carrier having no less than five full-featured plans. Visible&apos;s plans let you save quite a lot of money, but they stick to the basics. On the other hand, T-Mobile&apos;s plans pack a plethora of perks, but they also cost significantly more. There are several other factors worth taking into consideration as well, including everything from network coverage to device compatibility. So, the question is, which one is the better fit for your needs? Let&apos;s see how these two service providers stack up against each other and find out.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-visible-apos-s-plans-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Visible&apos;s plans</h2>
<p>Offering just two straightforward plans, Visible—which is owned and operated by Verizon—keeps things exceedingly simple. Its basic plan is just called Visible, and gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon&apos;s combined 5G/LTE network. You also get unlimited shared mobile hotspot usage at a speed of 5Mbps, as well talk & text to Mexico and Canada. Even with all that, the starter Visible plan costs a mere $25 per month, that too with all the taxes and fees included.</p>

<p>Then there&apos;s the higher plan, which is called Visible Plus. Along with all the benefits of the basic Visible plan, it unlocks access to Verizon&apos;s super-fast &apos;Ultra-Wideband&apos; 5G network, 50GB of premium data, unlimited shared mobile hotspot usage at an increased speed of 10Mbps, and 2GB of daily data in Mexico and Canada. Priced at $45 per month—again with all the taxes and fees included—Visible Plus further adds international calling to over 30 countries and unlimited texting to more than 200 countries around the world.</p><p>Although the monthly prices for both plans are quite affordable, you can save even more if you decide to pay for a full year of service in advance.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-t-mobile-apos-s-plans-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: T-Mobile&apos;s plans</h2>
<p>With T-Mobile, you get a total of five primary plans to pick from, with all of them offering a number of common benefits. These include unlimited talk, text, and data on the carrier&apos;s nationwide 5G/LTE network, unlimited shared mobile hotspot usage at 3G speeds, usage in Mexico and Canada, no annual service contract, and access to exclusive perks via T-Mobile Tuesdays.</p><p>Starting things off is the Essentials Saver plan, which costs $55 per month (before all the taxes and fees) for a single line and gives you 50GB of premium data on T-Mobile&apos;s high-speed &apos;Ultra-Capacity&apos; 5G network. You also get SD quality (480p) video streaming, unlimited data at up to 128Kbps in Mexico and Canada, and roaming usage in over 215 countries. The next plan is just called Essentials and costs $65 per month (excluding all the taxes and fees) for a single line. Interestingly, it offers exactly the same benefits as Essentials Saver, with the only difference being a higher number of lines eligible for multi-line discounts.</p>

<p>Then you have the Go5G plan, which offers 100GB of premium data, along with 15GB of dedicated high-speed mobile hotspot data. Priced at $80 per month (including all the taxes and fees) for one line, it also bundles up to HD quality (720p) video streaming, 10GB of high-speed data in Mexico and Canada, and six months of Apple TV+ subscription. The two highest plans—Go5G Plus and Go5G Next—unlock access to unlimited premium data, 50GB of dedicated high-speed mobile hotspot data, device upgrades, and up to UHD quality (4K) video streaming, while also throwing a number of additional goodies (e.g., up to 15GB of high-speed data in Mexico and Canada, in-flight connectivity, and T-Mobile Scam Shield Premium) into the mix. Go5G Plus and Go5G Next are priced $95 per month and $105 per month, respectively for one line – with both prices being inclusive of all the taxes and fees.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that all of the above-mentioned prices are before relevant autopay discounts, and you can save even more by signing up for multiple lines. T-Mobile also offers many of these plans at reduced prices to senior citizens (aged 55 years and above), military personnel and veterans, as well as first responders.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-network-coverage-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Network coverage</h2>
<p>As a Mobile Virtual Network Operator, Visible uses the network infrastructure of Verizon, its parent company. Verizon&apos;s primary low-band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-verizon-everything-you-need-know" target="_blank">5G network</a> offers fairly reliable nationwide coverage, with the carrier&apos;s legacy LTE network filling in the gaps wherever necessary. This means that you can get more-than-decent speeds just about everywhere, including in rural areas, even if you go for the base Visible plan.</p><p>However, it&apos;s the carrier&apos;s mid-band 5G network (including the C-band) that gives you blazing-fast speeds, in case you get the Visible Plus plan. This &apos;Ultra-Wideband&apos; 5G network isn&apos;t as widespread as the low-band network, but with continued deployment, it&apos;s bound to get better in future.</p>

<p>Talking about T-Mobile, the carrier&apos;s network infrastructure is arguably the best among the &apos;Big Three&apos; wireless service providers. You can expect excellent low-band 5G network coverage throughout the United States, regardless of the plan you go for. The mid-band &apos;Ultra-Capacity&apos; 5G network is also significantly better than the competition, although you might face some issues in rural areas.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-phone-compatibility-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Phone compatibility</h2>
<p>Although Visible sells a number of smartphones through its website, but the selection is somewhat limited. That being said, you have quite a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phones-visible" target="_blank">phones that&apos;ll work</a> with the MVNO just fine, since it ultimately utilizes Verizon&apos;s network.</p><p>While that&apos;s a good thing, Visible just can&apos;t match up to T-Mobile when it comes to device compatibility. As a matter of fact, nearly all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> will work sans any issues on T-Mobile&apos;s network. These include top-tier flagships such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, affordable options like the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, and everything in between.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GM9wfbo57GPzC8pvWWpMdH" name="OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G-back-01.jpg" alt="The shiny back of the OnePlus Nord N30 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GM9wfbo57GPzC8pvWWpMdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Both Visible and T-Mobile also let you bring your own unlocked phone, as long as it&apos;s compatible. To that end, you can simply enter your smartphone&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-imei-number-your-phone" target="_blank">IMEI number</a> on the online compatibility checker tool provided by each carrier and see if it&apos;ll work.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-which-should-you-go-for-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Which should you go for?</h2>
<p>Comparing Visible vs. T-Mobile and everything that they offer, it&apos;s evident that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to picking a wireless service provider. As an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-important-considerations-when-switching-mvno" target="_blank">MVNO</a>, Visible primarily focuses on maximizing your savings. Its two plans have all the essentials, along with some nice bonus features. Conversely, T-Mobile is a traditional carrier that simply gives you more. Its five main plans not only include all the basics but also come bundled with a diverse range of perks such as streaming services, in-flight connectivity, and much more. There&apos;s no wrong choice here, but we suggest going for the option that suits your individual use case the best.</p>

<p>If you want to get the most bang for your buck(s) and don&apos;t care about things like high-speed mobile hotspot functionality and regular phone upgrades, go ahead and get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review" target="_blank">Visible</a>. Its base plan offers exceptional value, and you can even get premium data and solid international usage benefits by paying only a little more. That being said, Visible works well only if you want to sign up for one line, as there are no multi-line discounts available with it.</p><p>However, if money is no object and you simply want the most out of your wireless service, we suggest going for T-Mobile. Yes, it doesn&apos;t come cheap, but even the base plans give you loads of high-speed data access, unlimited texting while roaming in hundreds of countries across the globe, and multi-line savings. If you sign up for one of the higher plans, you also get additional goodies like subscription services and up to UHD quality (4K) video streaming support.</p>

<p>The tradition of OnePlus' staggered flagship launches continues, and the OnePlus 13 is the worst-kept secret in tech. While the OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-global-launch-window-for-the-oneplus-13-and-its-soon">won't be officially unveiled in North America until January</a>, it's already available in China, and that means we know almost everything about it. So, how does it compare to Google's best Android flagship, the Pixel 9 Pro XL?</p><p>For now, a big unknown is the price of the OnePlus 13 in the US, which will likely be a significant factor in whether it's better or worse than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Historically, OnePlus phones have been cheaper than most other flagships, but that isn't guaranteed to continue. Both phones have a lot going for them — the Pixel 9 Pro XL has software and AI, meanwhile the OnePlus 13 has raw power and better hardware — and we're here to help you decide which is right for you.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-2">OnePlus 13 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TzbPJGZazXSa6yPQ2gCknn" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-pixel-8-pro-pixel-7-pro-back-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Pixel 8 Pro and 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TzbPJGZazXSa6yPQ2gCknn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> couldn't look more different, or at least, they're as different as two smartphones can be in 2024. While both are fairly rectangular with slight curves around the corners, they're differentiated by their camera housings. OnePlus went with its unmistakable circular camera housing, which holds the triple-camera system and flash. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a pill-shaped camera bar at the top of the phone's back. Additionally, the camera circle on the back of the OnePlus 13 isn't symmetrically positioned.</p><p>Both phones have similar screen sizes and dimensions, too. The OnePlus 13 sports a 6.82-inch display and measures 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5-8.9 mm. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch panel with dimensions of 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm. In other words, these two devices will feel pretty similar in the hand, although the OnePlus 13 is marginally larger.</p><p>Technically, the OnePlus 13 is more durable than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, as it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">rated IP69 for dust and water resistance</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is only rated for IP68, but you should know that the difference probably won't matter. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP68 still covers brief submersion in shallow water</a>, and IP69 only takes that a step further, offering protection against high-pressure and high-temperature water jet sprays. You probably won't ever need that level of water resistance on your phone, though it certainly can't hurt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.72%;"><img id="kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo" name="op-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1780" height="885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 can either be equipped with a glass back or an eco-leather silicone polymer back. It'll be available in black, blue, and white colorways. The Pixel 9 Pro XL comes in a few more colors and is only available with a glass back. You can choose from Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, and Obsidian colorways.</p><p>It's worth noting that, at 210 or 213 grams, the OnePlus 13 will feel noticeably heavier than the 199-gram Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 13 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW" name="OnePlus-13" alt="OnePlus 13 back camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A theme of this comparison will be that the OnePlus 13 will often win on the spec sheet, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL may still be the winner in daily use. For example, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which uses the same custom Oryon cores that Qualcomm developed for its laptop-class chips. By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip in the Pixel 9 Pro XL is significantly less powerful, even if it may be better optimized for Google's hardware.</p><p>It's a similar story for the display. The sizes are similar, at 6.82 inches for OnePlus 13 and 6.8 inches for the Pixel 9 Pro XL. They're also both OLED screens capable of reaching 120Hz refresh rates. However, the OnePlus 13 will be brighter thanks to its 4,500-nit peak brightness rating. The Pixel 9 Pro XL tops out at 3,000 nits. If past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> are any indication of the OnePlus 13's brightness, the difference between these two displays should be noticeable in daily use.</p><p>Both phones use hole-punch, front-facing cameras. The OnePlus 13 has a 32MP, f/2.4 lens, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 42MP, f/2.2 lens. We'll have to test these phones side-by-side for ourselves before we tell you which camera is best.</p>

<p>For the rear cameras, there are a lot of similarities. Both phones use a 50MP main camera with similar apertures. Additionally, the OnePlus 13's 50MP ultra wide camera and the Pixel 9 Pro XL's 48MP wide camera match up well. However, there's a big difference in zoom performance. The Pixel 9 Pro XL provides 5x optical zoom, while the OnePlus 13 only provides 3x optical zoom.</p><p>OnePlus continues its battery and charging dominance with the OnePlus 13. It brings a massive 6,000mAh battery with 100W wired charging. The Pixel 9 Pro XL's 5,060mAh battery and 37W wired charging speeds are fine, but don't compare to the OnePlus 13's offerings.</p><p>In terms of connectivity, the OnePlus 13 and Pixel 9 Pro XL both support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, 5G, and NFC.

<p>The OnePlus 13 will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15, which is based on Android 15</a>. It'll get security updates for five years, but OxygenOS upgrades for only four years. That's a low number, considering Google offers seven years of full OS upgrades on the Pixel 9 Pro XL. However, you may not want to make a purchasing decision based on software support alone because we don't know what Android will look like on the Pixel 9 Pro XL in seven years. It's still a gamble.</p><p>One area where the Pixel 9 Pro XL decisively beats the OnePlus 13 is in AI. From features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> to apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel Screenshots</a> to features like Add Me — the Pixel has it all. While OnePlus is starting to catch up, if you want AI, you should still buy a Pixel.</p>

<p>For now, the "sure thing" recommendation is the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's a rock-solid phone at a decent price with tons of software support. We still haven't tried the OnePlus 13 for ourselves and are missing key details about the handset, namely its US pricing. As such, it's impossible to recommend the OnePlus 13 today.</p><p>However, I'm optimistic that the OnePlus 13 — with a more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> and better hardware in a few key areas — could dethrone the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it launches in January. If you can wait a month to see what the OnePlus 13 will hold, you should.</p>

<ul><li>Following the shuttering of Google Podcasts, YouTube Music is now Google's podcast delivery app, but it has lacked a few major features typically offered by podcast apps.</li><li>Google is now adding the ability to share audio links from the YouTube Music app that start at a specific timestamp.</li><li>The feature mimics the same functionality that was added to the main YouTube app this year, and is available on both iOS and Android.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google made a major shift in its podcasts delivery strategy this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-shuts-down">shuttering Google Podcasts</a> in favor of YouTube Music. That decision was met with ire from fans, because YouTube Music lacks a few features that are staples on other podcast apps. However, the company has been making slow-and-steady progress with YouTube Music, and that's continuing — the app is gaining a long-overdue feature that'll be helpful for podcast listeners.</p><p>Just like the main YouTube app, you can now create a shareable link in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music app</a> for a song, podcast, or other recording that starts at a specific timestamp. The new addition, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/08/youtube-music-timestamp-sharing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, appears to be the result of a server-side change. Android Central confirmed the feature's availability on a variety of Android 14 and Android 15 devices, which didn't require an update.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:324px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.38%;"><img id="DErMTEPWYP5mXbV5sP2uwJ" name="YouTube-Music-Timestamps" alt="The timestamp sharing option in YouTube Music." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DErMTEPWYP5mXbV5sP2uwJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="324" height="727" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After tapping the share button on the now playing screen, there is now a toggle at the top right corner of the share card that reads <strong>Start at [timestamp]</strong>. This will create a link for sharing that starts at your current timestamp. It's helpful for when you only want to share a specific part of a long podcast. The app will add <strong>t=XX</strong> to the link, where XX is the current position in the timeline in seconds. Then, you can share it like any other YouTube Music link.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:324px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.38%;"><img id="pdnUxJKvw4NazGEwUZDMwJ" name="YouTube-Music-Timestamps-2" alt="The timestamp sharing option in YouTube Music." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdnUxJKvw4NazGEwUZDMwJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="324" height="727" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the feature may be more useful for long-form audio content, like podcasts, it'll work for any type of content in YouTube Music, including songs. Now, whether you're using the YouTube or YouTube Music app, you'll be able to create a shareable link that starts at a specific timestamp.</p><p>The new option appears to be widely available on both iOS and Android; however, at least one of Android Central's devices had not yet received the server-side change. It's also available on the YouTube Music web client, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-on-the-web-gets-a-redesign-but-its-not-winning-everyone-over">redesigned earlier this year</a>.</p>

<ul><li>HP announced a series of Fortis G1i and Fortis G1m Chromebooks and Notebook PCs geared for students.</li><li>The Fortis G1i Chromebook features a 14-inch variant with strong MIL-STD tested durability, ChromeOS updates through 2035, and swift charging.</li><li>The Fortis G1i laptops will hit the market in January 2025 while the Fortis G1m devices become "later" in December for $249 on hp.com.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>HP is expanding its world of available Chromebooks by helping students who're constantly on the go during the school year.</p><p>According to a press release, HP states its latest wave of Chromebooks might help K-12 leaders who've highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/when-the-money-runs-out-k-12-schools-brace-for-stimulus-free-budgets">growing concerns</a> for student's access to technology and its dwindling budget in schools. Kicking off HP's December reveal are the Fortis G1i Chrombook and Notebook PCs.</p><p>The top-tier laptop in the Fortis G1i lineup is the 14-inch FHD Chromebook which doubles as a touchscreen for easier use. HP touts the device as a "ruggedized" partner that students can keep with them in the classroom or take on the go.</p><p>To strengthen that, the laptop "adheres" to the MIL-STD in durability and has received an IP51 rating to help its durability. HP intends for these additions to help students (and parents) avoid any costly accidents.</p><p>Software-wise, HP says it has implemented a "low-maintenance" version of ChromeOS on the Fortis G1i 14-inch laptop. The software should be easy to manage for students and the company states it will update automatically. This laptop is guaranteed ChromeOS updates through June 2035.</p><p>This Chromebook features several connectivity options through Wi-Fi 6E wireless LAN and Bluetooth support.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:710px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.51%;"><img id="Y3HB4LmZWVn7YfhQEnLW35" name="hp-fortis-g1i-14-inch-chromebook" alt="The HP Fortis G1i Chromebook, 14-inch display version." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y3HB4LmZWVn7YfhQEnLW35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="710" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HP)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Security and privacy is another area HP has honed in on with the Fortis G1i Chromebook. The post states students will have access to its HP Privacy Camera: a feature that includes a shutter to cover the camera lens when not in use. The company states this should give consumers "peace of mind" against "malicious surveillance."</p><p>The laptop is also highlighted as a device that offers "supercharged performance." The Chromebook can charge up to 90% in ~90 minutes. Additionally, consumers will be able to grab the device with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage.</p><p>The company says this device will be available on hp.com in January 2025 with its pricing listed shortly before that. More importantly, the 14-inch display variant will be joined by an 11-inch option. HP detailed the 11-inch Flip Chromebook, which lets students rotate its display 360 degrees in its hinge for comfortable use. Moreover, the computer offers an optional HP stylus for better writing and interactions.</p>

<p>The 11-inch Flip Notebook PC is another spin on HP's rotatable laptop. According to its post, the laptop can rotate 360 degrees much like the Chromebook variant for quick note-taking. However, HP states consumers can grab its Pro Slim Rechargeable Pen to help with the laptop's touchscreen. The stylus can be slotted into the computer's "water-resistant garage" on the keyboard for safekeeping.</p><p>Two cameras are what students will find when opening this laptop for the first time. These lenses enter at 5MP, which is useful for recording school projects.</p><p>For apps, HP detailed the addition of several Android apps. The company adds that these apps are tailored toward being educational, which are reportedly "easy to install and manage."</p><p>Other specifications see the Flip Notebook PC offering up to 16GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage.</p><p>Like the previously mentioned Chromebooks, the 11-inch Flip Notebook PC will be available for purchase in January 2025 via hp.com. The pricing for it will be posted shortly before that per HP's official announcement.</p>

<p>HP's announcement includes the Fortis G1m series Chromebooks. These devices offer a standard laptop experience, as well as a G1m Flip choice. Starting with the former, HP states the Fortis G1m 11-inch Chromebook is a lightweight computer that offers "key features" like "uninterrupted" performance.</p><p>Managing multiple apps and research papers will become a little easier as the laptop boasts the MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor. Joining that processor is the Chromebook's support for up to 64GB of eMMC storage and up to 8GB of RAM.</p><p>HP designed the G1m Chromebook with a sleek form, making it worth stuffing into your backpack with your books and journals. Similar to the Fortis G1i lineup, the M-version delivers a streamlined ChromeOS experience that takes its power efficiency focus to another level. HP states the software will have a minimal boot up time for students alongside fast web browsing.</p><p>The Fortis G1m Flip Chromebook is said to feature a 360 degree rotation on its hinge, a dual camera system, and an HP USI Garaged Pen.</p><p>These two Fortis G1m devices will be available "later" in December on hp.com for $249.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung was spotted pushing its monthly security patch to several of its current-gen devices.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-plus-ultra-fe-december-2024-security-update/">SamMobile</a>, the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a> are beginning to receive the December 2024 security patch. What's important about this is that the devices have been spotted downloading the update in South Korea with version number <strong>S92xNKSS5AXKA</strong>. It seems like we can expect the U.S. version and other regions to see the update as the week progresses.</p><p>The changelog is extremely light, with the Korean OEM only highlighting the existence of "security fixes/enhancements" with the December patch.</p><p>The publication highlighted a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/deze-samsung-telefoons-krijgen-de-laatste-update-van-2024-als-eerste/">GalaxyClub</a> (Dutch), which states the update features "eight" fixes for aspects like the One UI interface, Settings app, DeX, and more.</p><p>Samsung's December <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">patch changelog</a> detailed six "Critical" level fixes alongside 28 "High" level fixes. The company is correcting issues for ThemeCenter, as well as an opening that could've allowed an attacker to "improperly" alter your Galaxy phone's settings. A fix for the Cryptographic Signature in SmartSwitch is included, which should remove the possibility of an attacker installing "malicious software" on your device.</p><p>Elsewhere, Samsung states it has rolled in two fixes as part of its Semiconductor patch this month. The fixes were done in tandem with Google to solve critical vulnerabilities that could've negatively impacted your security.</p>

<p>The GalaxyClub post also mentions that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> is receiving an Android 14-based December security update in Europe (vS721BXXS3AXK6). The device is reportedly joined by the recent foldables: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and Fold 6 with versions F741BXXS2AXKC and F956BXXS2AXKC, respectively.</p><p>As previously stated, these updates are currently moving across the world, so keep your eyes peeled for them as we progress.</p><p>The December security patch is light, but that's likely because of what Samsung kicked off last week: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">the first One UI 7 beta</a>. While the S24 FE didn't get an invite, the rest of the flagship S24 series is in. The beta is using software based on Android 15 and features several new goodies. Samsung's announcement detailed the "Now Bar," which is lumped into the lock screen to see "important notifications dynamically" without opening your phone.</p><p>"Call Transcript" will automatically transcribe a recorded call in 20 (supported) languages. The Knox Matrix dashboard gives users more security insight into their connected devices alongside much more.</p><p>We've been sitting and waiting for One UI 7's beta through Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">multitude of delays</a> and it's finally here. While the exact time isn't certain, it appears that we can expect One UI 7's (Android 15) full release during the Galaxy S25 launch or shortly after.</p>

                    <p><p>Thinking of an AI Phone? Samsung's answer to that is its Galaxy S24 series — but its S24 Ultra is of a different breed. With a 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a fluid 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling and gaming looks pretty good. Pair that with the company's extensive lineup of Galaxy AI on-device tools and the S24 Ultra can help you through it all.</p></p>

It has long software support and exclusive AI features, a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, and a large display with S Pen support.

<p>Does OPPO have your attention yet? The company took what we loved from the OPPO Find X7 series, improved on it, and released the Find X8 and Find X8 Pro globally. That means if you're in Asia, Europe, or India, the OPPO Find X8 Pro might be a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra killer. Especially as the Galaxy S24 Ultra nears replacement by the Galaxy S25 series in 2025, is the Find X8 Pro the best Android phone you can buy right now?</p><p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">OPPO Find X8 Pro</a> is available in your region, the answer is likely yes. The smartphone has a powerful MediaTek processor, a quadruple-camera system with two periscope telephoto lenses, and more. If you're not sure whether to buy the Find X8 Pro or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, this breakdown will help you decide.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GmNeBRFgKk2gJUcXmDs76U" name="oppo-find-x8-pro-1.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmNeBRFgKk2gJUcXmDs76U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OPPO Find X8 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra are similarly sized powerhouses. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oppo-find-x8-series-is-taking-the-fight-to-the-iphone-16-globally">Find X8 Pro comes</a> with a 6.78-inch display, whereas the Galaxy S24 Ultra has a slightly larger 6.8-inch screen. However, the latter will almost certainly feel larger in the hand due to the Galaxy S24 Ultra's boxy design and sharp corners. The Find X8 Pro, meanwhile, measures 162.3 x 76.7 x 8.2 mm and its rounded corners and chamfered edges make for a more comfortable feel. At 162.3 x 79 x 8.6 mm, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is thicker and taller, too.</p><p>Notably, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is quite a bit heavier than the Find X8 Pro — there's an 18-gram disparity between the 215-gram OPPO flagship and the up-to-233-gram Samsung flagship. This is impressive, considering that the 5,910mAh battery inside the Find X8 Pro is significantly larger. The Galaxy S24 Ultra does have one trick up its sleeve: the inbuilt S Pen that can be used for quick drawing or note-taking on that large display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WGZFcwvp3vUr2yezPByNfN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-02.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGZFcwvp3vUr2yezPByNfN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of durability, the Galaxy S24 Ultra has Gorilla Armor covering the display, and it's a reinforced material with an anti-reflective coating. By comparison, the OPPO Find X8 Pro has Gorilla Glass 7i, but it does have the edge with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care"> IP69 water and dust-resistant rating</a>. That's higher than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean"> IP68 certification </a>of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the difference means that the Find X8 Pro is especially protected against high-temperature and high-pressure water jets — however unlikely they may be.</p>

<p>Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> have rear quadruple-camera systems, but they're arranged much differently for a unique look. Samsung's lenses are separate from each other, protruding from the back of the Galaxy S24 Ultra in the top-left corner. OPPO stuck with its classic circular-shaped camera housing, and it's centered on the back of the device.</p><p>You can get the Find X8 Pro in Space Black, Pearl White, and Blue colorways, and it's largely made of an aluminum frame. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-titanium-breakdown">Samsung uses titanium for the Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and you can buy the phone in Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Violet, Titanium Yellow, Titanium Blue, Titanium Green, and Titanium Orange.</p>

<p>MediaTek is often looked down upon as a lower-class chipmaker than Qualcomm, but that isn't the case heading into 2025. In fact, the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip inside the OPPO Find X8 Pro actually beats the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor inside the Galaxy S24 Ultra in benchmark tests. It's worth noting that the Find X8 Pro loses to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>-powered phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> will gain Qualcomm's latest chipset. But compared to the older Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Find X8 Pro is faster.</p><p>Both displays are similar — they're LTPO AMOLED panels supporting 120Hz refresh rates and HDR10+. However, as is a common occurrence, OPPO destroys Samsung in terms of peak brightness. The Find X8 Pro supports 4,500 nits peak brightness, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra is limited to 2,600 nits peak brightness. This will matter most in situations where you're using the phones outside in direct sunlight, but Samsung still has the anti-glare edge thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">Gorilla Armor</a>.</p><p>We can't forget about the Galaxy S24 Ultra's built-in stylus support, either, thanks to the S Pen. If you're looking for a phone with a pen inside, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is basically your only flagship offering.</p>

<p>OPPO's software support is improved, too, as the brand is now promising five years of full OS upgrades. It's still not quite on par with Samsung's seven-year promise for the Galaxy S24 Ultra, though. Additionally, Samsung has the edge in AI, and software overall. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oppo-coloros-15-advances-device-ai-google">ColorOS 15 on the Find X8 Pro</a> is based on Android 15, but has some OPPO quirks that may be jarring to longtime One UI users.</p>

<p>If you want a fantastic Android camera phone, the OPPO Find X8 Pro is a better option than the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It's still not quite as good as the Find X7 Ultra (keep waiting for the Find X8 Ultra if you want the absolute best camera) or Vivo X100 Ultra. Still, it's significantly better than the Galaxy S24 Ultra's camera hardware, which is aging. Crucially, the Find X8 Pro succeeds in areas where the Galaxy S24 Ultra specifically struggles, like quick shutter speeds and limited motion blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.</p><p>For hardware, the Find X8 Pro features a foursome of 50MP camera sensors. There's the 50MP, f/1.6 1/1.4-inch Sony Lytia LYT-808 main sensor, plus a 50MP, f/2.0 ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view. On top of that, you get not one, but <em>two</em> periscope telephoto lenses. One handles 3x optical zoom, and the other takes care of 6x optical zoom. Put simply, whether you're after stunning concert photos or basic stills, the Find X8 Pro should handle them all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rE4YGhpZYsVBh7ahzPSyhT" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-vs-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the camera lens bumps on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra vs S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rE4YGhpZYsVBh7ahzPSyhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra's camera specs look great on paper, highlighted by a 200MP, f/1.7 main sensor. However, megapixels aren't everything, and the Find X8 Pro's larger main sensor is actually better. Samsung does offer a capable duo of telephoto lenses, at 3x and 5x optical zoom. The phone's camera system simply doesn't impress compared to the likes of OPPO and Vivo heading into 2025.</p>

<p>The question of whether you should buy the OPPO Find X8 Pro or the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is an easy one. It's the Find X8 Pro, hands-down — if the phone is available in your region. The better question to ask is whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-leak-claims-oppos-find-x8-ultra-will-be-a-camera-beast">Find X8 Ultra</a> or Galaxy S25 Ultra are worth waiting for, and they just might be. For now, the Find X8 Pro represents some of the best hardware Android phones have to offer.</p>

<ul><li>Google's upcoming mid-range Pixel 9a surfaces again with real-life images.</li><li>The device appears to be carrying a new design, as seen in earlier leaked renders.</li><li>The Pixel 9a features dual cameras almost completely flushed on the back, unlike the predecessor models.</li></ul>
<p>Google Pixel leaks way ahead of launch have become quite common over the past couple of years. After seeing the possible renders of Pixel 9a already, we now have a good look at the prototype as well — thanks to a new leak.</p><p>The working prototype of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> has been spotted in the wild (via OnLeaks), revealing the familiar design we have seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">earlier leaked renders</a> of the upcoming mid-range handset from Google. It includes a taller screen with a punch hole cutout paired with flat sides and a new, flatter camera housing — an unexpected departure from the iconic bar camera module design, which has been the norm since the Pixel 6 series and has even received a redesign with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> models.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#Google #Pixel9a prototype surfaces once again...😏 https://t.co/snDYlyg3kJ pic.twitter.com/dVt24u8Kae<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1864950242795245860">December 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>As seen in the prototype, the new camera housing includes dual cameras nearly flush to the back of the phone, coupled with an LED flash that also resides flat to the back of the phone. The prototype handset further includes a matte finish and can be quite a fingerprint magnet, as seen in the images.</p><p>It isn’t the first time we have seen hands-on images of the Pixel 9a. Even before the leaked renders, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-alleged-real-life-photos-leak">alleged Pixel 9a handset</a> prototype was spotted on Facebook, and it looks nearly identical to the latest leaked prototype images. All this evidence points to Google circling out the new design element for the upcoming Pixel 9a, which will perhaps see the light of day sometime around Q2 2025 if previous Pixel A series releases are any indication.</p>
<p>The release is still significantly far away, but recent leaks have pointed out what to expect, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-color-options-leaked">color options</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-battery-capacity-pro-xl-leak">supposed battery capacity</a> of the Pixel 9a. The device is likely to comprise four colorways, including the previous Porcelain and Obsidian colors, next to the new Peony and Iris. The Peony is the latest addition to the Pixel 9 series, and it is an all-new pink color.</p><p>On the other hand, the Pixel 9a is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-dimension-display-size-rumors">rumored</a> to measure 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm, making the device slightly taller and wider than the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. However, the Pixel 9a's battery capacity should be close to 5000mAh — a significant 11% overall increase over the predecessor.</p>

<ul><li>A new report claims Samsung is looking ahead to the second half of 2025 to get its XR business moving with its AR glasses.</li><li>Sources suggest Samsung will produce ~20,000 AR glasses for a (potential) Q3 2025 launch before looking to Q4 for another ~30,000.</li><li>A recent patent listing showcased a brief outline of Samsung's planned AR glasses and additional details for its XR headset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors from South Korea have surfaced about Samsung's apparent 2025 plans for its XR venture.</p><p>Murmurings of Samsung's plans stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2DI1YO5LYZ">Sedaily</a> (Korean), claiming the company will enter "mass production" of an XR product in the "second half" of 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-manufacture-50000-xr-headsets-2025-launch/">SamMobile</a>). The publication cites "industry sources" in saying that Samsung views its XR business as something that will "follow" its smartphones in terms of revenue. Moreover, rumors claim that this product could be Samsung's AR glasses.</p><p>As such, rumors allege that the OEM is looking into beginning mass production of its XR device by Q3 2025 — potentially signaling a Q3 launch, as well. This start will supposedly involve the generation of roughly 20,000 devices. What's more, this number <em>could </em>rise; however, the publication's sources claim this is dependent on the AR glasses' market influence.</p><p>If all goes well, Samsung is rumored to prepare another ~30,000 AR glasses by Q4 2025 for the holidays. This puts the company at ~50,000 devices by the second half of next year, but certain variables could adversely or positively affect this prediction.</p><p>Elsewhere, sources state that Samsung is preparing to showcase a "sample" of its upcoming XR launch during Unpacked 2025 in January.</p>

<p>The last bit of that South Korean report is interesting, considering it doubles down on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped">previous report on Samsung's glasses</a>. Last week, rumors claimed that we might have a special preview of the company's augmented reality (AR) smart glasses during its next Unpacked event. Details aren't set in stone; however, there's a chance this preview could be a "short video or an image reveal."</p><p>The latest report claims that a "sample" of the device may be showcased during the event. Perhaps there's a chance we'll see a live demo on stage or some sort of live, hands-on demo with it. Samsung is expected to host this Galaxy Unpacked event in January 2025, where we will also see the Galaxy S25's debut.</p><p>Rumors of a pair of AR glasses have been few and far between as, aside from these recent reports, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">only other arrived late in 2023</a>. The glasses reportedly surfaced at the Intellectual Property Office in the U.K. under the Virtual reality headsets and Augmented reality headsets categories. Curiously, rumors back then suggested a similar number of mass-produced glasses (~30,000 to start) in 2024 — though that clearly didn't happen.</p><p>These glasses also appeared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-xr-headset-patent-filing-appearance">WIPO patent database listing</a> alongside Samsung's XR headset. The design was a brief outline, which likely detailed several components for functionality. Samsung's patent detailed the device as "AR glasses and/or a head-mounted device."</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Advanced subscribers can create and share Gems, which are custom AI chatbots aimed to help with specialized tasks.</li><li>Currently, Gems can only be shared using the Gemini web client.</li><li>Now, an APK teardown of the Google app beta reveals Gem sharing may be coming to mobile soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Since its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024 developer conference</a>, Google has been quickly ramping up Gemini's capabilities, trying to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Part of that effort included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-image-3-custom-gems-update-detailed">introducing Gems in August 2024</a>, which are custom AI chatbots designed to be "experts" in a specific area, according to Google. This functionality is only available for Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise subscribers, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-intros-custom-versions-of-chatgpt">rivals OpenAI's GPT Store</a>.</p><p>After creating a custom Gem, you can save and share it with others, but there's a catch. You can only share custom Gems via the Gemini web client, not through the Gemini mobile app or Google mobile app. There's evidence that might be changing, according from an APK teardown from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-gem-sharing-on-mobile-3506945/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. In <strong>beta version 15.49.40.sa.arm64</strong> of the Google app, the team discovered the ability to <strong>Share conversation and gem instructions</strong> in the mobile app.</p><p>The new option appears amongst the list of options in the action menu for Gemini, alongside the existing option to <strong>Share conversation</strong>. While it's still possible to simply share the Gemini conversation, there's now a separate button that will let you share the conversation and Gem instructions with one tap. Before creating a link with your Gem and current conversation, Google reminds users that this link will become public, and anyone with the link can see the name of the Gem and other information.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iP65fpHJeRht24DNN5wBan" name="Gem-Sharing-Mobile" alt="The sharing of custom Gems on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iP65fpHJeRht24DNN5wBan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new option will make it easier for people to share Gems they've created on mobile. The current workflow forces users to switch to the web client in order to share a Gem, which can be cumbersome. A change, if made public, would make the Gemini and Google apps even closer to the desktop experience in terms of feature parity. By all indications, the ability to create and share custom Gems will still remain a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">paid Gemini Advanced feature</a>.</p><p>It's unclear when the ability to share custom Gems on mobile would be available publicly. However, it's always a good sign that Google is making progress with a feature when it's functional as part of an app beta.</p>
