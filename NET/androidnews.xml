<ul><li>While users expect a sooner Galaxy S24 FE launch, a new leak reveals interesting color options.</li><li>The latest leak shows the device from all angles, including in Graphite, Blue, Green, and Yellow hues.</li><li>After FCC, the Galaxy S24 FE reaches WPC, pointing out the device's wired and wireless charging speeds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As Samsung is almost done with the major phone launches this year, the Fan Edition phone of the flagship series is yet to see the light of day. While we await the launch, a new leak reveals the device&apos;s design and some interesting specs.</p><p>You can see the full gallery of images over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-colors-renders-images.html">Android Headlines</a>, which has shared images of the upcoming Galaxy S24 FE color options, revealing the device in Blue, Graphite, Green, and Yellow. Per the renders, the upcoming mid-range phone from Samsung can also be seen from all angles, revealing an interesting flat design similar to the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, as opposed to the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, which featured slightly rounded corners and edges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="UeFPKLTfKuBBWJ8V9RboxB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-FE-leaked-render-colors.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 FE in four colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UeFPKLTfKuBBWJ8V9RboxB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new design appears to be a welcome change, and the colors look promising, too. Graphite looks interesting over regular black, while blue and green look more conventional. Yellow seems to be a new addition to the Galaxy S24 FE, and Samsung recently introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-now-comes-titanium-yellow">Yellow Titanium</a> shade as well.</p><p>The publication showcased five colors, but the Silver option appears missing. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-images-leak">earlier leak</a> (as shown in the featured image) also showcased the device&apos;s colorways. Samsung is likely to have the device ready in five color options when it launches.</p>

<p>Aside from the colors, both sides of the device will have a glass back. It will have a flat display with a punch hole cut out and thinner bezels measuring 1.99mm. The display will likely be 6.7 inches with Full HD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is expected to be up to 1900 nits and will be offered with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection.</p><p>Some of the specs were leaked earlier through marketing images. The device sports three rear cameras: a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and an 8MP telephoto sensor.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE SM-S721U appears on the Wireless Power Consortium website.⚡ 15 watt wireless charging ⚡ 25 watt wired charging#Samsung #GalaxyS24FE pic.twitter.com/XQwG3gduPc<a href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1831526478401696166">September 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S24 FE bearing the SM-S721U model number has reached the Wireless Power Consortium website, according to tipster Abhishek Yadav. This comes after the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-fe-fcc-certification-listing-launch-rumors">FCC certification</a>. The WPC not only confirmed the device&apos;s wireless and wired charging speeds but also confirmed its design. Per the certification, the device will have 15W wireless charging speed and 25W wired charging speed, which is still slow compared to the 2024&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a>, which feature ultra-fast charging speeds.</p><p>As for the launch, the Galaxy S24 FE is expected to unwrap in the coming weeks or months. For comparison, the predecessor came in the first week of October 2023.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims to have obtained information regarding the Galaxy Tab S10's pricing in Switzerland.</li><li>The rumor states the Tab S10 series will feature Wi-Fi and 5G connectivity and that the prices of both devices could jump by a couple hundred bucks.</li><li>The Tab S10 series is rumored to gain a "Galaxy AI key" for its keyboard accessories and is suspected to look awfully similar to the Tab S9.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s been rumored consistently that Samsung&apos;s next tablet series will only offer two devices; however, this new rumor claims it&apos;ll come at a higher cost.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra prices have reportedly come into the possession of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://svztechinfo.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-global-pricing-revealed/">svztechinfo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-tab-s10-prices-switzerland-leak/">SamMobile</a>). The publication claims that the prices regard Samsung&apos;s marketing of its tablets in Switzerland. Both devices will supposedly have two connectivity options: a Wi-Fi and a 5G variant.</p><p>Starting with the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, its Wi-Fi variant with 12GB (RAM) and 256GB (storage) will potentially go for 1179 CHF (~$1,389). The higher 12/512GB configuration will reportedly hit shelves for 1299 CHF (~$1,531).</p><p>For its 5G option, the Tab S10 Plus may see a 1319 CHF (~$1,554) price tag in Switzerland for the lower RAM/storage setup. The higher configuration may see 1419 CHF (~$1,672).</p><p>The publication claims the Ultra model will feature three RAM/storage choices: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/1TB. Its purported prices are as follows in order from lowest to highest configuration:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi</strong> - 1399 CHF (~$1,649)</li><li>1519 CHF (~$1,790)</li><li>1829 CHF (~$2,156)</li><li><strong>5G </strong>- 1549 CHF (~$,1826)</li><li>1669 CHF (~$1,967)</li><li>1979 CHF (~$2,332)</li></ul>

<p>As the publication noted, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Ultra</a> models featured the same RAM/storage and connectivity options. However, this time, it states the prices are roughly $170 to $200 higher than last year&apos;s Android tablets. It&apos;s worth advising that these U.S. estimates are truly <em>estimates</em> and that Samsung can always rework the pricing to fit the region.</p><p>Samsung has been rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">to focus on larger displays</a>, starting at 12 inches and ending at around 14.6 inches for the Ultra model. These tablets are expected to feature AMOLED screens alongside the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-s10-ultra-charging-speed-leak">boring charging speeds</a>. A rumor from August claims the tablets will continue to offer 45W wired fast charging. If consumers are looking for change, it seems that it will come from other areas, as 45W has become quite a trend for Samsung.</p><p>Speaking of, the Tab S10 duo was recently rumored to feature a change to its keyboard accessories in the form of a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-galaxy-ai-key-keyboard-rumor">Galaxy AI key</a>." The report claimed that the key would arrive for basic keyboard accessories and ones provided in cases. It&apos;s unclear what this key could look like, but speculation states the key would give users quick and easy access to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">provided Galaxy AI features</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Pixel Stand 2 was introduced alongside the Pixel 6 series and offered a streamlined charging experience and great software features for $79.</li><li>The charger wasn’t compatible with the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to the placement of its charging coils.</li><li>Now, it appears the Pixel Stand 2 is officially discontinued as it’s no longer available for purchase on the Google Store.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The charging speeds and compatibility offered by the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a> was a hot topic when the four phones were launched, and there’s a new development in the saga. After the Pixel Stand 2 was marketed as delivering the fastest wireless charging speeds for the Pixel 9 lineup, it is now “no longer available” from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google Store</a>. The apparent discontinuation comes after the Pixel Stand 2 was found to be incompatible with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> due to the placement of its charging coils.</p><p>As of Thursday, Sept. 5, people who tried to purchase a second-generation Pixel Stand from the Google Store found that the “add to cart” button was greyed out (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/05/google-pixel-stand-2nd-gen/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Other parts of the Google Store show that the product is “no longer available” or redirects to the store’s homepage. The Pixel Stand 2 is still available at third-party retailers, like Best Buy, as of Sept. 8. However, it’s unclear how long retail stock will last or whether new stock will become available when existing inventory runs out. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand 2</a> has been available for purchase since 2021, but things have gotten complicated as the Google Pixel lineup continued to expand. It’ll work with most Pixel phones, as well as select compatible models of Google Pixel Buds. However, the entire situation became finicky with the release of the original Pixel Fold last year. It only supported 7.5W of wireless charging, even when paired with the Pixel Stand 2.</p>

<p>Things somehow got worse with the release of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It’s better than the original Pixel Fold in just about every way — I’ve been using them side-by-side for about a week and can’t believe this is a generational jump. However, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is incompatible with the Pixel Stand 2 outright. Whereas most Pixel devices have centered wireless charging coils, the coils on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are placed lower. This means that, without coming up with a janky solution, the $1,800 Pixel 9 Pro Fold won’t work with the $80 Pixel Stand 2.</p><p>This development is disappointing as Google continues marching toward a complete ecosystem that can rival the likes of Apple and Samsung. However, people still use the Pixel Stand 2 for many reasons, including reliability and fast-charging support for most Pixel phones. However, the lack of support for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watches</a> has left some prospective buyers and current Pixel Stand 2 owners disappointed.</p><p>That leads us to the present. While the Pixel Stand 2 was available for purchase alongside the release of the entire Pixel 9 series, it’s now “no longer available.” The timing is strange, to say the least. It’s possible that Google saw the mixed response to the aging Pixel Stand 2’s compatibility concerns and decided to pull it altogether. If there was a Pixel Stand 3 ready and waiting, you’d think we would’ve seen it at August’s launch event. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> were showcased there and won’t be available until Sept. 26.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google about the Pixel Stand 2’s availability and the potential for a successor, but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article with more information if we receive a response.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MrDsyumahA4xLEVKAP5ykR" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-pixel-stand-v2-case-open.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro in charging case on Pixel Stand v2 with case open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MrDsyumahA4xLEVKAP5ykR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Due to the incompatibility of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with the Pixel Stand 2, I’ll admit that I’m surprised we didn’t see a redesigned Pixel Stand 3 arrive at last month’s Made by Google event. The fact that a successor didn’t arrive alongside the Pixel 9 series and how the Pixel Stand 2 was seemingly discontinued quietly doesn’t give me much hope that we’ll see another Pixel Stand. I hope to be wrong because the Pixel Stand 2 was one of the better first-party chargers out there, thanks to its elegant look and unique software features.</p><p>The other reason why I’m doubtful we’ll get a Pixel Stand 3 is due to how large the Pixel lineup has become. When the second-generation Pixel Stand first debuted, Google only sold a few very similar phone models each year. Now, the Pixel lineup is massive. Google introduced four phones last month alone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> is presumably still on the way. Five phones per year, multiple pairs of earbuds, a tablet, and two smartwatches make the Pixel lineup tough to cover with a single charging accessory.</p><p>The varying sizes and form factors in the Pixel family today make it hard for a single charging stand to fit them all. Rather than offering a charging stand, I wonder if a charging pad could be in the works. Samsung does that with some of its wireless chargers, and it means that a variety of phones, earbuds, and other products can charge comfortably—regardless of the exact placement of their charging coils.</p><p>Still, I know there are <em>a lot</em> of people who love the Pixel Stand, so there’s certainly a market for the Pixel Stand 3 if Google can work out some of the kinks.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's next flagship Galaxy S25 Ultra renders are out showcasing its design.</li><li>It will likely have more flatter sides than the predecessor and cameras similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</li><li>The latest leak also reveals interesting camera specs of the upcoming Ultra model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After carrying similar design elements for the last two models, Samsung is likely trying to spice things up next year with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Thanks to a new leak, the first possible renders of the flagship phone are now out, revealing some exciting design changes.</p><p>Prolific leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka OnLeaks, has revealed new renders of the Galaxy S25 Ultra in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">Android Headlines</a>. In these renders, we can see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> from all angles with the latest design changes.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad... Here finally comes your very first and very early look at the #Samsung #GalaxyS25Ultra (360° video + stunning 5K renders + dimensions)!😏On behalf of @Androidheadline 👉🏻 https://t.co/6oqZVqQlMI pic.twitter.com/RTDbuVeVrc<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1833524605006336407">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The primary difference between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, is the frame, which appears to be completely flat. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has a slight curve on its sides, while the top and bottom are more or less completely flat, but the S25 Ultra appears to be flat across the entire frame. </p><p>Another interesting element is that Samsung appears to be slowly moving away from the previous look of its rear camera lenses in favor of all-black sensors. This approach appears similar to what we have seen on the latest Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>That said, we should take the renders with a grain of salt, as Iceuniverse points out that there are some mistakes with the render, including the design of the cameras.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks to Onleaks for providing us with the S25 Ultra rendering based on CAD.

<p>Speaking of, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is believed to carry the 200MP H2 primary camera accompanied by a 50MP ISOCELL JN3 sensor acting as an ultra-wide-angle lens, notes Android Headlines. Users will also see the 10MP IMX754 lens acting as a 3x telephoto camera and another 50MP IMX584 lens acting as another 5x telephoto lens.</p>

<p>The publication further notes that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be lighter in hand, weighing around 219 grams, while the previous iteration weighed 232 grams. With the new design, the upcoming Ultra will also appear smaller, although it will retain the same screen size as the S24 Ultra. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimensions-leak">A recent leak</a> also revealed the dimensions of the phone, pointing to a thinner device.</p><p>Like the previous Ultra models, the upcoming model will feature the same 5000mAh battery and, again, support up to 45W wired charging. Other expected specifications include the yet-to-be-launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset. Interestingly, the renders also seem to omit the S Pen, although it seems likely it will be included with a dedicated slot as previous models have been.</p><p>Per the latest renders, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will have a boxy overall look, flatter sides with a glossy finish, and a tad bit lighter to go easy on your hands. The launch of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is still several months away, and these are the first renders that showed up today, so we expect to consider these renders with a grain of salt.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>HMD has a new phone on the horizon, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/hmd-fusion?sku=101SQ503H043">HMD Fusion</a>. If you simply look at the tech specs, it&apos;s a decidedly middle-of-the-road device with a great $299 price tag and a few great additions like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">easy repairability</a> and a 5,000 mAh battery, but those aren&apos;t the greatest things about the phone. That would be the metal pins across the bottom rear of the phone and what they represent.</p>
<p>The Fusion is not really a modular phone because you simply can&apos;t build one; some parts are permanent. Instead, we get the next best thing. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-mods">Motorola&apos;s Moto Mod system</a> before it, you can switch out the back of the Fusion with customizable shells that are integrated with the phone&apos;s OS, software, and hardware.</p><p>Some of the shells HMD has announced are mostly cosmetic and colorful, while others offer a degree of functionality like a ruggedized body or integrated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2 charging</a>. Others, like a gamepad or a shell with a ring light integrated right into the camera app, bring features to the Fusion that wouldn&apos;t otherwise exist.</p>
<p>And still, that&apos;s not the best part. The system is fully open hardware. Everything you need to design a shell and develop software to power something new and different is free from HMD and free for you to use to make your own products. Using free resources from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/fusion-development-toolkit-download">HMD</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/">Google</a> alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-apps-3d-printing-hit-or-miss-tons-fun">a 3D printer</a> is all you need to design and develop something great—or at least great to you.</p><p>The one problem is that this innovation comes from a small player like HMD. I like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">what HMD has been trying lately</a>, and I think its products offer good value when it comes to buying a nice phone. There are things I don&apos;t care for, and no company is perfect, but I&apos;m warming up to its products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.13%;"><img id="ETn6QVPvMddEasEA6uXXck" name="HMD FUSION ALL OUTFITS & GAMING.jpg" alt="HMD Fusion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETn6QVPvMddEasEA6uXXck.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But let&apos;s be honest for a moment; nothing a company like HMD does will make much of a difference. There are three companies making phones that matter: Samsung, Apple, and Google. For the actual hardware and feature set, even Google doesn&apos;t make much of a splash, and it is important only because it fosters Android itself.</p><p>There&apos;s always a chance that a phone like the Fusion will gain attention, but it&apos;s a very slim chance. With an idea this good, that&apos;s a shame. The people working for Samsung who design phones are incredibly bright and full of ideas, but somewhere out there is someone who would do something better because they&apos;re doing it for fun. They aren&apos;t working; they&apos;re just trying things because they can. Without any budget to adhere to, a person with some simple tools and a curious mind can do something <em>better</em> than all the engineers at a company like Samsung.</p>
<p>We see some innovation from companies that are doing things differently every year. None of it ever matters because the Samsungs of the world refuse to take a chance the same way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-oneplus-3-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">OnePlus did</a> back in the day or the way HMD is doing right now.</p><p>I&apos;d love to buy a Galaxy model designed for makers and tinkerers. I already spend a lot of my free time goofing around with electronics, and it&apos;s a large part of my background. I don&apos;t know what I could "invent," but I know I would have a lot of fun while trying and failing. And I know I&apos;m not alone.</p><p>Instead, I&apos;ll be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/hmd-fusion/buy?sku=101SQ503H043">buying an HMD Fusion</a> when it goes on sale here in the U.S. later this year. If you like to "mess" with stuff, you might want to do the same.</p>

<ul><li>Google is beta testing new customization of the Android Search widget, which would give users the chance to add a desired "Shortcut."</li><li>It seems the widget will soon receive a <strong>+</strong> icon so users can add one of five shortcuts ranging from translation to music lookup.</li><li>The idea of a music lookup shortcut reminds us of Circle to Search, which can now listen to your on-device audio to find a song's title.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has placed more focus on improving the customization and ease of its Android OS and a recent discovery points toward another addition.</p><p>During an APK dive of the Google app&apos;s recent <strong>v15.35.41.29</strong> beta, AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-search-widget-shortcut-3479864/">Android Authority</a>) found an upcoming update for the Search widget. Currently, the widget displays the colorful "G" logo on the left, followed by the microphone and Lens icons on the right.</p><p>The tipster discovered that Google wants to add a plus (<strong>+</strong>) icon on the left side of the microphone option.</p><p>In testing, the post states tapping the icon will send users to the Search widget&apos;s "Customize" page. At the bottom, the beta displays a "Choose a Shortcut" section packed with potentially useful options. Users can opt to pop in a logo for Google Translate (text only), Song/music lookup, Weather, Translate (images), and Finance.</p><p>Of course, users can leave this blank if they&apos;re not using the widget that often or prefer not to use it all. The publication anticipates a rollout of the Search widget&apos;s shortcut option to happen sooner rather than later.</p><p>The widget has one minor issue: it&apos;s not <em>saving </em>the desired shortcut, though that can be chalked up to its testing environment. We&apos;re likely awaiting a quick patch or server-side flip to switch on before we see this feature (if Google proceeds).</p>

<p>Android users already have a few customization choices for the Search widget. It&apos;s relatively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-google-search-widget">easy to add them</a> once the widget is on your home screen. Users can alter the style of the widget, its color (hue/saturation), and its level of transparency.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to see Song/music lookup as an option for Google&apos;s Android Search widget. Last week, the company rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-september-2024-feature-drop">Android September updat</a>e, which packed a few new features, including one for Circle to Search. The convenient search feature received music lookup. Users watching videos or listening to audio on their device could activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and it&apos;ll "listen" in on what&apos;s playing.</p><p>After a brief moment, the software will display some relevant search results. Similarly, the feature is said to be able to hear audio from external sources and run its song lookup that way.</p><p>Although, including song search on the Search widget could help devices without Circle to Search as it remains <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/circle-to-search-coming-to-more-android-phones-in-october">woefully exclusive to Pixel and Galaxy</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Oppo is plotting a big return with the Find X8, expected to launch later this year, and ahead of the unveiling, the phone has made a surprise appearance.</p><p>Reliable leaker Digital Chat Station has shared the first real-world photos of the Oppo Find X8 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OwjLaeNRJ" target="_blank">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://playfuldroid.com/oppo-find-x8-real-life-images-emerge-before-next-months-launch/" target="_blank">PlayfulDroid</a>). But the phone is placed in a case that looks like a shipping box insert, so we can’t see much of the front design yet.</p><p>Fortunately, a prior leak shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/998/998600.htm" target="_blank">MyDrivers</a> revealed a device that seems to incorporate flattened edges, reminiscent of the recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>.</p><p>However, the images don’t show the back of the phone. But the leaker did confirm that the Oppo Find X8 will run on ColorOS 15 with only a few tweaks.</p><p>Even with the limited visuals, the leaker revealed that Xiao Bu, the onboard AI assistant, will support vertical page flipping. Plus, the new images reveal a notification shade that echoes Apple&apos;s Dynamic Island design. It stretches around the selfie camera cutout, adding both style and functionality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.07%;"><img id="qJLPKKx2BuzbpABEzRCBSU" name="Oppo-Find-X8-leak.jpg" alt="Oppo Find X8 leaked photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJLPKKx2BuzbpABEzRCBSU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="518" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Digital Chat Station / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The leaked images hint that the overall UI design hasn’t changed much. While the AI assistant and notification shade got some upgrades, most of the icons look the same, according to Digital Chat Station.</p><p>Rumor has it the Oppo Find X8 will feature a 6.5-inch flat OLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s set to include an advanced optical in-display fingerprint scanner and a big 5,600 mAh battery.</p><p>Fast charging is on the menu too, with speeds between 80W and 100W, plus wireless charging could make the cut.</p><p>The Find X8 lineup is expected to include three versions: the standard model, Find X8 Pro, and Find X8 Ultra.

<ul><li>Huawei has launched the first tri-fold phone in China with an immersive, tablet-like 10.2-inch experience when fully unfolded.</li><li>The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design features a textured leather back panel with a circular, triple camera array consisting of a 50MP primary lens with OIS and a f/1.4 aperture.</li><li>The device is available in China for a starting price of ¥19,999 (~$2,808). </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design has officially launched as the world&apos;s first tri-fold phone, and it&apos;s not cheap.</p><p>Huawei&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/mate-xt-ultimate-design/">Mate XT</a> features a textured leather backing and gold finishes around its design. With rounded corners, the Chinese OEM looks to create a comfortable experience no matter the orientation. When fully closed and used as a single screen, the Mate XT features a 6.4-inch OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate and 1,440Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate.</p><p>Users can unfold the phone&apos;s display once to expand the viewing experience to 7.9 inches. Finally, when Huawei&apos;s tri-fold device is fully open, users will find an immersive, tablet-like 10.2-inch display. This final display measurement enables 3K resolution and Huawei&apos;s "golden" screen ratio of 16:11.</p><p>Huawei stresses that users can utilize the Mate XT in any configuration (singular, double, or triple) and that the device OS will accommodate their choice. When folded, the phone measures 12.8mm in thickness, less than a full millimeter thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. With the dual-screen view, it measures 7.45mm at its thickest point, and when fully unfolded, it measures as little as 3.6mm thick.</p><p>Durability is a hot topic, so the company states its screens feature a "composite" laminated structure. This reportedly keeps the phone&apos;s displays thin while retaining enough strength to withstand wear and tear. Similarly, the company developed a new hinge structure that achieves "internal and external bending for the first time." Huawei says that its dual-track system aids in stable folding/unfolding.</p>

<p>The circular camera array offers three lenses: a 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and a 12MP periscope lens. Huawei touts its XMAGE imaging system on the Mate XT and that its rear array offers 10 variable aperture levels. The primary lens can go from f/1.4 to f/4.0, likely aiding users in taking photos in various lighting conditions and focal points.</p><p>The device&apos;s front-facing selfie camera has an 8MP lens. The Mate XT only has one forward-facing camera, and it&apos;s positioned on the initial singular display before unfolding.</p><p>Huawei has implemented a few key features on the Mate XT, such as those with a heavy AI background. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> tools can help users "write, polish, or translate" text and edit pictures. Moreover, the company&apos;s AI assistant can be surfaced and used in split screen mode.</p><p>Additionally, the Mate XT features Tiantong Satellite Communication. This isn&apos;t the first Huawei phone to use satellite communication, and a similar method has been seen on the likes of Google&apos;s Pixel 9 through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/satellite-sos-launches-demo-pixel-9">Satellite SOS</a>. Huawei&apos;s version is expected to function similarly as consumers can keep in touch with important contacts even without a cellular signal.</p>

<p>Huawei has included its HarmonyOS 4.2, 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of internal storage in the Mate XT.</p><p>Energy-wise, the tri-fold contains a thin silicon-based 5,600mAh battery. Huawei parades its "long-lasting" abilities but doesn&apos;t offer information about how much time users may get from it. It&apos;s entirely likely that the battery&apos;s longevity will depend on how many screens you&apos;re using and to what extent. However, the phone receives 66W wired fast charging and 50W wirelessly charging.</p><p>Huawei&apos;s Mate XT Ultimate Design has launched in China, starting at ¥19,999 (~$2,808). Consumers can purchase the device in a red or black colorway. It&apos;s unclear if this device will see a global debut.</p>

<ul><li>Apple is one of the only major tech brands that continues to pre-record their tech events.</li><li>While most companies sidelined their in-person events and live demos during and after the pandemic, many have returned to normalcy with vibrant and engaging gatherings.</li><li>Instead, Apple's events feel more like prolonged ads, and it has opened the door for Google to hold more exciting tech product launches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier this year, I had the privilege of watching DJ and robe-wearer Marc Rebillet jump out of a giant coffee cup to serenade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a> attendees with AI-generated sounds bright and early. I promise that isn&apos;t the reason I&apos;m ready to admit that Google has leapfrogged Apple in terms of product launch quality and engagement, and yesterday&apos;s underwhelming iPhone 16 "Glowtime" event proves it.</p><p>Whether you&apos;re a fan of Google&apos;s pre-show antics or not — it was certainly an interesting experience to watch Rebillet work at 9 a.m. with the rest of the Android Central crew at I/O — there&apos;s something to be learned from them. Google is willing to take risks in 2024 that Apple isn&apos;t, and anyone who studies Apple knows that it is a company built on taking risks. Made by Google events include various kinds of risks, from live demos that can and do go awry to leaving thousands of journalists and devs perplexed by a dancing DJ at I/O 2024. </p><p>I&apos;m not here to say that Google is perfect. The company announces, beta tests, cancels, releases, and re-names so many products and AI features that some of its events feel more like a corporate earnings call than a consumer product showcase. </p><p>Whether you love or hate the brand&apos;s events, it&apos;s clear that Google doesn&apos;t lack in the risk-taking and personality departments. Showcases at Google I/O and Made by Google events — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> launch event last month — have both, specifically with live demos that manage to be engaging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rkTimGqWSxwKk73NPtRRXT" name="Google-IO-2024-pickleball-gemini-question.jpeg" alt="Google engineer using Gemini to ask a question about Pickelball" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rkTimGqWSxwKk73NPtRRXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you watched Apple&apos;s "Glowtime" event yesterday, where we got a better look at Apple Intelligence and a few new products, you probably noticed that it was devoid of both. There wasn&apos;t an ounce of the personality, risk-taking, or flair that Apple events were characterized by in the past. </p><p>Everything was pre-recorded for yet another year. In fact, if you look closely, I&apos;d say that CEO Tim Cook and SVP Craig Federighi were the only two presenters who delivered their lines in a way that was remotely engaging or natural. The pre-recorded and scripted talking points combined with cinematic montages made the entire Apple event feel like an hour-plus-long advertisement. The opening testimonials about how people use Apple products and services every day feel cliché at this point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d" name="visual-intelligence-iphone-16-pro-1.jpeg" alt="Apple Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2268" height="1276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It doesn&apos;t help that the announcements from yesterday&apos;s event were meager at best. We didn&apos;t get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-ultra-3">Apple Watch Ultra 3</a>, which means prospective buyers are in a weird spot, forced to choose between an Ultra 2 (now in black... thanks, Apple) and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-x-everything-you-need-to-know">Series 10</a>. The AirPods Max got a laughably small update, with USB-C and new colors but the same hardware and exorbitant price tag. And we have AirPods 4 now, but with ANC and non-ANC versions, the lineup is more convoluted than ever.</p><p>Of course, the highlight of "Glowtime" was certainly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-release-date-rumors-news-and-more">iPhone 16 series</a>, but even that was lackluster. It&apos;s great that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-pro-release-date-rumors-news-and-more">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max now share the same camera system, and I&apos;m thrilled to trade in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> for the smaller model. The other improvements, like the Camera Control button and larger Pro screen sizes, didn&apos;t speak to me. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1853px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="wi5AHaiCwrBHXZVwrBa9KM" name="capture-button-iphone-16-pro.jpeg" alt="Capture Control button on the iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wi5AHaiCwrBHXZVwrBa9KM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1853" height="1042" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have to wonder whether Apple&apos;s product development is really stalling or if it&apos;s losing its touch with pre-recording events. There were tons of slides and b-roll showcasing the Camera Control button in action, but would a live demo from Tim Cook at Apple Park have been more engaging and appealing to journalists and customers alike?</p><p>The answer is probably a mix of both possibilities. All I know is that, as an Apple user at Android Central, I came into "Glowtime" looking to make an upgrade. My AirPods Max are too heavy, and I can&apos;t stand the Lightning connector in 2024. My time with the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been generally poor. Yet, I came away less intrigued by Apple&apos;s event than I had been by product launches by Motorola, Samsung, and Google in the months prior. </p>

<p>Apple&apos;s pre-recorded events simply come off as boring ads these days. Samsung has a weird obsession with inviting influencers and creators to its launch events, only for them to go back to their iPhones a few days later. Anyone remember the Pokimane saga from a recent Galaxy Unpacked event? To say it plainly, neither Apple or Samsung are winning in the product launch game in 2024. </p><p>It might be hard to believe, but it&apos;s Google that is holding the best tech events nowadays. The company is doing pretty impressive things with hardware and software, it&apos;s willing to take risks with live demos, and has plenty of personality with its marketing messaging. Despite all the nonsense, Google&apos;s events are the only ones I get excited to watch, and the company has truly flipped the script.</p>

But life eventually caught up to me, and a combination of age and the unique strains of modern life caused me to finally visit an optometrist last Spring. While I&apos;m wearing glasses throughout the day now, a new solution from Honor could help reduce that glasses usage over time using, you guessed it, AI.</p><p>AI has been a bit of an annoying buzzword this year, but every so often a new feature breaks through all the noise and presents a solution that&apos;s <em>actually</em> a solution, not just some minor new form of convenience. Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">previously announced</a> its new AI defocus tech for the upcoming Honor Magic V3 foldable phone, but I can confirm it&apos;s also on the new Honor MagicPad 2 tablet.</p><p>Myopia is quickly becoming a global issue, as experts predict that it will affect 50% of the world&apos;s population by 2050. Honor is only one brand, and while wider adoption of this kind of technology could slow down or even reverse this negative trend entirely, optometrists I spoke with said this kind of therapy only works best for certain age groups.</p><p>I&apos;ve been testing out Honor&apos;s AI defocus tech on both the MagicPad 2 and Magic V3 for the past few weeks and it&apos;s impressive just how transparently it works. Few companies are taking eye care as seriously as Honor—something that&apos;s particularly personal to me as I&apos;ve been dealing with display-induced headaches due to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>—and the company&apos;s latest devices are a bastion of relief in a world where displays are meant to bedazzle but ultimately hurt us.</p>

<p>Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a problem created when eyes grow longer in order to better focus on objects that are arm&apos;s length or closer to them. In a world where we&apos;re constantly looking at monitors or smartphones for long periods of time throughout the day, it&apos;s not hard to understand why this is a (literal) growing problem.</p><p>But smartphone or monitor usage isn&apos;t going away in the modern age, but instead of just relying on glasses usage to fix the problem, Honor is taking a two-pronged approach. The company just introduced the first nearwork-induced transient myopia-reducing display on both the Honor Magic V3 folding phone and the Honor MagicPad 2 tablet.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>An estimated 50% of the world's population will have myopia (nearsightedness) by 2050 if something isn't done to reverse the trend.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>These special displays use a combination of advanced OLED display technology and AI scene understanding to recreate the effects of Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segments (DIMS) lenses, which have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjo.bmj.com/content/104/3/363">scientifically proven</a> to slow down the elongation of the eye.</p><p>In a document provided to Android Central, Honor links to several pieces of related research that show how simulated defocus solutions can help improve the eyes of anything from tree shrews to human adults when used regularly over a period of anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 weeks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.71%;"><img id="3fFqsd49vEtjBzppD6Ebc9" name="bjophthalmol-2020-March-104-3-363-F3.large.jpg" alt="A chart showing the effectiveness of DIMS lenses in slowing progression of childhood myopia" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fFqsd49vEtjBzppD6Ebc9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2022" height="621" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A chart showing the effectiveness of DIMS lenses in slowing progression of childhood myopia </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: British Journal of Ophthalmology)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Special glasses can help reverse myopia, and Honor's solution aims to replicate these types of lenses as closely as possible via clever display technology.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The technology works by separating colors and keeping some in focus while "defocusing" others. There are also times when colors are changed or objects receive faint outlines that place them more or less in focus, depending on the color used. It&apos;s similar to chromatic aberration, a lens effect that separates colors via a prism, which can also be seen in 3D movies that provide artificial depth.</p><p>In essence, it simulates the act of looking away from your device at a distant object, helping to automate a process that most of us forget to do.</p><p>It&apos;s difficult to describe and even more difficult to understand unless you see it in action. Surprisingly, I didn&apos;t find that this affected image quality negatively. While I had a hard time capturing the effect on camera, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c5VtgEP43Y">YouTuber PhoneBuff</a> did an excellent job of tearing the technology apart in an easy-to-understand way in the video below.</p><p>He even corroborates the notion that the effect is normally nearly invisible to the naked eye in most circumstances, which I found particularly interesting. The big downside is that Honor&apos;s AI Defocus tech currently only works on the YouTube and Amazon Kindle apps, but Honor says it&apos;s working to expand support for more apps in the near future.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0c5VtgEP43Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that this could be a one-stop-shop solution. According to Bhavin Shah, Behavioural Optometrist at Central Vision Opticians, DIMS therapy—remember, those are the physical defocus lenses that people can wear—is generally only used in people up to age 21 and sees only a 1% success rate beyond that age.</p><p>Shah says "I don&apos;t believe that stimulating the same defocus on a screen will be detected by the peripheral retinal in the same way that the actual light hits the retina through glasses or contact lenses. I&apos;ve worn these contact lenses and glasses myself as an adult and it did not make any difference to comfort or eyestrain, the vision is much better with regular glasses or contacts compared to wearing defocus lenses."</p><p>Honor has been very careful to pen this as one additional arrow in the quiver for better eye health rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. But while it&apos;s not going to work for everyone, it may help quite a few people, and Honor&apos;s own research—plus Shah&apos;s experience—seems to corroborate the possibility.</p><p>Shah seemed hopeful about the tech so long as the study included a proper control mechanism for testers, meaning one group has the defocus AI mode enabled while one has it disabled. "If this change was better than those not using the defocus mode, then it shows some minor benefit. However, a long-term independent study would be the next step before I would start recommending it. I would have to try it myself."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Honor has been very careful to pen this as one additional arrow in the quiver for better eye health rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, but some experts say we need more testing to make sure it's effective.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Shah notes that "our eyes do have a system where only the central vision is clear and the peripheral part is blurred and the eyes keep moving and pointing the central part of the vision to build up a clear picture by joining the clear parts and ignoring the blur, so in theory, if the peripheral defocus were to move based on where a person is viewing the screen at any one time, there may be some effect but I would highly doubt that it would make a significant difference."</p><p>I&apos;ve seen similar mixed results in the PWM-sensitive communities on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ledstrain.org/">LEDStrain forum</a> and in Telegram groups I&apos;m a part of, where one "flicker-free" solution works wonders for some people while it does absolutely nothing to help another person.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5S4HdrkVU9qB8aimhFhg5" name="honor-magicpad-2-reading-01.jpg" alt="Reading books on an Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5S4HdrkVU9qB8aimhFhg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Honor MagicPad 2 utilizes DC-like dimming at high brightness and an impressive 4320Hz PWM dimming at low brightness. For reference, that&apos;s 20x better than the latest iPad Pro models. Even this solution won&apos;t work perfectly for everyone, but it can help quite a lot of people who are sensitive to light flicker, like myself.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This won't help everyone but, combined with higher PWM rates and other eye care solutions, mean that Honor is pushing the envelope for eye care more than any other brand.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Shah offered one particular ray of hope based on Honor&apos;s research results, though. "Central Choroidal thickness has been shown to increase with near work and then return to normal but there is only a little research on this subject and the impact it has on adults and eyestrain."</p><p>AI Defocus solutions like the one in the Honor MagicPad 2 and Honor Magic V3 are designed to keep Central Choroidal thickness from changing as little as possible, meaning our eyes likely won&apos;t be as negatively affected by long-term screen use if more people are able to use this kind of technology.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-better-eye-health-2">The road to better (eye) health</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MwTw3oahEAVMqGJPqoJpFo" name="honor-magicpad-2-reading-close.jpg" alt="Reading books on an Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MwTw3oahEAVMqGJPqoJpFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For this article, I spoke with three different eye care professionals and all agreed that less screen time is the best solution. Dr. James R. Kelly from Kelly Vision Center recommends a simple 20/20/20 vision break rule along with frequent blinking when working on screens or using your tablet or phone for a long time. The 20/20/20 rule "means taking a visual break every 20 minutes where the individual looks at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds."</p><p>Frequent blinking might sound funny, but it&apos;s been shown that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hub.salford.ac.uk/appliedcognition/2021/08/27/2068/">blinking decreases by 66%</a> when focusing on something. Additional research has shown that the blink rate for displays versus books <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24413278/">isn&apos;t any different</a>, but few people—in the past or otherwise—would spend as much time reading a book as often as most people look at a computer monitor or smartphone, meaning most of us don&apos;t blink as often as we should.</p><p>Shah builds upon this specifically for children, saying "it would be better to give them better habits like cutting screen time, taking breaks, and holding the device further away." In fact, new smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> encourage not only fun outdoor play but also reduced screen time, setting hard limits on games to only a few minutes of screen time per session.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QPiwKDd47VagREzJKrkYv7" name="honor-magicpad-2-watching-youtube.jpg" alt="Watching a YouTube video on the Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QPiwKDd47VagREzJKrkYv7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But while kids can get away with reduced screen time, it&apos;s not a reality for most working adults in the modern age. Dr. Kelly recommends "proper distancing and angling of screens, along with blue light blocking filters and anti-glare filters, and making sure screens are clean and smudge-free to reduce glare and reflections."</p><p>Samsung actually took a fascinating step toward this last part with the display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, giving it anti-glare properties but the company didn&apos;t go far enough to reduce the amount of flicker coming from its relatively slow 480Hz PWM rate. Remember, Honor is pushing 10x that number on its phones and tablets.</p><p>Additionally, Dr. Kelly recommends proper room lighting to avoid eye fatigue and strain. I&apos;ve personally had to remove all smart lights and LED strips from my home office because nearly <em>all</em> of them use PWM dimming and flicker at all brightness levels. I&apos;ve since switched them out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019KKEXOE/">these Sylvania LED bulbs</a> from Amazon that are not only inexpensive but are also non-dimmable, which is usually the code word in the LED world for "doesn&apos;t use PWM."</p>

<p>My verdict on the Honor MagicPad 2 and Honor Magic V3 displays? Superb. Sublime, even. The MagicPad 2 has the better display because it&apos;s a more consistent PWM rate at low brightness. It uses true 4320Hz PWM at low brightness whereas only the inner display in the Magic V3 has true 4320Hz—the outer display is identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>&apos;s 3840Hz panel, which uses an accelerated 360Hz DC-like cycle to achieve a higher overall PWM frequency.</p><p>Either way, I&apos;ve had no discomfort from either device after weeks of use, which is a lot more than I can say about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. If all else fails, the only other real solution is just to spend more time outdoors and less time in front of screens.</p>
