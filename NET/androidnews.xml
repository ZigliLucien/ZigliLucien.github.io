<ul><li>Google is rolling out a minor update to Android 15 Beta testers, Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, ahead of the update's expected public release next month.</li><li>Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 includes bug fixes and other improvements, and is available for Google Pixel 6 and newer devices, including Pixel Tablet.</li><li>The update comes as most beta testers have already moved to Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is sending a minor update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta testers as it gears up to release Android 15 QPR1 publicly next month. The update, Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gxhqu3/android_15_qpr1_beta_31_now_available/" target="_blank">announced</a> today in a Reddit post. It includes bug fixes and improves overall stability, and is available for Google Pixel 6 and newer phones, plus the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>.</p><p>For users enrolled in the Android Beta Program, the update will be sent automatically over-the-air. The build number for Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 is <strong>AP41.240925.012</strong>. However, Google notes that users will only get this update if they're enrolled in the beta program and are still running Android 15 QPR1. Those that have updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-1-pixel-test-start">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a>, or manually flashed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a>, won't need Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gxhqu3/android_15_qpr1_beta_31_now_available">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>There are no known new features or major changes in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, and that's not surprising, as beta testers are already looking ahead to Android 15 QPR2. However, there are a few bug fixes that will be appreciated by anyone still on Android 15 QPR1. That includes a fix for NFC payment failures, a problem that has plagued various pre-release versions of Android 15 for months.</p><p>Here are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes-qpr1" target="_blank">full release notes</a> for Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, provided by Google:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where tapping media controls closed the notification shade but didn't open the app. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/375447625">Issue #375447625</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue where long pressing the device entry icon didn't work when there were many notifications and the notification shelf was overlapping the lock icon. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/369316295">Issue #369316295</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented proper volume control for some Bluetooth devices. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/376650439">Issue #376650439</a>,<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/373681731">Issue #373681731</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the Material You, wallpaper-derived color options to be very similar. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/378507373">Issue #378507373</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the scrollbar in the system settings to be sized and styled inconsistently. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/366278155">Issue #366278155</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused NFC payments to fail. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/363914347">Issue #363914347</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue where translations in Indonesian and Hebrew didn't display correctly for apps that are targeting Android 14 (API level 34) or lower. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/378200084">Issue #378200084</a>)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, camera, connectivity, localization, accessibility, and interactivity.</li></ul>
<p>This appears to be simply a quick tune-up for Android 15 QPR1 as Google prepares to release it publicly. It's largely the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-3-bluetooth-foldable-update">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3</a>, plus the bug fixes, which was the last QPR1 beta release that hit testers nearly a month ago.</p>

<p>Outside of fitness trackers, you'll also find some Black Friday Fitbit deals on its smartwatches: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Fitness-Smartwatch-Included/dp/B0B4MV1TGL"><strong>Fitbit Sense 2 is $179.95 ($70 off)</strong></a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4MWCFV4"><strong>Fitbit Versa 4 is $119.95 ($80 off)</strong></a>. Both watches have technically fallen lower <em>once</em> in their deal history — the Versa 4 at $104 and the Sense 2 at $139 — but they're both at the <em>second-lowest</em> price we've ever seen.</p><p>Because Google has all but confirmed that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">won't make any more Fitbit-branded watches</a>, focusing on the expensive, short-lived, and Android-only Pixel Watches, the Sense 2 and Versa 4 are the best you're going to get, as long as they remain in stock. But despite its age, the Sense 2 remains an excellent option for health tracking paired with a gorgeous AMOLED display, while the Versa 4 is more stripped down but very affordable at this price.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6"><strong>Watch 6 40mm ($139.99, or 53% off)</strong></a> has never come close to this price; last week, it was $169! Now, you can play chicken with Samsung and hope it falls even lower by next week, or you can snag one now before it goes out of stock for good.</p><p>The only reason not to buy the Galaxy Watch 6 is if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQKDML"><strong>Galaxy Watch 7 at $205 (32% off)</strong></a>.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is objectively better than the Watch 6, but I know that most people deal-hunting on Black Friday prefer lower prices whenever possible. If I had to choose between the Watch 7 44mm for $247 or the Watch 6 44mm for $159, I'd lean towards the last-gen model.</p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> in its smaller size, I'd recommend paying a little extra for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C7929YMK"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6 44mm at $159.99 (52% off)</strong></a>, another all-time low! The display jump from 1.3- to 1.5-inches makes a huge visual difference without weighing much more, and while the 40mm only has Black models left, the 44mm is available in both Black and Silver, giving you more options.</p><p>Out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a>, the Galaxy Watch 6 is still on my list, despite the Watch 7 supplanting it, because of its longevity: It just received Wear OS 5 and will get three more system updates by 2027. Unlike other old, cheap watches, the Watch 6 will keep getting new Galaxy AI tricks and app smarts for <em>years</em>.</p><p>I'll admit that I'd miss the Watch 7's dual-band GPS tracking, but that's only because I'm a regular runner who's greedy for the most accurate stats possible. "Normal" people can happily make do with the Galaxy Watch 6, which still has all the Samsung Health tricks and third-party Wear OS apps like Strava that you need to train and get (or stay) healthy!</p><p>While I personally love my Pixel Watch 3 as a Wear OS alternative, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D91268TH"><strong>early Black Friday deal of $329 ($70 off)</strong></a> isn't nearly as impressive. Only the Galaxy Watch 6 and 7 deals are especially kind to your wallet, and the Watch 6 in particular isn't likely to last very long! You can be patient on the newer watches, but this watch might very well sell out for good while you wait for something better.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a comfortable, light pair of headphones; you value versatility with iOS and Android fast-pairing, plus a 3.5mm jack; you want premium features like Spatial and Lossless Audio, ANC, and transparency mode.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the absolute best sound quality; you don't like the plastic construction of the Beats Studio Pro.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about the Beats Studio Pro is that the headphones share a lot of similarities with the AirPods Max, which retail for $549.99. I've tested both extensively, and I won't lie to you — the AirPods Max do sound better, and have better ANC. When I think about <em>how much</em> better the AirPods Max sound than the Beats Studio Pro, that's when things start to change. I don't think the AirPods Max are $400 better than the Beats Studio Pro, and that's roughly the price difference between these two headphones when you consider the $159.99 deal price of the Studio Pro.</p><p>So, with the Beats Studio Pro, you're getting about 90% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-airpods-max-work-android-phones">AirPods Max</a> experience at a fraction of the price. The Beats Studio Pro still have a custom Beats chip facilitating quick, snappy connection with both iOS and Android. There's also solid active noise-canceling, transparency mode, and support for Dolby Atmos, Lossless Audio, and Spatial Audio. Plus, you get a 3.5mm jack for when you want to use a cable.</p><p>Now, the Beats Studio Pro aren't the only pair of Beats headphones on sale. Budget buyers will probably want to grab the Solo 4 instead, which are half off for a limited time, bringing the price down to $99.99. Target lists the deal as ending tomorrow, so you'll want to act fast to secure this discount.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a basic, cheap pair of wireless on-ear headphones; you want a pair of headphones that'll stay secure on your head during workouts; you need fast-pairing with iOS and Android; you want a 3.5mm jack.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need ANC and transparency mode; you find on-ear headphones uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The Beats Solo 4 aren't perfect, but it's easy to accept a compromise or two when the headphones are available for just under $100. There's no ANC or transparency mode support, which is a big bummer. But they have solid sound, long battery life, and a reliable connection with iOS and Android quick pairing. Strong clamping force helps the Beats Solo 4 become my top recommendation for on-ear workout headphones. These won't fall off while you're lifting weights or going for a run.</p><p>Black Friday hasn't even officially started yet, and Beats already has a discount for everyone. Not looking to spend a lot on a new pair of headphones? Pick up the Beats Solo 4. Want a premium experience at a midrange price? There's the Beats Studio Pro.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp has announced a new Voice Message Transcripts feature for select languages.</li><li>The aim is to help users with transcripts when they cannot hear the received voice notes in select situations.</li><li>WhatsApp also notes that it can help comprehend longer voice notes more easily.</li><li>The global rollout in select languages is to happen in the coming weeks, with the promise of adding more languages soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you are a WhatsApp user, chances are you already know how voice notes work on the messaging platform. It is a handy functionality for sharing quick voice messages instead of typing long texts, and it is now getting a nifty new expansion.</p><p>WhatsApp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-voice-message-transcripts">has announced</a> that it is introducing voice message transcripts for users who often send voice notes to their friends and family. The Meta-owned company notes that although the voice message itself adds a personal touch compared to a regular text message, in certain scenarios, like when in a loud place or at a concert, it can be difficult to hear a voice message.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nzGKSzJZVLxHZdmKzEzscj" name="whatspp-voice-message-transcripts-02" alt="WhatsApp Voice Message Transcripts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzGKSzJZVLxHZdmKzEzscj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In such cases, these newly introduced voice message transcripts aim to save time. Additionally, having transcripts of longer voice notes will be handy for comprehending or getting back to them later. WhatsApp is also adding its privacy aspect to the transcripts, as they are generated on your device so that no one, including WhatsApp, can “hear or read your personal messages.”</p><p>The transcripts feature is also optional and can be manually enabled or turned off entirely. The messaging platform users can head to <strong>WhatsApp Settings> Chats> Voice message transcripts</strong> to enable or disable the feature in their preferred language. Once the feature is enabled, users can long-press the voice message and tap on “transcribe,” and the transcript can be viewed instantly.</p>

<p>The latest addition is believed to be rolling out globally in the coming weeks, with select languages for the start, and more languages are likely to be added in the coming months. WhatsApp has provided a little <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/241617298315321/?cms_platform=android">how-to guide</a> and has listed the languages currently supported by the new transcripts feature. They include English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian.</p><p>Meanwhile, WhatsApp has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-whatsapp-message-drafts-rollout">introduced</a> other nifty features to keep up with the competition. These include the ability to have messages in drafts, which can be sent later to chats, just like email.</p><p>Some WhatsApp users are also seeing new typing indicators from the recipients within the chat. The rollout appears to be on the server side. It appears to be an expansion of what users are already accustomed to. Previously, users could see a Typing indicator right under the contact name.</p>

<ul><li>A report states the EU could have Amazon in its sights in 2025 for a potential investigation into its marketplace practices.</li><li>The EU may look into whether or not Amazon is guilty of not pushing its products and the competition's equally.</li><li>Amazon could face a fine worth up to 10% of its "global annual turnover."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon might find itself in the hot seat again in the EU over a reported "breach in tech rules."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-likely-face-investigation-under-eu-tech-rules-next-year-sources-say-2024-11-21/">Reuters</a>, the EU might seek out Amazon to investigate an apparent DMA ruleset breach in 2025. What the EU is reportedly looking to learn is whether Amazon has pushed its own products to consumers more than the competition's.</p><p>Murmurings about a potential investigation started in March, per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/eu-investigate-apple-google-meta-potential-digital-markets-act-breaches-2024-03-25/">previous Reuters report</a>. Back then, it was stated that the EU could look into the "ranking practices" Amazon conducts on its marketplace and whether that falls outside of the boundaries set forth by the EU.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson said in March that the company has remained "compliant" with the set rules. The report states that Amazon "does not differentiate" between its products and those sold by third parties.</p><p>Now, the publication cites those close to the matter in saying that Amazon could face a fine worth up to 10% of its "global annual turnover."</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Amazon about this potential investigation. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>In September 2023, the European Commission named its first six "gatekeepers" under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-apple-imessage-gatekeeper-ruling">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>. Additionally, 22 services were deemed fit to fall under the "Core Platform" umbrella. In short, the DMA is the EU's ruleset for major companies to ensure that healthy competition lives on. One company shouldn't give itself an unfair advantage over another that's trying to make good on its platform.</p><p>Amazon's Marketplace fell within the EU's "intermediation" box for the DMA. As Reuters also reiterated, this was designed to ensure Amazon — like many others — couldn't promote themselves above others in the name of profit.</p><p>This also isn't the first time Amazon has fallen in the hot seat with the EU or even the FTC, for that matter. The company was forced to provide a clear process for consumers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-prime-updated-cancellation-process-europe">cancel its Prime membership</a> in the EU. The old process was dubbed "manipulative" as consumers found it difficult to navigate the process, thus incurring another monthly charge. After complying, Amazon rolled out a simpler, two-step process to exit the membership.</p><p>A similar investigation took place in the U.S. in 2023 as the FTC said Amazon conducted "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-sues-amazon-unfair-prime-charges">dark digital practices</a>."</p>

<ul><li>A Google app beta discovery suggests Gemini Live could grab an "Ask about this video" feature for YouTube.</li><li>Findings suggest this will let users hold a conversation, with follow-up questions, about the currently playing YouTube video.</li><li>YouTube detailed a test of its own "conversational AI" in its mobile app that would let users "Ask" about the video.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent beta suggests Google is working on a more conversational experience with Gemini during your downtime.</p><p>Strings of code in the v15.46.31.ve.arm64 of the Google app's beta tease a new experience between Gemini Live and YouTube. Discovered by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-conversation-mode-3500632/">Android Authority</a>), Google might roll out a "conversation mode" for the AI model when watching videos. A line of code directly mentions this feature's teamwork with YouTube; however, there's more to it.</p><p>The tipster was able to produce a small portion of the feature in the beta, showcasing what users might see. The provided image shows that producing Gemini's overlay may soon feature an "Ask about this video" chip. Speculation suggests this will open users up to an ongoing conversation with Gemini about the video's contents.</p><p>Users can reportedly ask about what's in the video with the opportunity to offer follow-up questions, too.</p><p>It's unclear if users can verbally say their query or if typing is the only way forward. Despite little else discoverable, another line of code encourages users to raise their device's volume "to hear Gemini."</p>

<p>While this feature seems like a likely next step after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, Gemini Live's alleged feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-highlights-premium-features-coversational-ai">looks like YouTube's</a>. A year ago, YouTube started an AI experiment with Premium users that let them playtest a conversational experience. That test included two features: AI-powered summaries for comments and a new "Ask" button for videos.</p><p>The latter was featured with a Gemini-esque star beside the Share and Like buttons under a video. Upon interaction, testers were greeted with three query suggestions: "Summarize this video," "Tell me more about this topic," and "Recommend related content."</p><p>While it <em>seems </em>like Gemini Live will lack the summarization portion, it will at least let users query about piqued their interest. Moreover, users could continue to "Ask" YouTube about the video they were watching, which is (kind of) like putting forth a follow-up question.</p><p>Aside from its official dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-on-iphone-dedicated-app-launch">app launch on iOS</a>, Gemini Live was rumored to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-could-soon-start-messing-around-with-your-files">file management capabilities</a> through Google Drive.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;re prepared to sign up or upgrade to a new wireless plan; you have an old or broken device to trade in. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re happy with your current wireless carrier; you can&apos;t afford Verizon&apos;s Unlimited Ultimate plan.</p><p>Indeed, Unlimited Ultimate is Verizon&apos;s most expensive plan, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. I&apos;m talking about 5G Ultra Wideband, 60GB of mobile hotspot data every month, and unlimited talk, text, and data in over 210 countries worldwide. The plan starts at $90 per month per line, but you can drop that down considerably by adding multiple lines at once. </p><p>Verizon is also being pretty generous with the trade-in devices it accepts for this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday deal</a>. I was surprised to see that my old Galaxy S20 FE earned me the full amount, which means I&apos;m eligible to get the $1,500 worth of devices when I add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan. </p><p>For sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> like this aren&apos;t for everyone, but if you can make it work for you, it&apos;s quite the holiday miracle! </p>

<hr>
<p>It feels like this dance won't end. Samsung is rumored to have delayed its major OS upgrade beta once again.</p><p>The latest flurry of rumors from X by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/FamilyTaes/status/1859542091161845932">FamilyTaes</a> claims Samsung has pushed its One UI 7 beta (Android 15) back several more weeks (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/22/samsung-android-15-beta-delay-timeline-leak/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster states the company's first beta for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a> is now set to begin in the "first week" of December. The beta is suspected to run for ~2 months with a full rollout potentially occurring in February.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster states the Galaxy S23 series could enter the beta anywhere from two to three weeks from now.</p><p>There's uncertainty around when the Galaxy S22 series could see it and the tipster completely dashed any beta hopes for the S21.</p><p>According to the tipster, the reason for this (grueling) delay is problems within the code. They cite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/FamilyTaes/status/1859874334304854054">Ice Universe from Weibo</a>, who stated Samsung encountered bugs that needed to be handled.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many anticipated the One UI 7 Beta to launch this week, but those hopes have been dashed.The latest updates suggest an early December release, with US and Korea likely being the first countries to receive it, followed by Germany and others. Let’s wait and see how it unfolds! pic.twitter.com/advN98VaHV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1859946752297910272">November 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>What's more, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1859946752297910272">Max Jambor</a> posted on X and, in a way, doubled down on what's been going around. They state that while the beta was anticipated to arrive this week (the week of November 22), recent updates suggest otherwise. Jambor reiterates that Samsung could drop the One UI 7 beta "early" in December.</p><p>The post adds that users in the U.S. and Korea should be the first ones into the Beta Program. Users in Germany "and others" may grab it shortly after.</p><p>Calling Samsung's first One UI 7 beta rocky would be an understatement. The Beta Program was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-first-beta-to-hit-galaxy-devices-after-november-17-in-us">initially expected</a> to start in mid-to-late November. Tipsters claimed the beta would've dropped for eager testers during the week of November 17; however, that hasn't happened. What has remained consistent are the devices we may expect.</p><p>Similar to now, the Galaxy S24 and the S23 are rumored to be among the first two series to receive the One UI 7 (Android 15) beta. There's a lot we're expecting from this beta after Samsung showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">a quick demo of it</a> during SDC 2024. The company plans to completely overhaul its UI, which could see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-fluid-animations-leak">smoother animations</a> and more.</p><p>Elsewhere, One UI 7 might use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">Apple's Intelligence as inspiration</a> for an alleged "AI-driven notification summary feature."</p>

Compare that price with your last phone bill or device payment and tell me that that doesn't sound pretty sweet. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're interested in buying one of the best flagship phones of 2024; you're looking to switch to one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">the best MVNO carriers</a>; you live in an area with great T-Mobile coverage. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer to buy phones unlocked; you don't want to be locked into one wireless plan for a year; you're a particularly heavy data user. </p><p>Of course, if you're happy with your current wireless carrier or you simply prefer to buy your phones unlocked, then by all means check out the awesome deals being touted by other retailers. But if you're okay with switching wireless carriers today, signing up for this Mint deal is one of the most cost-effective ways to do so.</p><p>Owned an operated by T-Mobile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a> operates by selling wireless in three, six, and 12-month chunks of time. The Unlimited plan gives you endless talk, text, and 5G data (capped at 40GB before speeds slow), plus a free mobile hotspot and talk and text in Mexico/Canada. T-Mobile operates the biggest 5G network in the United States, so coverage is rarely an issue, and there's something really nice about paying for everything upfront. Once you place your order, you won't need to think about your phone bill for another year, AND you'll be getting an awesome Android phone out of the deal. If that's not a great Black Friday promotion, I don't know what is.</p>
