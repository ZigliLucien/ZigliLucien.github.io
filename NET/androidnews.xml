                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ll preface this by saying I like using Pixels; I switch between several dozen phones a year, but when I&apos;m done with all the reviews and need a daily driver, I inevitably pick up a Pixel. The decision comes down to two things: clean software and consistent cameras. While most Android skins have decent interfaces these days, there&apos;s still a lot of overt styling, and I prefer what Google does in this area with Material You.</p><p>And while Google doesn&apos;t have the outright lead in cameras these days — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> take better photos and videos — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> takes the most consistent photos, and it does a great job with portrait shots and moving objects.</p>

<p>That said, Google&apos;s phones aren&apos;t without issues. I&apos;ve had a litany of problems with Pixels over the years; the panel on the Pixel 2 XL had washed-out colors, it didn&apos;t take much to break the Pixel 3 XL (I did it twice in two months), the oleophobic coat on my Pixel 4 XL wore out in under three months of use, and the volume rocker on the Pixel 7 Pro detached randomly one day. Last year, the Pixel 8 Pro decided to charge sporadically, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-already-doubting-the-long-term-durability-of-my-pixel-8-pro">USB-C port was to blame</a> — this was an issue on the Pixel 6 Pro as well.</p><p>Look, most phones have some issue or the other, but the percentage of hardware-related problems I&apos;ve had with Pixels is significantly higher than any other brand. With Google now guaranteeing seven years of updates, it needs to do better in this area, and if the messaging around better durability is any indication, it looks like the brand is taking this seriously.</p><p>While that&apos;s undoubtedly good, Google for some reason just can&apos;t seem to nail the basics. Some of this is down to the choice of hardware; Google used Samsung&apos;s Exynos 2400 as the foundation for the Tensor G4, and other than newer cores, it is nearly indistinguishable to the Tensor G3.</p><p>Google made it clear that it doesn&apos;t want to chase performance numbers, and the brand instead chooses to focus on the TPU that powers all the AI features on its devices. That&apos;s fine by me; I don&apos;t use the Pixel 8 Pro because it is the fastest, but because it has a good overall experience. But what&apos;s annoying is that Google doesn&apos;t do any meaningful thermal management — even on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> generation — and that makes these devices prone to throttling and overheating.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV" name="google-pixel-9-with-buds-pro-2-peony-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Peony pink Google Pixel 9 next to the pink Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the arbitrary feature gating; most global models of the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL include a Wi-Fi 7 modem, but the phones sold in India use an older Wi-Fi 6 modem. All other flagships sold in the country have Wi-Fi 7 as standard, but Google decided to not bother.</p><p>Even on the global version, Google randomly decided to not include features like 8K video and Night Sight video on the standard model, limiting these to the Pro variants. In a similar vein, the base models still come with 128GB of storage, and that&apos;s ridiculous in 2024; even mid-range phones now start at 256GB, and at this point, Google is just nickel-and-diming customers in this regard.</p><p>Hilariously, the base models of the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro XL have an unnecessary 16GB of RAM and woefully inadequate 128GB of storage, and there isn&apos;t another brand that offers this configuration. It&apos;s clear that Google is trying to emulate Apple, and is using a similar pricing strategy to upsell storage variants.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="scfUdVxyWnHitQpX3n7tQh" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-06-display.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scfUdVxyWnHitQpX3n7tQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s also the question of pricing; the Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 and the 9 Pro XL at $1,099, and that&apos;s for phones with 128GB of storage; you&apos;ll need to pay another $100 to get 256GB models of these devices, and Google doesn&apos;t have anywhere as generous trade-in offers as Samsung.</p><p>Granted, these are minor irritants, but they matter on a flagship. There really isn&apos;t much to distinguish most flagships these days — at least on the hardware front — so every misstep is amplified. Google says its devices are the best at AI — and they are — and so it&apos;s asking a premium. Again, that&apos;s justified; ultimately, it&apos;s down to the brand to dictate what its phones cost.</p><p>But Google needs to understand that if it wants to price its phones in line with Apple and Samsung, it needs to deliver equivalent features; I&apos;m just not sure it is doing that.</p>

<ul><li>Google has launched the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL in India.</li><li>Thankfully, all three models are available in a single variant with 256GB of storage.</li><li>The Pixel 9 and 9 Pro don't cost that much more than their predecessors.</li><li>Google also introduced the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in the country, and that will set you back ₹1,72,999 ($2,061).</li></ul>
<p>Google unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 generation</a> earlier than usual this year, and the brand also showcased the awkwardly-named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. There are a lot of differences this time around, and I&apos;m not just talking about the accelerated launch — the Pixels have a new design language with flat sides that makes them look like an iPhone, and there are three models: the standard Pixel 9, a Pixel 9 Pro that has the same dimensions as the regular model but with a telephoto lens at the back, and a Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>If you&apos;ve used a Pro model in the Pixel series in the past, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is what you&apos;ll need to get. With the foldable, that makes four new devices. Outside of the differences with the design, Google is changing how it&apos;s selling phones in India; it just started assembling the Pixel 8 series locally, and it may do the same with the Pixel 9.</p><p>As a result, there isn&apos;t a noticeable increase in pricing from last year. The Pixel 9 is sold in a 12GB/256GB model and is available for ₹79,999 ($953), and that&apos;s actually less than the equivalent Pixel 8, which debuted at ₹82,999 ($989). The Pixel 9 Pro costs ₹1,09,999 ($1,310) for the 12GB/256GB model, and while it is marginally more than the ₹1,06,999 ($1,275) asking price of the Pixel 8 Pro last year, that phone was only sold in a 128GB model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-rose-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL, meanwhile, debuts at ₹1,24,999 ($1,489) for the 16GB/256GB model, and that&apos;s on par with what the Galaxy S24 Ultra costs in the country. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold, meanwhile, is available at ₹1,72,999 ($2,061), making it the costliest foldable in the country — the Galaxy Z Fold 6 retails for ₹1,64,999 ($1,966).</p><p>What I like about Google&apos;s positioning is that all models come with 256GB of storage as standard. However, there are no other variants available, and if you want more storage, there isn&apos;t an alternative. I don&apos;t understand why Google does this year after year — surely, it isn&apos;t too hard to have all colors and storage variants of a phone available.</p><p>Anyway, if you&apos;re interested in a new Pixel, you should just get the Pixel 8 series; the standard Pixel 8 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/google-pixel-8-hazel-128-gb/p/itm67e2a2531aaac?pid=MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ">currently discounted to ₹58,999 ($703)</a>, and that is a good value considering what&apos;s on offer. While I think the Pixel 9 is decent in its own right, it isn&apos;t worth an additional ₹21,000.</p><p>Pixels never sold well in India in the past, and I don&apos;t see that changing with the Pixel 9 generation. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is unlikely to find any takers; foldables are still a niche, and while Chinese manufacturers are making inroads in this category, I can&apos;t see anyone shelling out more than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to pick up what Google is offering.</p>

<p>Google hammers away at more AI software for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>; however, there&apos;s more in store for its convenient search feature.</p><p>We&apos;ve been expecting Circle to Search to pick up audio lookup for a while, and a demo by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-audio-search-first-look-3470398/">Android Authority</a> takes it for a spin. An APK dive into the latest beta version (15.32.36) of the Google app shows how this feature, "Audio Search," might work in a stable release.</p><p>From <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/uerc9sZJjTA">the demo</a>, producing Circle to Search will display a new music note beside the search text box. Tapping it will overlay a graphic on top of your current display. If you&apos;ve hit play on Spotify or another listening service, Circle to Search will use that for your query.</p><p>The software will listen in for a few seconds before switching your display to the Google app&apos;s search results. The song&apos;s title will pop into the text field at the top, as well.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the latest beta builds upon previous suspicions by showing the company&apos;s plans to let users "sing or hum" a song on this screen. This is similar to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-search-for-a-song-on-youtube-by-singing-or-humming">Search a Song</a>" in the Google app or YouTube Music, accessible by hitting the microphone icon or Search in the latter app. Users can play, hum, or sing a song for music-based queries.</p><p>The publication states that Google may display a quick bubble when opening Circle to Search <em>after </em>this feature arrives for informative reasons.</p>

<p>It was first speculated that Google was developing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/circle-to-search-audio-lookup-spotted">an audio lookup feature</a> for Circle to Search in June. Back then, the feature was awfully barebones, only offering a quick glimpse at the music note icon that would signify its availability. Moreover, it still doesn&apos;t seem as though Google will let users attach a text-based add-on to their query <em>before </em>the software runs its search.</p><p>The demo suggests users can alter the lookup afterward, which might have to do. Despite the feature advancing between beta versions, there&apos;s no telling when users could see this rollout.</p><p>In other news, there&apos;s a chance Google will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">bring split-screen support</a> to its search function. Shortly after Android 15 Beta 1.2, it was discovered that Pixel phones could be in line for this QoL (quality of life) addition. Samsung devices don&apos;t suffer from this lack of support, which could indicate a simple lapse during software development on Google&apos;s side.</p>

This year, Google had quite a bit of hardware to show off, including a total of four smartphones, as well as a new smartwatch and some earbuds. And, of course, it&apos;s not a Google event without a few hundred mentions of AI or Gemini.</p><p>Hopefully, you&apos;ve been following our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-event-2024-live-blog-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-3-gemini-and-everything-else-we-expect-to-see">Made by Google 2024 live blog</a> so you don&apos;t miss out on all the fun, but here&apos;s a quick roundup of everything that was announced.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-9-9-pro-and-9-pro-xl-2">Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, Google launched not one, not two, but three mainline Pixel 9 phones. The best part is that you can get a larger Pixel 9 Pro XL and a smaller Pixel 9 Pro, which matches the size of the regular Pixel 9. This way, you have a choice of size for your next Pro device.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> has some fun colors and a new design language that could be seen as an evolution of the Pixel style we&apos;ve seen in recent years. The display, frame, and back panel are completely flat, while the new floating camera visor mostly retains the iconic Pixel design cues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-rose-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Underneath, the phones are powered by the Tensor G4 chipset, which boosts AI performance and more. The base model has 12GB of RAM, while the Pro phones have 16GB of RAM, more than enough to juggle apps and handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> processing.</p><p>The cameras also received some upgrades, with a new ultrawide sensor for better low-light capture and improved selfie cameras. There are also tons of new AI camera features for users to take advantage of, such as Add Me, which lets users add themselves to photos, and upgrades to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, which can enable 8K video on the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">preorder the Pixel 9 series now</a>, starting at $799.

<h2 id="pixel-9-pro-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-obsidian-porcelain-side-by-side-angle-closer.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Porcelain and Obsidian face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of a Pixel Fold 2, Google unveiled a rather different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Evolving from the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">original foldable</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold adopts a similar design language to the Pixel 9 series, sporting a thin, flat chassis. The camera housing has changed from a bar to a more rectangular shape, and the device comes in only two colors.</p><p>The external screen is the same 6.3 inches as the Pixel 9 Pro, while the internal display is now a large 8-inch panel, bringing a more expansive view of content and apps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-prompt-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, unlike the last model, which ran a slightly outdated chipset, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes with the same Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, making it quite a powerful phone.</p><p>You&apos;ll get all the same AI features as the Pixel 9 series, although the camera specs aren&apos;t as robust. The primary camera is a 48MP sensor, while the other cameras come with 10MP resolutions. Still, you should be able to take some great photos thanks to Google&apos;s phenomenal computational photography.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-preorder-deals">preorder the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> with a starting price of $1799 and two available color options. The phone should ship in September.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-watch-3-2">Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-fitbit-quick-start.jpg" alt="Fitbit Quick Start buttons on Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5111" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The third iteration of Google&apos;s Pixel Watch may look exactly like its predecessors, but there are some notable changes and upgrades. Even though it has the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> now comes in two different sizes: 41mm and 45mm. The bezels around the displays are also smaller, meaning you get a more immersive smartwatch experience and more room to play with apps and such.</p><p>Google has also included plenty of new fitness features aimed at runners, allowing users to create their own custom running routines and follow guides to warm up or cool down. Fitbit also now has new readiness and cardio load scores to help you prepare for the day and learn how hard you&apos;re pushing yourself during workouts.</p>

<p>Years after Google&apos;s first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a> hit the market, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> land with a new Tensor A1 chip. This promises to bring enhanced audio quality, better ANC, and long battery life. There are also features like Clear Calling and Automatic Conversation Detection, which reduce background noise in calls and pause music when you&apos;re talking.</p><p>The Buds Pro 2 have exceptional battery life, with 12 hours per charge without ANC and 8 hours with it on. The earbuds also support Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> network, so you can locate them easily.</p><p>These are also the first earbuds to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> support, so you can access the AI assistant from your buds without needing to remove or unlock your phone.</p><p>You can preorder the Pixel Buds Pro 2 now for $299.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-and-other-ai-features-2">Gemini and other AI features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-01.jpg" alt="Talking to Gemini Live on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini is getting plenty of upgrades. Google provided a new demo of Gemini Live, a conversational assistant coming to Pixel phones. The assistant allows users to have more natural-sounding conversations, which can help them come up with new ideas. The demo was pretty impressive, and Gemini Live is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">going live on Pixel 9 devices</a> starting today, August 13, for users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a>.</p><p>Gemini can also be used to identify anything on your Pixel&apos;s screen.</p>

<p>In addition to Gemini, Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio also bring new helpful and impressive AI capabilities. The former stores your screenshots and analyzes the information on device so that you can recall things later. The latter allows you to type prompts to create images, and it&apos;s even good at generating legible text on these images.</p><p>The new Call Notes feature will record and transcribe/summarize your calls. It can also help you recall information made in a call in case you forget.</p><p>These are just some of the new features Google showcased during the event, which also included a host of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-new-accessibility-update-helps-you-search-your-surroundings-faster-than-ever">upgraded accessibility features</a>.</p>

<p>Since the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro both have the same screen size, both phones use the same screen protectors without any alignment issues. In fact, they also use the same phone covers, making it easier for users to shop for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro cases</a>.</p><p>Coming back to screen protectors, there are two main pathways to consider, and a third lesser-known option. Most folks usually opt for tempered glass screen protectors on account of their famous durability and shatter-proof nature. Those who don&apos;t like the thickness of glass choose the alternative, which is TPU or PET plastic films. Then there&apos;s the hybrid "glass-tick" films that try to blend the two. These are a hit or a miss, depending on the brand and make.</p><p>For most kinds of users, a tempered glass screen protector is ideal. In this category, the OMOTON 3+2 Pack Screen Protector for Google Pixel 9 Pro 6.3-inch is the best overall pick. You can use this 6.3-inch screen guard with your Pixel 9 or 9 Pro as with all Pixel 9 or 9 Pro screen protectors. This set gives you explosive bang for your buck, including three tempered glass screen protectors and two tempered glass camera unit protectors in the box. The kit is super affordable and the brand is very well-reviewed, so it&apos;s a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Choosing what color Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 to buy isn&apos;t as tough of a decision next to a smartwatch or a phone. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>, the carrying cases are all the same anyway, so you&apos;re only really looking at the buds themselves.</p><p>As I always say, pick the color that strikes your fancy. Don&apos;t think about anyone else&apos;s opinion because it&apos;s your money and you get to choose what you like. But if you&apos;re not taken by any of the colorways right off the bat, you could just be practical about the matter.</p><p>Porcelain is too light and likely to get dirty very soon and more frequently. Hazel won&apos;t have this issue since it&apos;s almost black. If you want to be able to find your buds from far away, get bright colors like Peony or Wintergreen. You can spot the hot pink Pixel Buds Pro 2 from a mile away, so you&apos;re less likely to loose them.</p><p>And of course, if you&apos;ve already got a smartwatch, match your Pixel Buds Pro 2 to the color of your wearable. Even if you don&apos;t have a Pixel Watch, just look at the color palette and theme of your gear and pick a shade that goes with it.</p>

You can grab the Wi-Fi or LTE variant of the Pixel Watch 3 in either 41mm or 45mm case sizes. There are three case colors for each size, but they are not the same, with two shared colors and one shade being exclusive to each size.</p><p>Each <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> comes with a fluoroelastomer Active Band out of the box. If you opt for the classic 41mm case size, you can choose from one of four watch strap shades. However, the larger 45mm Pixel Watch 3 only comes with three Active Band colorways. Don&apos;t worry about figuring out what colors are exclusive to which size, because we&apos;ve jotted everything down for you right here.</p>

<h2 id="before-choosing-the-color-decide-what-size-google-pixel-watch-3-you-want-2">Before choosing the color, decide what size Google Pixel Watch 3 you want</h2>
<p>Before diving into the colors of the Pixel Watch 3, you need to decide what size you are going to buy. This depends on your wrist size. If you found the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 to be too small, the answer is simple: get the larger 45mm variant. However, if you have smaller wrists, the 41mm case size is going to be a perfect fit.</p><p>The second most important piece of information is backward compatibility. That&apos;s right, just like you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-you-use-pixel-watch-bands-on-the-google-pixel-watch-2">use the Pixel Watch bands on the Pixel Watch 2</a>, you can also use both the last-gen Google Pixel Watch bands on your Pixel Watch 3. So if you&apos;re trading in an older model and have extra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-bands">Watch bands</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-bands">Watch 2 bands</a> lying around, hold on to them. They will definitely fit the 41mm variant of the Pixel Watch 3. Unfortunately, the 45mm Watch 3 will require new bands altogether as the older ones are too small for it.</p><p>With that out of the way, you can finally start thinking about what color Pixel Watch 3 you should buy. For the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, the Polished Silver Aluminum case / Rose Quartz Active Band is the best option because the silver case is highly versatile and the delightful rosy strap is unique to the 41mm variant. The 41mm Watch is compatible with all the old-gen bands that are much cheaper now, so you have a lot more choice.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 adds a Matte Hazel Aluminum case that&apos;s never been seen before to the Google wearable lineup. This grayish-green color is elegant and goes surprisingly well with a wide range of Pixel Watch bands. You won&apos;t be disappointed with this unusual case color.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google launched the Pixel Watch 3 today (August 13) and is detailing a new emergency feature: Loss of Pulse.</li><li>The device leans on its heart rate sensors and AI software to detect and confirm if a person's heartbeat and movement are non-existent.</li><li>The watch will automatically call emergency services with an audible message explaining the situation.</li><li>Google's Pixel Watch 3 will arrive late in September, starting at $349.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-event-2024-live-blog-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-3-gemini-and-everything-else-we-expect-to-see">Made by Google event</a> now concluded, the company revealed a crucial emergency feature on its watch for loss of pulse.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection/">Keyword post</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 features Google&apos;s first "Loss of Pulse" detection feature for unresponsive users. The post states that this feature relies on heart rate sensors and algorithms alongside AI software. If your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> does not detect your heart rate with its standard green light, it will activate its red-hued infrared sensors for an additional scan.</p><p>The watch&apos;s motion sensor will join soon after. Google states that it will initiate a check-in after the device confirms that your pulse and movement are absent. Users will see a "Checking for pulse..." display on their Watch 3. Beneath will be an "I&apos;m OK" button to deter it from automatically calling emergency services.</p><p>Afterward, the Pixel Watch 3 will call emergency services within 20 seconds with its automated message in tow to detail the situation.</p><p>If you&apos;ve purchased the LTE variant of the Watch 3, the device will handle all communications. However, the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi variant will lean on your phone to handle the call.</p>

<p>Google states that it leveraged user research to limit "false positives" during the device&apos;s monitoring. Moreover, the company has also worked with cardiologists to train its AI algorithm. This was put through the wringer as live tests were conducted. The Pixel Watch 3 was then strapped to stunt actors who simulated a loss of pulse using a tourniquet. That was paired with simulated falls, producing an impact strong enough to stop one&apos;s heart.</p><p>Loss of Pulse detection is an opt-in feature for all Pixel Watch 3 owners. Users in the U.K., France, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland are among the first to receive it this September. There&apos;s no word yet on U.S. availability, but Google states it will continue to work to gain the appropriate regulatory permissions for additional areas.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-series-goes-official">Pixel Watch 3 launched today</a> (August 13) during the Made by Google event and has two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Consumers can find the device in various colors and several band styles. Google improved its viewing experience by widening the display with 16% fewer bezels than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>Thanks to its deep Fitbit integration, this year&apos;s model offers a host of health and fitness features for runners, sports enthusiasts, and others.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3&apos;s Loss of Pulse detection should fit comfortably beside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-explains-fall-detection">Google&apos;s fall detection</a> software. The watch&apos;s motion sensors carry the bulk of weight, sensing any "hard fall" before leaning on its software to check in on a person. Similar to Loss of Pulse, the company trained its algorithms on stunt doubles who threw themselves (repeatedly) so it could understand a true, life-threatening fall.</p><p>Fall detection is an opt-in feature, but it&apos;s relatively easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-enable-fall-detection-pixel-watch">navigate the settings to enable it</a>. The Pixel Watch 3 arrives in late September, bringing Loss of Pulse with it.</p>

<p>There&apos;s no denying just how different this year&apos;s Pixels look, yet they still retain some of that unique Pixel flavor by keeping the centered camera visor on the back. There&apos;s also no denying the iPhone&apos;s influence on these phones with the flat sides and flat glass all around, though.</p><p>If you love flat phones that look a whole lot like an iPhone, this is about as good as it gets. If that&apos;s not your thing, though, maybe a Pixel 9 case or Pixel 9 Pro XL case will help. After all, most phones only truly look different from the back, anyway.</p><p>At the very least, Google says this new design is twice as durable as previous Pixels, which is a good thing given some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-volume-rocker-falling-off">quality control issues</a> we&apos;ve seen in the past.</p>

<p>Compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 9 series feels a bit sterile and industrial. There&apos;s no denying how fun some of the new colors are, though — especially Wintergreen, Peony, and Rose Quartz — and the shiny side rails on the Pro models give it that extra premium look and feel.</p><p>But there are some pretty exciting hardware improvements to consider. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2</a> is nowhere to be seen, satellite SOS is making an appearance for the first time on a U.S. phone, and the quirky temperature sensor is now on both Pro models regardless of the size.</p><p>Plus, all Pixel 9 models <em>finally</em> charge faster this year! With the new 45W Pixel charger, you&apos;ll go from 0-50% in 30 minutes on a Pixel 9 or Pixel 9 Pro, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL will jump up to an impressive 70% in 30 minutes. That&apos;s not as fast as my favorite phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, but it&apos;s still a monumental improvement over anything Samsung offers and better than past Pixels.</p>

<p>A lot of the things Google is doing with new Pixel 9 features heavily rely on the Tensor G4 processor inside. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">As rumors hinted at</a>, the Tensor G4 isn&apos;t a big upgrade in the traditional sense. Gamers likely won&apos;t notice any real differences, and we&apos;re not yet sure if Google has improved the overheating situation of past Tensor processors until we get to test them longer.</p><p>So, while you&apos;re not getting much in the way of daily performance upgrades, all of Google&apos;s new apps and features revolve around the processor&apos;s considerable AI-processing muscle. The Tensor G4 is able to process AI-based tasks 2.25x faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor inside every other major Android flagship in 2024. That&apos;s a pretty unbelievable number.</p>

<p>To translate that into real-world usage, that means images you edit, the stickers you create, the emojis Gemini crafts, the calls recorded and transcribed, the screenshots searched and cataloged, and the friends added to photos stay private and on-device despite featuring the detail and speed of something processed in the cloud.</p><p>There&apos;s no denying just how fascinating <em>and</em> useful Google&apos;s new AI features are, especially when compared to some of the things Samsung launched alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> on its phones this year.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re set on upgrading to a Google Pixel 9 this year, you&apos;ll be able to choose from four different models for the first time ever. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is the largest, most expensive model available. It&apos;s best for folks who want a tablet and a phone all in one device.</p><p>Down from that is the Pixel 9 Pro XL which is roughly the same size as the Pixel 8 Pro. It features a 6.8-inch display and three cameras on the back, including a 48MP telephoto camera with a 5x optical zoom lens. It&apos;s also the fastest charging of the bunch, as I covered above.</p><p>But if you don&apos;t like large phones, never fear, for the Pixel 9 Pro is here! It sports the same 16GB of RAM and triple rear camera system as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It even has the 42MP selfie camera from that phone, although it won&apos;t charge quite as fast up to 100% as the Pro XL model.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 is the same size as the Pixel 9 Pro — it even fits in the same cases — but it cuts out some features to debut at $200 cheaper.</p><p>First off, it doesn&apos;t include a telephoto camera on the back, and the selfie camera is reduced from 42MP to 10.5MP. There&apos;s no Ultra-Wideband chip inside so device tracker tiles <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">won&apos;t work as well</a> as they will on the Pro models. The regular Pixel 9 also doesn&apos;t have the cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-google-pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor">temperature sensor</a> that&apos;s on the back of both Pro models.</p><p>On the software side of things, most features are identical between all Pixel 9 models but the cheaper Pixel 9 is missing a few camera feature found on the Pro models. The Pixel 9 is missing Video Boost, Zoom Enhance (since there&apos;s no telephoto camera), Video Boost, Night Sight Video, and Super Res Zoom Video.</p><p>If you&apos;re good to go without all those features, the cheapest Pixel 9 model is a pretty great way to get the best of Google without the added cost.</p>
