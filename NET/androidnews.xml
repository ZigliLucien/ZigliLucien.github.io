<hr>
<p>The age of the "AI PC" is firmly underway, and both hardware and software companies are racing to integrate artificial intelligence into their computing devices. Microsoft and Qualcomm had a big moment with Snapdragon X and Copilot Plus announcements last week, and now Google has a handful of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">Chromebook Plus announcements</a> of its own. Just like laptops that support Copilot Plus, select Chromebook Plus models will gain new AI features throughout ChromeOS. </p><p>It only made sense that Google would eventually add AI features to ChromeOS since the company has already made Gemini a focus of Android and Google Workspace. In fact, some features that have already appeared on Pixel phones—such as Help Me Write, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">Generative AI Wallpaper</a>, Video Call Backgrounds, and Magic Editor in Google Photos—will now come to Chromebook Plus laptops. </p><p>Of course, ChromeOS users have been able to use Gemini through the web client for as long as it has been active. However, the AI chatbot hasn&apos;t been directly integrated into ChromeOS until now. After updating to ChromeOS 125, there will be a Gemini app right on the ChromeOS app shelf. For now, Gemini on ChromeOS is just using a progressive web app (PWA) to open the chatbot in a separate window. In the future, it&apos;s possible that Gemini could play a bigger role in ChromeOS or even succeed Google Assistant. </p><p>Some features are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">exclusive to Chromebook Plus devices</a>, and others will come to all Chromebook models. Google says that they&apos;ll be released "through an automatic update over the next week or so." Based on these descriptions, it&apos;s easy to see how Chromebook Plus devices could be a competitor to Copilot Plus laptops. But can Chromebook Plus <em>really </em>compete?</p>
<h2 id="how-chromebook-plus-compares-to-copilot-plus-2">How Chromebook Plus compares to Copilot Plus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-update-page-chromeos-120-beta.jpg" alt="ChromeOS 120 on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The general idea behind Chromebook Plus and Copilot Plus is the same, but the actual implementations of each are different. Chromebook Plus is a hardware class that is comprised of devices that meet a certain criteria of specifications. By comparison, Copilot Plus is a software suite of AI features that can only run on devices with select hardware. The differences between the meaning of Copilot Plus and Chromebook Plus might sound like technicalities, though they are distinct. For starters, there are Chromebook Plus devices already out in the wild, while laptops with Copilot Plus won&apos;t ship until next month. </p><p>Copilot Plus specifically unlocks AI features by requiring laptops—and likely desktops, eventually—to have a powerful neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU needs to support 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS) or more, and right now, only Snapdragon X systems-on-a-chip meet that requirement. It&apos;s important to note that Copilot Plus system requirements are tied to the NPU rather than a specific class of devices. Only Snapdragon X laptops are supported for now, but Copilot Plus will come to more platforms, devices, and form factors in the future. </p><p>Chromebook Plus is a class of devices, unlike Copilot Plus. In order for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> to use the Chromebook Plus branding, it needs to have an Intel Core i3 12th-gen or higher or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series or higher processor. From there, Chromebook Plus laptops need to have at least 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage. Surprisingly, there are also webcam and display requirements, with the webcam needing to be at least 1080p and the display needing to be at least Full HD IPS.</p><p>So, buying a Chromebook Plus device will give you a premium Chromebook and a few exclusive software features, with the possibility of more coming in the future. The Copilot Plus designation is more about support for a specific suite of AI features that run on-device. These differences are important to keep in mind when figuring out which is right for you. </p>
<h2 id="bundling-google-one-ai-premium-with-chromebooks-is-brilliant-2">Bundling Google One AI Premium with Chromebooks is brilliant</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="FYUtc3yNzGDbMb3vy4Wa5A" name="chromebook-ai-feature-release-hero.jpeg" alt="Overview of new Chromebook and ChromeOS features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYUtc3yNzGDbMb3vy4Wa5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1921" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Microsoft is clearly targeting on-device processing and advanced features with deep OS integration with Copilot Plus. By comparison, Chromebook Plus and its new AI features are much more cloud-focused. There&apos;s no better evidence of that than Google bundling a free year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> with Chromebook Plus purchases. Among other benefits, the One AI Premium plan includes access to Gemini Advanced and Gemini for Workspace.</p><p>A full year of One AI Premium will cost $240, and it&apos;s a great perk that comes with Chromebook Plus devices. It makes sense to be included with Chromebook Plus laptops since ChromeOS will now put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> at the forefront of the experience. ChromeOS also excels at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> workflows, and the Gemini for Workspace features like Help Me Write could be a big advantage there. </p><p>On the flip side, it&apos;s only a free year. If you get used to using One AI Premium, you&apos;ll need to pay out-of-pocket after that 12-month trial is over. Then again, you can get a Chromebook Plus laptop for as little as $349, so it&apos;s hard to complain too much. </p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-not-copilot-plus-but-it-doesn-apos-t-have-to-be-2">It&apos;s not Copilot Plus, but it doesn&apos;t have to be</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RA7a5hVxnEoXf4ApdhjP3Y" name="copilot-windows-11-wc.jpg" alt="Microsoft Copilot with Bing Chat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RA7a5hVxnEoXf4ApdhjP3Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The truth is, Chromebook Plus and Copilot Plus aren&apos;t truly competing. A Chromebook Plus device costs a fraction of the price of a Copilot Plus laptop. Additionally, Chromebook Plus uses a bunch of lightweight and cloud-supported AI features, while Copilot Plus uses powerful on-device processing to support advanced features like Recall. </p><p>A better comparison would be Gemini in ChromeOS vs Copilot in Windows. The addition of Gemini to ChromeOS and the advanced Google AI tools included in Chromebook Plus models will probably be all the AI that casual users need. Copilot Plus didn&apos;t exist before, so Microsoft is going to prove to users why they need the exclusive suite of features. All the Chromebook Plus-exclusive features are things users are already familiar with, like Magic Editor and Gemini.</p><p>Chromebook Plus devices won&apos;t come close to beating Copilot Plus devices in terms of on-device AI performance. However, they might provide just enough AI at just the right price to win over casual users. In fact, casual users were the target audience for Chromebooks all along.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Xiaomi&apos;s global success was built on the back of the Redmi Note series, and while earlier models in the series were an easy recommendation thanks to great hardware combined with an insane value, that is no longer the case. What was once the best-selling budget phone now moved up a segment into the mid-range category, and as I noted last year in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12 Pro+ review</a>, Xiaomi didn&apos;t really think its strategy through.</p><p>The Chinese manufacturer is nothing if not obstinate, and the Redmi Note 13 series continued in the same vein. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro+</a> in particular stood out for its gorgeous design — it is still one of the best-looking mid-range phones — but the auxiliary cameras weren&apos;t worth the hassle, it missed out on 4K60 video, and most egregiously, it ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> out of the box.</p><p>Other than a few design and hardware differences, the situation was unchanged with the Redmi Note 13 Pro, so I decided to use the phone a bit longer and share long-term testing notes instead. Xiaomi insisted that it would deliver the Android 14 update to the phone by the end of Q1, but it failed to do so; the update started going out at the end of April, and it counted toward three of the guaranteed platform updates.</p><p>The Redmi Note 13 Pro also misses out on the hardware side of things, and after using the sporadically throughout the course of 2024, I&apos;m still not convinced you should buy it — there are much better alternatives available.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi Note 13 alongside the rest of the models in the series at the end of Q4 2023 in its home market. The series made its global debut in India on January 4, 2024, and went on sale in the country shortly thereafter. You can now buy the phones in most global markets — including the U.K., Germany and France.</p><p>In India, the Redmi Note 13 Pro costs ₹24,999 ($300) for the 8GB/128GB verison, with the 8GB/256GB model retailing at ₹27,999 ($325), and the 12GB/256GB edition available at ₹28,999 ($350). It is sold in a single 8GB/256GB variant in the U.K., where it costs £299 ($381). Over in Germany, the 8GB/256GB model is €289 ($314), and there&apos;s a 12GB/512GB version that retails for €369 ($401).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6ennz9W9RcyBuaY8oQqXxV" name="redmi-note-13-pro-17.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ennz9W9RcyBuaY8oQqXxV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To Xiaomi&apos;s credit, the brand did a great job with the design of the Redmi Note 13 series, and the Redmi Note 13 Pro looks the part of a mid-range phone. The key difference next to the Pro+ model is that the Pro has flat sides, and Xiaomi says it was an intentional design choice; it wanted to offer a phone with flat sides as an alternative to those users who don&apos;t prefer curved screens.</p>

<p>There are bevels around the sides that make the device a smidgen more comfortable to hold and use, and coming in at 187g, it is distinctly on the lighter side. The frosted glass back doesn&apos;t pick up much in the way of smudges, and the pastel hue adds to the allure of the device. You get the same hue along the sides as well, and it makes the design stand out a bit more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e9b8JArFJtUDCTsjGuQFgU" name="redmi-note-13-pro-9.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e9b8JArFJtUDCTsjGuQFgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island has a multi-colored pattern, and it adds visual flair to the design. The individual modules are nestled within rings, and the overall effect is rather elegant. Continuing with the positives, you get a 3.5mm jack on the device, and it is great if you&apos;ve got IEMs and want to plug in without needing a dongle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QgnoHsk24smKFmGEH4zrGV" name="redmi-note-13-pro-16.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgnoHsk24smKFmGEH4zrGV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about the Redmi Note 13 Pro is the display; it uses the same 6.67-inch panel as the Pro+ variant, goes up to 1,800 nits in HDR content, and the only difference is that it isn&apos;t curved. The AMOLED panel has vibrant colors and good viewing angles, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in daily use. There&apos;s Gorilla Glass Victus as well, and the phone came away unscathed the few times it took a tumble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qJNwrKt2Sm7pdH7CFcwE9W" name="redmi-note-13-pro-18.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJNwrKt2Sm7pdH7CFcwE9W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I would have liked to see more powerful hardware on the device, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 is good at the basics. This is by no means a gaming phone — there are better choices available if that&apos;s a requirement — but the phone doesn&apos;t lag in mundane tasks, and there&apos;s not much in the way of overheating.</p>

<p>The rest of the hardware is similarly decent, with the phone offering Bluetooth 5.3, a good set of 5G bands, NFC, and an optical in-screen module that&apos;s unerringly accurate — if located a bit lower on the screen than I&apos;d usually like. There isn&apos;t anything awry with the battery either, and the 5100mAh battery consistently manages to last a day and a half between charges. Unlike most phones in this category, you get a charger bundled in the box, and that is good to see.</p>

<p>Coming to the camera, the highlight this year is that the phone gets the same 200MP main camera as the Pro+ model, and it takes great photos in most scenarios.</p>

<p>Daylight shots have good color vibrancy and detail, and the phone does a good job with foliage and clouds. There&apos;s good dynamic range as well, and I like Xiaomi&apos;s color tuning to Samsung in this category. Low-light shots come out with good detail and color rendition as well, and while there is some noise, on the whole, the larger sensor along with tweaks to the tuning means you get usable shots even in challenging situations.</p>

<p>Using the Redmi Note 13 Pro alongside other mid-range devices, there&apos;s the clear sense that Xiaomi intentionally hobbled the phone. It misses out on IP68 ingress protection — you get an IP54 rating instead, and while it allows the device to withstand splashes of water, it doesn&apos;t cover being submerged underwater. Talking of missing features, the phone has 67W charging tech instead of the 120W standard that you get on the Pro+ model.</p>
<p>But what&apos;s particularly irritating is that the device misses out on Wi-Fi 6 connectivity; you get Wi-Fi ac instead, and that just isn&apos;t good enough on a mid-range phone in 2024. Xiaomi trying to nickel-and-dime users on the hardware side of things is in poor taste, and the brand really ought to have done better in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fQhRzkxz8hFo9XQYdbeLqT" name="redmi-note-13-pro-4.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQhRzkxz8hFo9XQYdbeLqT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the main 200MP camera is good, the wide-angle lens is sub-par to say the least, and the 2MP macro module shouldn&apos;t have been included at all. Xiaomi still doesn&apos;t offer 4K at 60fps, and there is no justification to not include the feature. The front 16MP camera also needs an overhaul, and while it takes passable shots during the day, that&apos;s just not the case in scenes with challenging lighting situations.</p>
<p>Then there&apos;s the software. Xiaomi had plenty of time to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> to the device out of the box, but it chose to bundle the phone with Android 13 instead; this means the brand doesn&apos;t have to bother with Android 17 in three years&apos; time, and it still gets to say that it delivered three platform updates.</p><p>The software itself still has plenty of bloatware, and while it is optimized better than MIUI 14, I don&apos;t see enough tangible differences to justify the new moniker.</p>

It has a more interesting design than the Redmi Note 13 Pro, and while it doesn&apos;t use glass, the pattern at the back is unique. You also get better hardware, two usable cameras at the back, and the most refined software in this segment.</p><p>If you&apos;ve used a Xiaomi phone in the past and like all the MIUI features, you should take a look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x6-pro-review">POCO X6 Pro</a>. The camera is almost as good, and you get powerful hardware, great battery life with the same 67W charging tech, and it comes with Android 14 out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're currently using a Xiaomi phone</li><li>You need a good AMOLED screen</li><li>You want all-day battery</li><li>You need a 3.5mm jack</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a phone with a good value</li><li>You need clutter-free software</li><li>You need timely updates</li></ul>
<p>The Redmi Note 13 Pro clearly has a lot going for it; the design is among the best in this segment — as is the screen — and the hardware holds up in daily usage scenarios. If you&apos;re coming from an older Redmi phone, you will find plenty to like here. That said, Xiaomi&apos;s abysmal software policy means you don&apos;t get as many updates as you should, and the UI itself isn&apos;t any different to MIUI 14.</p><p>Ultimately, that&apos;s what limits the potential of the Redmi Note 13 Pro. This is a good phone letdown by poor decision-making, and with plenty of great alternatives to choose from, the Redmi Note 13 Pro just doesn&apos;t do enough to justify its price tag. If you need a new phone, you&apos;re better off with the POCO X6 Pro or the Nothing Phone 2a.</p>

A lot of that is down to the hardware; the Open has a gorgeous design, smooth hinge with no visible crease, excellent internal hardware, a larger battery than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, 67W charging, and terrific cameras.</p><p>While there were software issues out of the box, these have been addressed with subsequent updates. With the Open gaining decent momentum, it&apos;s now time to take a look at what the Open 2 could bring to the table. Obviously, there isn&apos;t much in the way of information about the foldable just yet, but that will change over the coming months. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-design"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK" name="oneplus-open-35.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus designed the Open in collaboration with OPPO, and that&apos;s immediately evident when viewing the device next to the Find N2. In fact, the Find N3 is identical to the Open, with the only difference being that it is limited to China, whereas the Open is sold in global markets. </p><p>As such, it is unlikely we&apos;ll see any major design change with the Open 2. While OPPO likes to switch up the design of its Find X devices — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> has a distinct design that stands out — it has maintained the same styling to all of its foldables, and that isn&apos;t likely to change. </p><p>What could be different is a new hinge that is even lighter than the previous generation. Honor has the distinction of the thinnest foldable in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, and as this is a key area of contention between all the Chinese manufacturers, it is entirely likely the Open 2 will feature a redesigned hinge. In fact, recent leaks point to the fact that the Open 2&apos;s hinge will be lighter and sturdier, and it will be interesting to see if it ends up being thinner than the Magic V2. </p>

<p>The OnePlus Open has an outstanding hardware package, and that is set to continue with the Open 2. The upcoming foldable will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it should retain the same 67W charging tech. </p><p>OnePlus isn&apos;t messing with battery tech this year, and while it has 150W charging available, it isn&apos;t usable in North America, so for devices that are launching globally, it is limiting the charging potential to 100W or 67W. Considering the limited room on a foldable, I don&apos;t see any changes in this area. </p><p>Having said that, the Open 2 is likely to include a larger battery that lasts noticeably longer. There hasn&apos;t been any confirmation about the battery size, but OnePlus is said to offer up to a 5000mAh battery on the foldable. </p><p>The rest of the hardware is likely to be unchanged, but I&apos;ll update this post once we have credible details. </p>

<p>OnePlus did all the right things when it comes to the Open cameras, with the foldable offering a fabulous set of lenses at the back. With 2024 phones pushing the boundaries of camera tech — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, Find X7 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor magic 6 Pro</a> all have sizeable gains — the upcoming foldable should have some of these gains baked in. </p><p>Then again, considering the launch window of the Open 2, it could be a while before we know what camera hardware the device is packing to any reasonable degree. What you need to know at this point is that the cameras should be on the same level as the OnePlus 12, and that&apos;s a terrific starting point. </p>

<p>OnePlus usually likes to have a major release in Q4, but it may be doing things a bit differently with the Open 2. While an earlier launch positions the Open 2 against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, it looks like OnePlus is mulling launching the foldable in 2025 instead. </p><p>That&apos;s an interesting move, and it means the Open 2 will debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> instead. Of course, this is just conjecture at this point, and we don&apos;t know if OnePlus is actually delaying the launch until next year. But as always, I&apos;ll update this post once more information becomes available. </p>

<h2 id="oneplus-needs-to-add-wireless-charging-2">OnePlus needs to add wireless charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM" name="oneplus-open-39.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t know who signed off on not including wireless charging on the OnePlus Open, but it is the biggest limitation on the device. Sure, the phone was designed in conjunction with OPPO, and the Chinese manufacturer doesn&apos;t offer wireless charging on its own devices — so you don&apos;t get one here.</p><p>However, the Open is sold in a lot of global markets, and with OnePlus positioning it as the ideal alternative to Samsung in North America, it needed to nail the table stakes features. While the battery life itself is much better than Samsung&apos;s foldables, the fact that it is limited to wired charging — no matter how fast — makes it a little less enticing.</p><p>With the Open 2, OnePlus has to rectify this particular issue and offer wireless charging out of the box. While it&apos;s okay for a device like the OnePlus 11 to miss out on it, the Open costs nearly thrice as much at $1,699, and not having the ability to charge wirelessly is a shortsighted move.</p>
<h2 id="polished-software-out-of-the-box-2">Polished software out of the box</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF" name="oneplus-open-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a regular complaint with all OnePlus phones, but I want to see better software out of the box with the Open 2, not a few months down the line. Yes, the ColorOS integration made things that much more difficult, but it&apos;s been two years now, and that cannot be the excuse to deliver shoddy software on every new phone.</p><p>OnePlus has shown that it can deliver; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> was devoid of any major bugs, and it was optimized for the hardware. I know achieving the same on a foldable is twice as hard as there are two screens to deal with and numerous scaling issues, but the Open 2 has to do better. And while we&apos;re at it, can I get a 5x5 grid? I still don&apos;t understand why that isn&apos;t available on the Open.</p>
<h2 id="ipx8-water-resistance-2">IPX8 water resistance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C" name="oneplus-open-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Open has IPX4 water resistance, and that means that it can withstand an occasional splash of water. OnePlus says that the hinge automatically ejects any dust that manages to get in, and even though it isn&apos;t tested, it should do a decent job with any dust ingress as well.</p><p>That said, I&apos;d like to see IPX8 water resistance on the Open 2. That would make the foldable that much more resilient to the elements, and bring it to parity with Samsung&apos;s foldables.</p>
<h2 id="stylus-integration-would-be-nice-to-have-2">Stylus integration would be nice to have</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is another one of those features that feels motivated by OPPO. As the brand doesn&apos;t pay particular attention to global markets, adding stylus integration wasn&apos;t a priority, and the Open misses out on it. I&apos;m not saying the foldable should have come with a stylus in the box — even Samsung isn&apos;t that generous — but the ability to use a stylus with the inner screen makes the foldable that much more useful.</p><p>Even if OnePlus decides it doesn&apos;t want to bother making its own stylus, there are plenty of aftermarket styli that do a great job with note-taking and doodling. I have a half-dozen styli in the house, and while I don&apos;t really use them as much as I should, having the option to do so on the Open 2 would go a long way.</p>

They make for a great desktop computer for most people, excelling at things like web browsing, social media, online shopping, and entertainment. If you want a cheap and easy-to-use computer for your living room so you can watch Netflix and browse Instagram on a big screen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebox">a Chromebox</a> is great.</p><p>The drawback is that they&apos;re not mobile; a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/buy-a-chromebook-not-a-chromebox">Chromebook and USB-C Hub does everything a Chromebox can do</a> and has the benefit of being able to unplug everything and go along with you.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are a few reasons why a Chromebox could be a better choice. The Aopen Chromebox Mini 2 excels at both because of how it was designed and built: its made for enterprise applications. </p><p>Very few people in a Fortune 500 company use a Chromebox as a server or desktop, so what does that mean? A look at the Chromebox Mini 2 tells the story.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-a-typical-chromebox-2"> A typical Chromebox</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YmFQ3a9v2FhTZinSLaNMiM" name="chromebox-hero.jpg" alt="Chromebox" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YmFQ3a9v2FhTZinSLaNMiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2009" height="1130" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aopen.com/US_en/products_info/AOPEN_Chromebox_Mini_2/">Chromebox Mini 2</a> is like using any other modestly spec&apos;d Chromebox. It runs the Chrome Browser like a champ, having plenty of memory for literally hundreds of open tabs.</p><p>Support for two 4K monitors means the video looks great. The Celeron processor isn&apos;t the strongest chip out there, but it has adequate power for decoding streaming media or any other sort of entertainment you can imagine while being efficient—it isn&apos;t going to get too hot.</p><p>Because it runs the same Chrome OS as every other Chromebox, you have support for many Android applications as well as Chrome-centric apps. If that&apos;s not enough for you, many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">Linux apps</a> will install and run great, thanks to the Intel X86 architecture. </p>

<p>You could use the Chromebox Mini 2 the same way you use any other Chromebox. From a software and usability point of view, not much stands out. Chromeboxes, no matter the manufacturer, are all designed to work the same seamless way and have mostly the same set of features.</p><p>So what makes a Chromebox "Enterprise-grade?" Are companies really using these? How? Why? That&apos;s a lot of questions, and a few of the Chromebox Mini 2&apos;s features tell the entire story.</p>
<h2 id="ready-for-business-2">Ready for business</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LvmdnCXgq3AAam66cdYqJm" name="Aopen-Chromebox-Mini-2-2.jpg" alt="Aopen Chromebox Mini 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LvmdnCXgq3AAam66cdYqJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Buried among the specs are a few things that you won&apos;t find on most Chromeboxes or Chromebooks. Let&apos;s have a look at each for a better idea of what makes the Chromebox Mini 2 ready for commercial use:</p><p><strong>MIL-STD, fanless construction</strong>. The Chromebox Mini 2&apos;s body is a solid chunk of aluminum that acts as a heatsink. Combined with a low-power chip like the Celeron N4500, that means as long as you provide ambient air, it&apos;s never going to overheat. </p><p><strong>50,000-Hour MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)</strong>. That means the Chromebox Mini 2 was designed to run for 5.7 years without interruption. Attach the power supply to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-767-powerhouse-review">UPS solution</a>, and it will run until it&apos;s time to be replaced five years from now.</p><p><strong>External Power Switch</strong>. The front panel has a set of connectors, so a normally open remote switch can be wired in. This will act as a power button that you can mount remotely, allowing the Chromebox Mini 2 to be placed out of the reach of curious fingers like mine.</p><p> <strong>APAR (AC Power Auto Recovery)</strong>. If the Chromebook Mini 2 loses power, it will return to the state it was in once power is restored. The board has a rechargeable battery and software to enable this, eliminating the need for a technician to be present during start-up.</p>

<p>You&apos;ve probably seen a Windows error screen on a sign or menu somewhere. These features are all designed to make sure you only see what a company wants you to see.</p><p>You&apos;ll find Chromeboxes used for things like POS terminals and control/informational displays in factories. But they&apos;re <em>really</em> popular for powering digital signs. You may not know it, but you&apos;ve likely seen a sign or menu powered by a Chromebox because it&apos;s easy to set up and well-designed for the task.</p>
<p>When you hear the words "enterprise Chromebox" this is what you should think of. Commercial grade is probably a better term because a Chromebox is perfect for many commercial applications. One designed especially for the task, like the Chromebox Mini 2, makes things even better.</p><p>A simple-to-understand but common scenario: I want to place a menu above the bar in my establishment. The best way to do it is to create a simple backend that builds a viewable webpage in any browser because it&apos;s easy to make quick adjustments.</p><p>If I place a Chromebox behind a large display, I can point the browser to that webpage. I can even use two monitors for another view, an ad, or a menu at the other end of the bar. </p><p>If I can wire a remote switch, know that I won&apos;t have to attach a keyboard and do anything if it accidentally loses power. Know it will run for five years without any issues and that you won&apos;t ever have to worry about cleaning a dusty fan intake. When things aren&apos;t more expensive—the Chromebox Mini 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdw.com/product/aopen-chromebox-mini-2-intel-celeron-n4500-fanless-8-gb-ram-32-gb-e/7868777">retails for $260</a>—I know which model I am buying.</p>

<p>You probably don&apos;t own an establishment with a bar, so you don&apos;t need a digital sign or menu. But I&apos;ll bet you own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">a television</a>. Everything that makes the Chromebox Mini 2 perfect for a business also makes it great for your entertainment center.</p><p>Maybe you have gone all-out with a surround system and built-in audio receiver stored inside a dedicated media cabinet in your house. Or maybe you just have a big television on a stand in the living room. A Chromebox is a great way to make the most out of it all.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t a "regular" review of the Chromebox Mini 2. If it were, I&apos;d tell you that if you need a Chromebox and are interested in any of the extra features designed for commercial use, this one is for you. <strong>Five stars all the way</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rand Fishkin of SparkToro received and published documents detailing Google Search's internal APIs, search ranking factors, and Google's data collection practices.</li><li>Some leaked information contradicts Google's public statements about search algorithms and ranking factors.</li><li>The documents were accidentally made public on GitHub from March 27 to May 7 and later indexed by a third-party service.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A massive leak of what seems to be thousands of internal documents offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">Google Search</a>, suggesting that Google may have been misleading the public about its search engine operations for years.</p><p>The documents were handed over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin</a> of SparkToro, a software company, who then made them public. Fishkin, a seasoned SEO expert with over a decade of experience, says a source gave him 2,500 pages of documents, hoping to debunk the "lies" Google employees had said about how the search algorithm actually works (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>The documents spill the beans on internal APIs and break down what impacts search results. From these leaked papers, you can get a general sense of what works and what doesn&apos;t for ranking on Google, highlighting the key elements that matter most.</p><p>These leaks cover a wide range of topics, such as Google&apos;s data collection, which sites get a boost for sensitive issues like elections, and how Google treats small websites.</p><p>Interestingly, some information conflicts with what Google has publicly said. For example, Google has denied treating subdomains differently in rankings and claimed they don&apos;t use click-centric signals for content indexing, yet the leaks suggest otherwise, according to Fishkin.</p><p>Other surprises include using a sandbox for new sites, giving sites an "authority score" to bump them up in search results, and more.</p><p>Google has yet to respond to Android Central&apos;s request for comments, but we&apos;ll update this article when we do.</p><p>It looks like Google accidentally made these documents public on GitHub around March 27, and they were taken down by May 7. However, a third-party service indexed them, so they&apos;re still accessible.</p><p>Even though these documents reveal potential ranking factors, they don&apos;t specify the importance of each one in the final ranking, as SEO expert <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank">Mike King</a> highlighted in his overview.</p><p>Earlier this year, Google launched a major Search update that prioritizes "helpful" content. The new algorithms are designed to determine if a webpage is made for search engines or real people.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>In an emailed statement to Android Central, a Google representative cautions the public not to jump to conclusions without all the facts.</p><p>"We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about Search based on out-of-context, outdated, or incomplete information," the spokesperson said. "We’ve shared extensive information about how Search works and the types of factors that our systems weigh, while also working to protect the integrity of our results from manipulation."</p><p>Google also mentioned that it does not traditionally comment on the specifics of its ranking systems. Sharing such sensitive information could help spammers and bad actors manipulate the results, as per the company.</p><p>Search is always changing, and Google says it&apos;s constantly tweaking its systems to provide the best results. The spokesperson added that while Google&apos;s core ranking principles stay the same, individual signals can change often, be dropped, or just be tested and never used.</p><p>The search giant also reiterated its commitment to providing accurate information while protecting the integrity of search results. Finally, Google highlighted the potential for misinterpretation of the leaked documents.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Tuesday (May 28), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/14919062">announced</a> that it will shut down the Business Messages feature on Google Maps and Search. This feature allowed users to chat directly with businesses through their profiles. Businesses could respond to users either themselves or via a chatbot.</p><p>The tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/28/google-business-messages-shutting-down/">emailed</a> several business owners, saying they will not be able to receive messages from their Google Business profile starting July 31. </p><p>"We acknowledge this may be difficult news—as we continually improve our tools, we occasionally have to make difficult decisions that may impact the businesses and partners we work with," Google said in the email.</p><p>The removal of Business Messages means users can no longer initiate quick chats with businesses they find on Maps and Search. This feature could negatively impact communication, as instant conversations will no longer be accessible. Google says users can still reach out to establishments via calls or emails.</p><p>On the user&apos;s end, beginning July 15, customers won&apos;t be able to start new chat conversations with your business from Google. And people in existing chat conversations will be notified about the feature phaseout.</p>

<p>The company assures that customers can still find and contact businesses through Google Search and Maps through website links, business descriptions, photos, and anything else shared on the existing Business Profile.</p><p>"It&apos;s important to us that Google remains a helpful partner as you manage your business, and we remain committed to this mission," Google added.</p><p>Why Google chose such a route with the Business Messages feature remains a mystery. The Google Maps Messaging button launched in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-killing-off-the-messaging-service-inside-google-maps/">2017</a> and was called "Google My Business Chat." The messaging button would launch the phone&apos;s SMS app or a Google Allo (remember this?) chat box.</p><p>Earlier this year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-shutting-down-business-profile-websites">shut down</a> websites created with Google Business Profiles.

<ul><li>Google stated that Chrome users on Android are in line to receive "minimized custom tabs" for in-app browsing.</li><li>When opening a link, users will notice a new down arrow in the in-app Chrome window, which will shrink it into a floating UI window.</li><li>From there, users can quickly re-tap the window to get back into what they were looking at.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest update for Chrome on Android brings "minimized custom tabs" to developers to better the user experience.</p><p>According to a Chromium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/multi-tasking-with-minimized-custom-tabs.html">blog post</a>, Chrome&apos;s minimized custom tabs are a feature that lets users multitask effortlessly and seamlessly in apps. The post states developers will see this change occur automatically during the roll-out of update M124 in Chrome. On the other hand, users will notice a "minimize" icon when opening a link.</p><p>Using Gmail as an example, Google states that Chrome will open at the bottom of their UI when users click on a link.</p><p>From there, the window can fully expand to the length of a device&apos;s display. The top left corner holds a down arrow, which will minimize the Chrome window into a floating square on the bottom right of your display. Users can quickly tap this box to re-open the Chrome window they were just in.</p><p>Google hopes this "enhances the in-app browsing experience." The company adds that this custom tab method is integrated to help users open links and browse better "across surfaces." Essentially, these custom tabs should work well with other apps across Android.</p><p>When minimized, the custom tab only displays the webpage name and site domain. The site&apos;s logo can also appear, though that depends on the website you&apos;re accessing. Otherwise, it seems users will see the Chrome browser logo in its place.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs">Chrome for Developers</a> explains that minimizing custom tabs ensures that users can put them away and re-open them without losing their place. Additionally, a user&apos;s saved passwords, payment methods, and more will appear as if they were using the main Chrome browser.</p><p>Google had originally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-chrome-custom-tabs-feature-might-add-picture-in-picture-support">started playtesting</a> this update for Chrome&apos;s custom tabs in March during version 122 on Android. Most of the feature&apos;s functionality has remained consistent throughout its beta, with the picture-in-picture style tabs acting as a way to help users stay on task. The beta showed that these multitasking custom tabs don&apos;t work well with YouTube.</p><p>However, the YouTube app already lets users hop out of the app with the video continuously playing in a floating window on their UI.</p><p>Refinements are still pouring in for Chrome&apos;s Custom Tabs as the most recent update for them involved "Read Aloud." Chrome Canary users picked up the ability for the browser to read a page&apos;s contents out loud for them earlier this year.</p>

<p>Phone 2a debuted recently as Nothing&apos;s first cheaper Android phone. Since the company has managed to keep the phone in the limelight with prompt updates and new colorways, there&apos;s now a new special edition of the same budget handset.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Phone 2a</a> is already a great-looking phone as it retains Nothing&apos;s signature translucent design. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheaper Android handset</a> now has a Special Edition, which looks like a new colorway at first glance, yet it still incorporates Nothing&apos;s signature colors.</p>

<p>Until now, the company has blended in colors like red, yellow, and blue for its audio products separately, such as Ear, Ear, and Phone 2a, respectively. Taking things forward, the Special Edition Phone 2a blends in all three colors at the back as part of a new design, making the first Nothing product to feature more than a single or couple of different colors.</p><p>Adam, Design Director at Nothing, has further shared about the product in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/10897-introducing-phone-2a-special-edition">community post</a>, indicating, "We are very happy to unveil Phone (2a) Special Edition. The first product to explore our palette of the primary colors: red, blue and yellow. Its overall aesthetic references some of our design heroes from the past, whilst creating a new expression for a smartphone. Elevating a functional device into a striking piece of art."</p>

<p>This year&apos;s Samsung summer comes into focus as the company&apos;s upcoming foldable and smartwatch appear at the FCC.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/05/29/samsungs-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-galaxy-flip-6-hit-fcc/">DroidLife</a> spotted the Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s FCC listing, confirming some of the extra specifications regarding connectivity. The database gave the device an "A3LSMF741U" ID number, which contains Flip 6&apos;s apparent SM-F741U model number from previous rumors.</p><p>The clamshell&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=Y&application_id=1t4G8YUYURx8lUzCI%2B6gUA%3D%3D&fcc_id=A3LSMF741U">listing confirms</a> that the device will support 5G cellular networks. Additionally, the Flip 6 will have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC capabilities alongside wireless charging, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">similar to last year</a>.</p><p>Joining the expected foldable phone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=Y&application_id=wUkjFAQycN8glZZ5SB3Ucw%3D%3D&fcc_id=A3LSML705">what could be</a> Samsung&apos;s new top-tier smartwatch, the "Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra." The publication states that the Watch 7 Ultra has been rumored with model number SM-L705. The FCC&apos;s listing ID features the same number, furthering speculation about the device&apos;s existence.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s information shows that the device will support an LTE connection. The publication notes that such support will involve the "major" U.S. brands. Other specifications learned from the listing include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, wireless charging, and NFC capabilities.</p>

<p>The hype is building for a "Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra" with the latest batch of leaks showing up recently with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">supposed renderings</a>. The device may sport quite the design shift as Samsung could go for a mix between a squarish chassis and a circular display design. The tipster suggested that the Watch 7 UItra could see a 1.5-inch display in diameter. Its overall dimensions make it appear as though it&apos;ll be slightly larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>.</p><p>The renderings show a new third button joining the typical two on the watch&apos;s right side. Rumors claim this to be an "action button" of some sort.</p><p>The Flip 6 alongside the Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-qualcomm-exclusivity-choice-report">was rumored</a> to drop Samsung&apos;s Exynos chip in favor of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 exclusively. The company had reportedly discussed the idea of "cost control" and "efficiency," which were the driving forces behind the chip decision. So, instead of featuring Qualcomm&apos;s chip in the U.S. and Exynos in other regions, it seems everyone will get the same experience chip-wise.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">an FCC appearance</a> yesterday (May 28), and with the listing came major spoilers about what it&apos;s offering. The database confirmed the existence of nine ring sizes for the device, alongside a quick look at a charging "cradle." A more concrete look at the cradle wasn&apos;t available, however, it seems Samsung will mark each one with a consumer&apos;s chosen Galaxy Ring size.</p>

<hr>
<p>Microsoft is giving Telegram an AI boost and touting it as your "everyday companion."</p><p>Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/copilot-for-social?form=MY02F9">announced</a> that its AI chatbot, Copilot, has arrived on Telegram today (May 29). Similar to the AI experience users would get through Windows, Copilot in Telegram is powered by OpenAI&apos;s GPT and Bing Search. The company states that the AI uses "natural language to provide responses on a range of topics."</p><p>Such topics include gaming and sports. For the former, users can ask Copilot in Telegram about the latest game releases and walkthroughs. For sports, the AI can quickly grab scores, schedules, "and more" for those curious about the NFL, NBA, and the NHL, among others.</p><p>Other topics <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-google-assistant-chromeos">Copilot</a> can work with are traveling, fitness, food, music, romance, movies, and brain teasers to pass the time.</p><p>Microsoft states that Copilot&apos;s initial beta period in Telegram limits the AI to text-based prompts.</p><p>Users can get started by hopping into the Telegram app on desktop or mobile. Searching for "CopilotOfficialBot" in the app will produce the AI&apos;s chat thread. Simply pose your question or give the AI some instructions and let it do the rest. Microsoft adds that users can also deliver a follow-up question to the AI after it&apos;s delivered a response to your query.</p><p>Copilot&apos;s arrival on Telegram is free, meaning users on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS can get started today (May 29). When using Copilot, those concerned about their privacy and security can check out Microsoft&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement">comprehensive</a>" approach.</p>

<p>Microsoft dropped its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">Copilot app for Android</a> onto the Play Store early in January. Utilizing OpenAI&apos;s GPT-4 model, all users can ask the bot questions or ask it to write content for them. Moreover, the app features DALL-E 3, a model designed to handle a user&apos;s text-to-image generation requests. Microsoft classified this as the "imaginative" side of Copilot.</p><p>There&apos;s also an "Image Creator," which gives users the tools to make social media items, logo designs, illustrations for books, and more. With Copilot starting out as a beta in Telegram, and only accepting text-based prompts, perhaps there&apos;s a future where we see DALL-E 3&apos;s influence in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">popular messaging app</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, an update for Copilot in February enabled the AI to be used as a user&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">default assistant</a> on Android. Users can swipe diagonally from the corner of their device or long-press their power button to produce it. However, it&apos;s not entirely seamless as instead of experiencing a floating UI, keeping you where you are, users are thrown into the main Copilot app.</p>
