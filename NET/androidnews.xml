                    <p><p><em><strong>Something different </strong></em></p>
<p>If you’re looking for something different from the usual, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra stands out among the pack. It has AI features to rival other brands, though some are still in beta. It offers support for hi-res music, fast refresh rate for gaming and entertainment, and solid specs, overall. But it’s more of a short-term phone given the limited software and security update support.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is about as premium an Android device as you can get. It has lots of AI features, being among one of the first Android devices to incorporate many of them. It’s a stunning, durable, and high-quality phone with impressive specs. But it’s also one of the more expensive Android devices. With that said, it will be supported by software and security updates for a long, long time.</p></p>

<p>If AI is on the mind, two phones that really focus on incorporating AI features are the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. These are two very different phones, however, when it comes to price point. Naturally, Galaxy devices have a reputation for being among the most popular and respected Android phones around. How does the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra stack up? Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is the newer phone of the two, introduced in March 2024. Each has black sides with Skyline Blue, Eternal Black, Misty Grey, or Desert Sand on the back. The screen is a 6.78-inch flexible E6 AMOLED display that boasts a 2,400 x 1,080-pixel resolution and is protected by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>. Employing a glossy matte finish with the Chinese symbol for “people” on it, the phone is both durable and elegant. It also meets IP68 certification for water and dust resistance. </p><p>The screen is ultra-bright, so you can comfortably view it in any setting, including bright sunlight, thanks to 1,600 nits brightness and 2,500 nits peak brightness. To keep up with all types of tasks, from basic e-mails to intense gaming sessions, the screen refresh rate can flip from 1-120Hz as needed. There is a boost option to go up to 144Hz as well, but Android Central’s Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">says in his Zenfone 11 Ultra review</a> that it only works with a limited selection of games and can’t be manually turned on. </p><p>A smidge shorter and lighter than the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is described by Jonnalagadda as being tall and heavy, but he adds that the weight distribution is balanced wonderfully, so it’s not uncomfortable to hold. The phone comes with 256GB or 512GB storage, and it does not have a microSD card slot. </p><p>Running on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with the ZenUI overlay, Jonnalagadda loves the customizability offered by ZenUI and says it’s fluid and nice looking. However, he did note that he was experiencing some issues with push notifications. The one major strike against this phone is the fact that it only comes with two major software updates and four years of security updates, which is far less than most premium phones nowadays, including the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. </p><p>Equipped with an impressive 5,500mAh battery, you can be confident that the phone will last all day, and potentially even beyond. It also supports 65W HyperCharge fast charging along with wireless charging. </p><p>Along with dual stereo speakers that Jonnalagadda says are among the “loudest in this category,” the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra also has dual mics with ASUS Noise Reduction technology, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, and dual SIMs. Operating on the 5G network, there’s also a fingerprint sensor and face unlock options. One stand-out feature is that this phone has a 3.5mm input for connecting wired headphones, which is something a lot of other phone manufacturers are doing away with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nzWWocqmTAkz7iYBZByzoX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-display-sunlight-01.jpg" alt="The vibrant display of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzWWocqmTAkz7iYBZByzoX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> comes in Titanium Gray, Black, Violet, or Yellow, as well as Samsung exclusive colors Titanium Green, Blue, and Orange. As the name implies, it has a durable titanium frame with Corning Gorilla Armor that further improves durability, scratch resistance, and reduces glare. It has a more premium look and feel, and it’s more durable overall, including meeting the IP68 specification as well. </p><p>With a tad larger 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X QHD+ screen, it’s also higher resolution at 3,088 x 1,440. The 2,600 nits peak brightness means you’ll have no trouble viewing the phone outdoors in bright sunlight. This is further solidified with Samsung’s Vision Booster technology. The same adaptive 120Hz refresh rate ensures the phone runs smoothly whether you’re posting to social media or playing a graphics-heavy game. </p><p>There’s an additional 1TB option along with 256GB and 512GB, but like the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, this is not expandable. It, too, runs on Android 14 alongside Samsung’s One UI 6.1 overlay, so you can enjoy additional customization options with this phone as well. One feature that makes this phone stand out is the inclusion of a Samsung S Pen, which is ideal for sketching, taking notes, and seamlessly navigating without having to use your finger or thumb. The real stand-out here, however, is that Samsung supports the phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">seven years of both software and security updates</a>, so you can rest assured that it will be “current” for many years to come. </p><p>The battery is not as big at 5,000mAh, but it <em>does</em> support fast wireless charging 2.0 via the WPC standard, so you’ll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-series-chargers">need a specific type of charger</a> with a 45W adapter and 5A USB-C cable. It also works with Wireless PowerShare, so the phone can be used to recharge other compatible devices when placed atop its surface, like other Galaxy phones, Galaxy Buds, and more. </p><p>Additional features include dual stereo speakers, 5G, Wi-Fi Direct, and Bluetooth 5.3, but there’s no headphone jack.</p>

<p>By the numbers only, these two phones look similar. But let’s break it down further.</p>

<p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor and 12 or 16GB RAM, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is a pretty powerful device. It also comes with lots of AI features, though many are still in beta mode at the time of this writing. AI translator, for example, can translate your words into text and/or voice for the person on the other end of the call and vice versa. AI transcript transcribes phone calls in real-time, while AI wallpaper creates a personalized image for you based on the styles you love.   </p><p>Along with AI noise cancellation, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra also has dual stereo speakers and supports lossless, Hi-Res audio up to 384kHz/32-bit with compatible wired headphones. With Dirac Virtuo for Headphone spatial sound and aptX audio codecs support, you can further enjoy an immersive personal listening experience. Along with listening to music, Jonnalagadda says this feature makes a difference when watching streaming content and playing games. </p><p>The ASUS GlideX feature makes it easy to mirror your phone and share videos and photos across other devices, using the phone as a webcam and creating an improved desktop set-up. There’s also a feature called Phone Link that makes it possible to sync the phone with a laptop or PC and easily transfer files, take calls, and manage everyday productivity tasks. </p><p>There are features for gamers as well, including a game turbo engine that Jonnalagadda calls the best he has used on any phone. To ensure you have an uninterrupted video gaming experience, the Video Genie feature mutes calls and notifications until you’re done your playing session. One thing to note is that Jonnalagadda did notice some overheating after long gaming sessions.</p>

<p>Powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra offers 12GB RAM and a host of AI features as well. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-galaxy-s24-live-translate">Live Translate</a> offers real-time, two-way voice and text translation, and an interpreter feature displays live conversations on a split screen, both with and without an active connection. </p><p>With AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist</a>, get help composing text messages. AI in the keyboard, meanwhile, can help translate messages and e-mails in real time, both on the phone itself as well as while connected to Android Auto. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-transcribe-and-summarize-using-samsung-notes-on-the-galaxy-s24">Samsung Notes</a>, use Note Assist to get AI-generated summaries, templates, and more. Transcript Assist also uses AI to help transcribe recordings, even summarize them. </p><p>One of the coolest AI features is Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which allows you to circle, highlight, scribble on, or tap an image on the screen to learn more about it. You’ll get contextual results right on the same screen without having to open a web browser separately. Depending on the type of content, you may also see additional overviews powered by AI that can tell you more about everything from a cultural dish to a plant or a piece of clothing or be able to ask further questions using natural language queries. </p><p>The phone has features for gamers as well, including a larger vapor chamber designed to improve thermal control to prevent the phone from overheating. For security, enjoy Samsung Knox, Advanced Intelligence settings for disabling AI features if preferred, secure Wi-Fi, and more. </p><p>Both these phones are powerful and offer plenty of AI goodies, though Samsung’s AI features are fully available now while the ASUS ones are still in beta mode. But the features work similarly, allowing you to get the most out of your phone.</p>
<h2 id="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-taking-photos-2">ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Taking photos</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-12.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nowadays, everyone takes photos with their smartphone, so ensuring the one you choose has decent camera is crucial.</p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra has a 50MP main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide camera, a 32MP telephoto camera with a 3x lens, and a 32MP front camera. After his tests, Jonnalagadda says photos had great detail both during the day and night, offering great dynamic range and color accuracy. In low-light scenarios, he did notice some fringing and a slight loss of detail. In comparison to older-model Zenfone models, however, he says this camera is the best yet. </p><p>The camera has some of the typical features you’d expect from a phone camera, including portrait mode, along with unique ones as well. The portrait video mode, for example, uses AI to provide a depth-of-field effect, and can recognize the faces of both people and pets. The Super Hyper Steady EIS algorithm works in tandem with other features to ensure smooth photos and photos. </p><p>Other camera features include 10x zoom with HyperClarity AI algorithm and direct processing of RAW files. AI Object Sense recognizes objects and optimizes them, and semantic search lets you locate photos in your albums based on specific parameters, like event, time, location, or object, using AI assistance.  </p>

<p>Samsung is known for offering great cameras with its Galaxy devices, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras</a> are no exception. It comes with a 200MP wide camera, a 50MP telephoto camera, a 10MP telephoto camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, and a 12MP front camera. There’s a ProVisual Engine that uses AI to improve photos, Quad Tele System with a 5x optical zoom lens that works with the 50MP sensor, and 100x enhanced digital zoom. </p><p>You can take improved photos at night using the Nightography mode as well as features like Space Zoom. The wider optical image stabilization also helps reduce motion blue, while Dedicated ISP Block helps reduce noise in videos. Analyzing gyro information in a video, the phone can also analyze your movements and the subject’s movements to help remove noise. </p><p>Use Super HDR to get a preview of an image before snapping it, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> editing tools can be used to tweak it once you’re done.

<p>The decision between the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra might seem like a tough one. With the same processor, the option for more RAM, same refresh rate, wireless charging, larger battery, same durable design, and more, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is very tempting, especially considering it costs much less. But there’s more to it than that. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is indeed a phone you’ll love using, and it will enable you to keep up with everything you want to do, from productivity to entertainment, casual gaming, experimenting with AI, snapping photos, and staying in touch. But the big deciding factor will be longevity. </p><p>With Samsung supporting the Galaxy S24 Ultra for seven years of OS and security updates, it’s more than three times as long as ASUS offers for the Zenfone 11 Ultra. This becomes moot if you plan to trade in or upgrade your phone in a few years anyway. For those who finance their phones and will be handing them back in after the contract period to get something new, this won’t matter. If you are buying the phone outright, however, you will get better value with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. </p><p>Not only will you be able to hold onto the phone for 5+ years and still be able to enjoy the most up-to-date features (that the phone itself supports), but you’ll get more money for it if you are trading it in or reselling it. So, while you’re spending more, you’re getting something that’s built to last in more ways than one. </p><p>There are other aspects to consider. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a much higher resolution screen, better cameras, and Wireless PowerShare, which is valuable if you have other Samsung products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Samsung Buds</a> and comes in funky colors. When considering overall value, you’ll get more from the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rumors suggest Samsung is working on a new foldable phone model, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra, with upgrades, but its availability in global markets remains uncertain.</li><li>Samsung appears to be preparing only one variant of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra (SM-F958N) specifically for South Korea.</li><li>Limited information suggests the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra may not have variants for other markets, potentially restricting its availability.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier rumors hinted that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-second-model-rumor">might be bringing out a new foldable phone model called the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra</a>, with a few upgrades. Now, a fresh report claims to provide more evidence that this model is real, but that it might not hit every market.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra/" target="_blank">Galaxy Club</a>, the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will go by the model number SM-F956, while its souped-up sibling, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra, will be tagged as SM-F958 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-real-limited-release/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>The report pointed out a trend where "6" typically represents a regular Fold model and "8" stands for Ultra models in recent releases. For instance, the current Galaxy Z Fold 5 is SM-F946, while the upcoming Fold is likely to be SM-F956. Furthermore, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> carries the model number SM-S928.</p><p>Adding to the mix, there&apos;s a recent leak from the well-known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1762764063124144585" target="_blank">Max Jambor</a>, who dropped some hints about three model designations linked to the Z series. For instance, Samsung apparently designated the Galaxy Z Fold 6 as "Q6" and the Z Flip 6 as "B6."</p><p>However, there&apos;s a mysterious "Q6a" designation floating around, and we&apos;re scratching our heads trying to figure out what it might be referring to since no model with that label has surfaced yet.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung seems to be focusing on just one variant of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra, marked as SM-F958N. The "N" suggests it&apos;s tailored specifically for South Korea, leaving the rest of us out in the cold, assuming the ultra-premium model comes out.</p><p>As it stands, there&apos;s no information floating around about models or variants for other markets. Unless we start seeing more model numbers pop up, it seems like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra might just stay within Samsung&apos;s home turf for its release.</p><p>Introducing a pricier foldable might sound risky given the already steep prices of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phonehttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. But Samsung&apos;s been dominating the foldable game lately. So, throwing in a more robust model could actually be a smart move, spicing up the next generation of foldables and giving consumers more options.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google released Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2 about a month ago, addressing significant bugs, and now Beta 2.1 is out with numerous bug fixes.</li><li>The latest update, AP21.240305.005, including the March 2024 security patch, is available for various supported devices, ranging from the Pixel 5a to the latest Pixel models.</li><li>Notable issues in QPR3 Beta 2.1 include launcher crashes, charging problems, frozen apps, and navigation glitches, although it's not as severe as the initial Beta 2 release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s been about a month since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> QPR3 Beta 2 was released, and Google had to tackle some major bugs with that one. It looks like the search giant is still at it because today, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/release-notes" target="_blank">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a> with a ton of bug fixes.</p><p>Even though we&apos;re probably getting QPR3 Beta 3 in a couple of weeks, Google is starting off April with QPR3 Beta 2.1, which comes with another unexpectedly large batch of bug fixes, including the following:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused a device's launcher to crash when trying to view recent apps. (Issue #328803294)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented Pixel Tablet devices from charging while connected to the dock. (Issue #299800125)</li><li>Fixed an issue where swiping up from the bottom of the screen didn't always return to the home screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the layout of notifications on the lock screen to display with additional padding.</li><li>Fixed various issues that were causing frequent "Application not responding" errors for both system and user apps.</li><li>Fixed an issue where swiping down from the top of the screen didn't always show the notification shade.</li><li>Fixed an issue for Pixel Fold devices where sometimes when the device was unfolded, only half of the inner screen displayed content.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented a user's wallpaper settings from being backed up properly.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes stopped the "Quick Tap to start actions" gesture from working.</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, performance, connectivity, interactivity, and camera.</li></ul>
<p>The latest update (AP21.240305.005), including the March 2024 security patch, is now up for grabs on all supported devices: Pixel 5a, 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, 8, 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet.</p><p>A few standout issues to mention are launcher crashes, charging problems, frozen apps, navigation glitches, display issues, and a bunch more. It&apos;s not as bad as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2">mess we had with the original Beta 2 release last month</a>. Still, QPR3 is kind of iffy right now, so you might want to hold off on installing it on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android phone</a>.</p><p>We&apos;re still in the dark about whether Google has sorted out the OTA sideloading problem from last month, which caused some devices to end up being bricked until the files were pulled.</p><p>Google&apos;s stance remains the same, advising testers to just wait for the OTA update to come through; no sideloading is necessary.</p><p>If you&apos;re already part of the Android 14 Beta program, you&apos;ll get the QPR3 Beta 2.1 update automatically via an over-the-air (OTA) download.</p>

<ul><li>It appears that Samsung has returned its burn-in protection measures to the Galaxy S23 Ultra following its One UI 6.1 update.</li><li>Testing shows elements in its status bar have started shifting slightly every so often to help protect the longevity of the OLED display.</li><li>One UI 6.1 started rolling out to several past-gen devices on March 28, bringing with it a few Galaxy AI features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s latest One UI 6.1 update for past-gen devices has seemingly returned a useful longevity feature for your display.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://toranji.ir/2024/03/30/%d8%a8%d8%a7%da%af-%d9%86%d9%85%d8%a7%db%8c%d8%b4%da%af%d8%b1-%d8%b3%d8%a7%d9%85%d8%b3%d9%88%d9%86%da%af-%d8%a8%d8%a7-%d8%a2%d9%be%d8%af%db%8c%d8%aa-one-ui-6-1-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%b7%d8%b1%d9%81-%d8%b4/">Toranji</a> (Persian), Samsung has returned its burn-in protection software for devices rocking an OLED display panel (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/01/samsung-one-ui-6-1-burn-in-protection-update/">9to5Google</a>). The company&apos;s burn-in protection involves a Galaxy device&apos;s status bar, which is typically relatively static. From the publication&apos;s testing, the status bar on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> shifts slightly to the right every few seconds to avoid burn-in.</p><p>Testing also showed that Galaxy phone&apos;s navigation bar elements shift to help preserve the display&apos;s quality.</p><p>Burn-in protection helps to ensure that users are left with lingering UI elements after the display is turned off or elements change. The publication notes that users first noticed a lack of burn-in protection on the device following Android 14 in November.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if the Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series picked up the return of burn-in protection. It would be odd if Samsung didn&apos;t re-enable it for those devices, considering they all boast an AMOLED display like the S23 series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.17%;"><img id="2SHTVknFXohbJU2JKtj3TQ" name="samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-one-ui-6-1-burn-in-returns.gif" alt="A quick video of the return of burn-in protection with One UI 6.1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SHTVknFXohbJU2JKtj3TQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="277" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Toranji)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More importantly, Samsung has kept its promise that it would return the protection measure — albeit a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s23-january-2024-security-patch">little later than expected</a>. The company confirmed around the time of the S23&apos;s January security drop that it would return its burn-in protection. Samsung stated it would arrive with its "next update version," but testing shows its existence following the One UI 6.1 update.</p><p>The latest One UI update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">started rolling out</a> in the U.S. on March 28, bringing the brand&apos;s Galaxy AI software to past-gen devices. The Galaxy S23 series, Flip 5, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series were granted access to features like Google&apos;s "Circle to Search," Live Translate, online summaries, and more.</p><p>A few Generative Edit and Chat Assist features also slipped into the update.</p>

<ul><li>Early rumors suggest Nothing's Phone 3 will feature Qualcomm's toned-down Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC.</li><li>The chip launched in March and clocked at 3.0GHz with a singular high-performance core.</li><li>Rumors add that the Phone 3 could also see a price increase in India, which could affect the U.S. market.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It hasn&apos;t been too long since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> hit the market, and rumors are beginning to swirl regarding Nothing&apos;s next flagship device, the Phone 3. </p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hindi/nothing-phone-3-processor-details-leak-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a> (Hindu), the Nothing Phone 3 will supposedly feature Qualcomm&apos;s latest SoC variant, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/nothing-phone-3-rumored-to-pack-a-performance-punch-with-a-price-bump_id156858">PhoneArena</a>). The post adds that an industry official closer to the matter confirmed as much, alongside a claim that the device will rise in price — for one market, at least.</p><p>The source alleged that the Phone 3 will see a price of ₹40,000 to ₹45,000 when it launches in India. A rough estimate sees the device priced anywhere from $480 to nearly $540 in the U.S. if the rumors prove true. Rumors add that Nothing is "not interested" in pursuing the premium market of smartphones.</p><p>Apparently, the company wants to strike a balance between budget and premium without asking consumers for too much.</p><p>Pricing is always an object of curiosity, and, as PhoneArena noted, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> launched with a $600 price tag in 2023. If Nothing is considering a price hike in India, perhaps we&apos;d see the same in the U.S. For now, it&apos;s speculated that the device could see a nearly $100 increase in the US if these rumors are correct.</p><p>Regarding its chip, Qualcomm debuted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, which turned out to be a toned-down variant of the flagship SD 8 Gen 3. The chip clocked in at 3.0GHz alongside a singular high-performance core, slightly slower than its larger sibling&apos;s 3.3GHz max speed. The company stated the chip was designed to take on on-device AI features, similar to the beefier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>.</p><p>The announcement stated the chip features Quad HD Plus display support at 144Hz refresh rate, HDR10/10+ support, and more.</p><p>More information about the Nothing Phone 3 is scarce for now. The Nothing Phone 2 launched with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-processor-revealed">Carl Pei stated</a> he felt more comfortable with its tried-and-true capabilities over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Consumers were met with a 6.7-inch display and a maximum 512GB internal storage size.</p><p>Moreover, the Phone 2 launched last summer, which means teasers for the Phone 3 could start soon. The company started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-summer-2023-launch-teaser">teasing the Phone 2 in May</a>, meaning it may take a similar approach this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the things that I love about foldable phones is that I can use them for everything from playing games to getting work done or trying to force myself to read a book. The versatility offered by foldable phones is also one of the biggest hindrances, as I&apos;m easily distracted, so I&apos;ll start reading something and then a notification will come in and I&apos;ll end up forgetting what I was doing.</p><p>That&apos;s just one of the problems that I&apos;ve been attempting to solve with the Onyx Boox Page, a 7-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablet</a> with access to the Play Store. However, the journey of making this my go-to reading device has proven to be more of an adventure than I thought.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Z6yDu96c889S3TefmW4ASG" name="onyx-boox-page-ac-home-page.jpg" alt="Android Central in E Ink Bro app on Onyx Boox Page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z6yDu96c889S3TefmW4ASG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The problems first arose as soon as I took the Page out of the box and started trying to get everything set up. For one reason or another, it just would not connect to my home Wi-Fi network. I tried everything I could think of before stumbling across others who had the same problem.</p><p>It seems that if you have your network set up to use both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, some devices just won&apos;t connect, including the Page. Thankfully, I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tp-link-deco-x90-review">TP-Link Deco X90</a>, so all I had to do was quickly set up a guest network that only uses 2.4GHz. After getting the Page connected, it was pretty much smooth sailing. I was even able to switch back to my primary network after installing a software update.</p><p>Considering that the Boox Page is the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-leaf-2-review">Boox Leaf 2</a> that I&apos;ve already reviewed, I&apos;m already pretty familiar with the form factor and what to expect. One of the nice things, however, is that unlike the Leaf 2, I didn&apos;t need to jump through a bunch of hoops to get the Play Store installed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2366px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CTA32nFXmmxpgqFKL5aTaL" name="onyx-boox-page-play-store.jpg" alt="Google Play Store on the Onyx Boox Page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CTA32nFXmmxpgqFKL5aTaL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2366" height="1331" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Within minutes, I had the Kindle and Play Books apps installed, giving me access to my library of e-books, all without needing to fiddle around or worry about being limited to what&apos;s available in Onyx&apos;s own Boox Store. While Onyx packs its store full of free books, you won&apos;t find anything recent on tap. It&apos;s still kind of frustrating, but I guess it&apos;s there if you&apos;re really trying to avoid using either Google or Amazon&apos;s digital storefronts.</p><p>Now that everything was set up and I got signed into the apps I installed, the reading experience with the Boox Page is just what I expected. The backlit screen is nice, automatically adjusting based on the light around me. Onyx has also done a great job of providing plenty of settings to adjust and tinker with how the screen looks and operates.</p><p>Unlike trying to use something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, the 7-inch Boox Page is lightweight and comfortable to hold. Sure, it might not fold up for me to throw it in my front pocket, but it&apos;s an e-reader, not a phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kt8M6WVkNpoHitfKLEyqMP" name="onyx-boox-page-oneplus-open.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open next to Onyx Boox Page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kt8M6WVkNpoHitfKLEyqMP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the rest of the hardware, this is about as solid of a build as it comes, despite being made from a combination of glass and plastic. I actually had to double-check the official specs just to make sure that this wasn&apos;t aluminum because that&apos;s how good it feels.</p><p>Much like its predecessor, the Boox Page also has the added benefit of offering dual page-turning buttons on the front. These work as you&apos;d expect, but there&apos;s a bit of a twist. If you dive into the Settings app, you can customize how the buttons work in other apps.</p><p>By default, any non-reading apps will just adjust the volume up or down. However, I replaced that shortcut with "Scrolling" whenever I&apos;m browsing the web in EInkBro or catching up on my reading list in Instapaper. Onyx even includes long-press shortcuts, which come in quite handy as I can manually invoke the screen refresh functionality or pull up the E Ink Center to change settings on the fly. I still keep the "NaviBall" enabled, but it&apos;s often just minimized and moved out of my way unless I need it in a pinch for something else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Hupr6iHLZCLg7drFbWwr5K" name="onyx-boox-page-button-settings.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Page button settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hupr6iHLZCLg7drFbWwr5K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of reading books, browsing the web, or catching up on your reading list, you&apos;re not really going to venture outside the world of words. That means when it comes to watching videos, you&apos;re better off just grabbing your phone. It&apos;s really not worth trying to torture yourself even if you enjoy using the Boox Page that much.</p><p>The same sentiment rings true for games outside of maybe Wordle, Sudoku, or a crossword puzzle. Just for fun, I wanted to see what the experience would be like when loading up the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-wallpaper-watch-faces-songs">Legend of Zelda for NES</a>. Surprisingly, it didn&apos;t look as bad as I thought it would, and I didn&apos;t even need to manually refresh the screen all that often.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ewVNpUZEfUXdvqNsfuXdkQ" name="onyx-boox-page-zelda.jpg" alt="Zelda for NES on the Onyx Boox Page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ewVNpUZEfUXdvqNsfuXdkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I did need to do is pair a controller with the Boox Page because it&apos;s almost impossible to see the on-screen controls with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-emulate-nes-snes-and-nintendo-ds-android">NES emulator</a> I was using. But again, this isn&apos;t the intended use case, so I don&apos;t really recommend any gaming or watching videos here.</p><p>Parlor tricks aside, I really do enjoy the Boox Page and what it offers as not just an e-reader but also as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablet</a>. It&apos;s not cumbersome to hold and use, even with one hand, and the buttons on the front are a nice inclusion. I haven&apos;t really mentioned battery life because, frankly, it&apos;s been just as good as one would hope. The Page is always ready for me to pick up where I left off, and I haven&apos;t encountered any issues that I can remember.</p><p>The elephant in the room, however, is the price. Amazon no longer sells the Oasis, which would be the most comparable model given that it, too, featured page-turning buttons. With that in mind, the Page and its $249 retail price is just $5 less than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle Scribe</a> but is much smaller, lacks an IP rating, and doesn&apos;t offer stylus compatibility.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bSpoU9CQg9eoauH4ezvRxE" name="onyx-boox-page-outside-in-hand.jpg" alt="Holding the Onyx Boox Page outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSpoU9CQg9eoauH4ezvRxE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, thanks to the inclusion of the Play Store, you&apos;re not limited to only using Amazon&apos;s Kindle app to read your books. Even still, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> priced at $190, the added functionality might not be enough to justify the additional $60 for some.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth mentioning that Onyx doesn&apos;t have the greatest track record with software support. Occasionally, you&apos;ll see a random update come through that might fix some bugs or add a few features. But don&apos;t expect to see one arrive with Android 12 in tow, let alone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. It&apos;s really fine for the time being, but with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> around the corner, it&apos;s a bit of a let-down. Then again, it&apos;s an e-reader, first and foremost, and until the Play Books or Kindle apps stop supporting Android 11, it really won&apos;t be much of an issue.</p><p>That all being said, I really do like what Onyx is doing with its various e-readers and E Ink tablets. There are enough features to help differentiate these from much of the competition. As for the Boox Page, if you&apos;re willing to make a few concessions, it&apos;s definitely worth every penny.</p>

<hr>
<p>A Samsung executive has teased that there&apos;s more generative AI on the horizon for its assistant Bixby.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/samsung-says-it-could-upgrade-bixby-with-generative-ai-.html">CNBC</a>, a Samsung executive told the publication that the company is interested in bringing more generative AI power to Bixby. It seems as though Samsung is looking hard at OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT as the inspiration behind what&apos;s to come to Bixby.</p><p>Won-joon Choi, executive vice president of Samsung’s mobile business said, "with the emergence of generative AI and LLM (large language model) technology, I believe that we have to redefine the role of the Bixby, so that Bixby could be equipped with generative AI and become more smarter in the future."</p><p>Choi added this new AI software would help users engage in more "natural conversations" with Bixby moving forward. Samsung reiterates the importance of Bixby, stating it is a "key voice assistant" across its Galaxy phones, TVs, and digital appliances.</p><p>In terms of what to expect, Won-joon Choi did not explicitly state what sort of features are on the way. Choi states Samsung is "working so hard" to make things happen. As the publication notes, ChatGPT can help users draft pieces of text, generate images, and offer video responses to queries.</p>

<p>Samsung is almost certainly playing catch-up in the generative AI department as ChatGPT and Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Gemini</a> have cemented their place. Gemini is Google&apos;s most powerful LLM and it&apos;s been busy bringing it to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">entire Pixel 8 series</a>, as of late.</p><p>But Samsung isn&apos;t starting from zero, as the company brought some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-bixby-integration-announced">AI enhancements</a> to its old chatbot, courtesy of Galaxy AI. In February, the company announced the rollout of several Galaxy AI features such as Live Translate, Spelling Correction, Webpage Summaries, and more for Bixby. The announcement stated the purpose was to enable "easy and seamless" usability for Samsung&apos;s AI features.</p><p>Now, users with a Galaxy S24 series device can leverage Galaxy AI influence hands-free with their voices.</p><p>Most recently, Samsung rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">One UI 6.1 update</a> for a few eligible past-gen devices, which included Galaxy AI features.</p>

<p>Sonic writes:</p><p><em><strong>If I were to do a factory reset on my phone, would my phone number still be on it?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>The answer for this one is ... maybe. </p><p>Your phone number and all account information for your phone carrier are stored on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-prepaid-sim-cards-us-travelers-and-tourists">SIM card</a> (subscriber identity module). Normally, this is a small removable card that goes into a special tray in the body of your phone. A factory reset doesn&apos;t affect this, and as soon as your phone restarts, everything is set back up.</p><p>However, isn&apos;t the case if you use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIM</a>. You&apos;ll need to set it up again through your carrier after you&apos;ve finished setting up your phone. Either way, the data isn&apos;t lost and your number won&apos;t change.</p>
<p>This brings up another important thing to know — what <em>does</em> survive when you reset your phone? </p><p>When you perform a factory reset on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, all user data is effectively wiped away. This means app data, photos, music, videos, and what&apos;s in the download folder. The data on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">SD card</a> will remain, but much of it may be inaccessible. You&apos;ll need to set up your phone just like you did when you first got it, and it will be just as empty.</p>
<p>It&apos;s worth noting that a very determined person with plenty of time and the right tools may be able to access remnants of data after a reset, but unless you have something really valuable stored it&apos;s just not worth the effort to try and sort through it all and try to decrypt it all. </p><p>Not everything is gone, though, because a lot of what we see on our phones is tied to our Google accounts (or Apple ID if you&apos;re an iPhone user).</p>
<h2 id="your-google-account-2">Your Google account</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfqijoTHMDheu3SZYLbNnc" name="Google-Photos-magic-editor.jpg" alt="Google Photos magic eraser tool being shown on the stage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfqijoTHMDheu3SZYLbNnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google provides storage for a lot of your data in its cloud. Your email, calendar, contacts, photos, music, and even app data can be stored, and once you&apos;ve signed back in with your account, it can be synchronized back to your phone — even after it&apos;s been reset.</p><p>Some phones store even more — on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel</a>, things like your home screen wallpaper and Wi-Fi networks are saved, and some companies like Samsung save even more data about how your phone was set up. You can import this during the setup process if you want things to go back to where they were.</p>
<p>It&apos;s also worth noting that all of your app data could be backed up, too, including game progress. Your paid apps and in-app purchases will be saved every time, but Google offers space for every Android user that stores data for each installed app, and it&apos;s free.</p><p>Unless you go looking for it, you won&apos;t know it&apos;s there, but a developer can write code into their apps so it uses this space, and all of your app data will be restored when you reinstall an app.</p>
<p>What you need to do is make sure things are being backed up. For mundane things like contacts and your calendar data, this just happens. But you&apos;ll need to make sure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> is set up if you want a backup of your photos and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> will store paid music and playlists under your account.</p><p>Other companies offer similar services; Amazon comes to mind as a company that offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-music">cloud storage for music</a> and photos. If you would rather use one of these services, make sure it&apos;s set up so that backups happen regularly and automatically, and you should be golden.</p>
<p>Finally, know that wiping one device on your account does not affect any others. You might use the same Google account on a phone and a tablet or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> — erasing one of them doesn&apos;t touch the other.</p><p>Resetting a phone is a pain, but thanks to the cloud, it&apos;s a little easier than it used to be.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus finally unveiled its new mid-range smartphone for the Indian market, putting an end to multiple leaks, and introduced the OnePlus Nord CE 4.</p><p>The latest Nord phone is a successor to the Nord CE 3 with a new design; unlike the predecessor, it equips a new camera visor and appears to have more rounded corners this time. The device features two colorways, notably Dark Chrome and Celadon Marble, quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-marble-odyssey-hands-on">Marble Odyssey</a> version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a>.</p>

<p>The device sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with Full HD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Other parameters include support for HDR10+ and the Aqua Touch feature, which should help users use the display with wet hands or, in such situations, hassle-free.</p><p>Underneath, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 is powered by Qualcomm’s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a> coupled with Adreno 720 GPU — a mid-range SoC aimed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheaper Android phones</a> that promises effortless multitasking alongside power efficiency. </p><p>It further features up to 8GB of RAM (LPDDR4X) and 256GB of onboard storage (UFS 3.1). The RAM is additionally expandable via virtual RAM with expansion options including 4/6/8GB.</p><p>The Nord CE 4 has a large 5500mAh battery capacity, with 100W SuperVOOC charging support, and promises to juice up the battery to full in less than half an hour. The device is set to come with an Android 14-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-android-14-hands-on">OxygenOS 14</a>. </p>

<p>It&apos;s packed with a 50MP Sony LYT-600 with OIS as the primary sensor, aided by an 8MP ultra-wide lens (Sony IMX355). For video, the rear camera supports up to 4K at 30fps. On the front, the punch hole hosts a 16MP selfie shooter supporting EIS.</p><p>The other highlights of the Nord CE 4 handset include a dual stereo speaker setup, support for microSD for expandable storage, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 6, and 5G. </p><p>When it comes to pricing, the 8GB+128GB storage variant costs Rs 24,999 (~$300), and the larger 8GB RAM and 256GB storage retails at Rs 26,999 (~$324). The company is putting the device for sale starting on April 4, and users who reserve it on the same day will get the OnePlus Nord Buds 2r for free as part of the launch.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OnePlus is a major player in the Indian smartphone market, offering a wide range of devices, from flagships to midrange phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/nord-ce4-5g?from=ribbon">new Nord CE 4</a>. However, the picture across North America looks quite different and, in its current state, a bit unclear. With a limited selection of phones available and the lack of major carrier support, it remains to be seen how the company will retain its identity in a smartphone market dominated by Samsung and even smaller players like Motorola.</p><p>OnePlus&apos; journey in the U.S. has been a tale of unexpected events. The company recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> in North America, a higher-mid-range phone from the company&apos;s R-series, a line that previously wasn&apos;t sold in the U.S. That said, a certain strategic shift brought the phone to the table. Over time, the company’s strategy has continued to evolve based on its target audience, and its offerings have expanded with its first Wear OS smartwatch, a high-end foldable, and its first tablet.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-apos-flexible-strategy-2">OnePlus&apos; flexible strategy</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, the company marketed itself as a global brand instead of a China-based brand. It was known as a ‘Flagship killer,’ offering phones with high-end features at a lower price than established giants like Samsung and Apple. More recently, it pivoted to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/oneplus-announces-14x-strategy-oneplus-11-launch/">1+4=X strategy</a>, focusing on a single flagship phone offering premium features in its design, display, camera, and battery while expanding into a variety of other products like wearables and smart TVs.</p><p>“OnePlus is a young and nimble player in the market and understands the need to remain flexible and address market needs,” said Maurice Klaehne, senior research analyst at Counterpoint Research. </p><p>As such, OnePlus has decided to rebrand itself as an “ecosystem builder,” offering a range of devices beyond phones, like the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch-2-one-week-challenge">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-pad-rumored-launch-schedule-india">OnePlus Tablet.</a></p><p>Anshel Sag, a senior analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that OnePlus wants to offer a “halo” effect “with a healthy family of affordable devices like the 12R and Nord series. They are also building an ecosystem of products like the smartwatch and tablet around the phone leadership experience.”</p>

<p>Unlike other Chinese phone brands that are often pitted against each other, OnePlus wanted to create a significant presence as a global phone manufacturer.</p><p>It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/india-smartphone-share/#:~:text=OnePlus%20was%20the%20fastest%20growing,smartphone%20market%20in%20Q2%202023.&text=*Ranking%20is%20according%20to%20the%20latest%20quarter.,-India%20Smartphone%20Shipments">succeeded</a> in India, becoming the fastest-growing smartphone brand in 2023, with 68% YoY growth. Sag attributed OnePlus’s success in India to its strong community and brand recognition. </p><p>The U.S., however, was a tougher shell to crack “because it requires a lot more marketing dollars as well as carrier involvement, and just certifying on carriers isn’t enough, even though it is expensive,” Sag added. Cellular carriers rule the smartphone market in the U.S., and most people rely on these carriers to get new devices every year. Only in 2018 did OnePlus partner with T-Mobile to launch one of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.gsmarena.com/oneplus_6t_86_percent_jump_us_sales-news-34169.php">best-selling devices</a>, the OnePlus 6T. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Selling a phone in the United States requires a huge marketing push and deep carrier involvement, which can be expensive.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>OnePlus kept up its partnership with T-Mobile for some time, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7-pro-too-big-phone">OnePlus 7 Pro</a> and other devices being exclusive to the carrier. However, the partnership hit a rocky patch when the OEM decided not to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> on T-Mobile and instead sell the flagship phones unlocked via retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. It is speculated that there were disagreements surrounding device timelines and that T-Mobile wanted to keep phones on its shelves longer than OnePlus was willing to. It also had a brief gig with Verizon in 2020, but that also ended swiftly. </p><p>While its flagship phones didn’t seem to make much headway in the U.S. market, the company introduced its budget-focused Nord N series phones. OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-samsung-budget-new-strategy">benefited</a> from its carrier partnership with T-Mobile and the introduction of the Nord N10, N100, and N200 5G back in 2021, followed by newer devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n300-5g-review">Nord N300 5G</a> in 2022. However, as of now, only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> is offered through the carrier, meaning consumers will have to go elsewhere for other OnePlus models.</p><p>When we compare the Indian OnePlus website to that of the North American one, there’s an obvious difference. In India, the company offers a selection of five flagship phones and three Nord series phones. At the same time, the U.S. website sees slim picking with only a total of four phones: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and 12R, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, and the Nord N30.</p>

<p>Despite the slim offerings, the company is working to make its phones more enticing against heavy hitters, notes Klaehne. “Nevertheless, the company is offering big discounts on its devices through the OnePlus store and other outlets through a trade-in program, which has been a great way to entice customers.”</p><p>A spokesperson from OnePlus told Android Central that the company “tailors its product portfolio based on different consumer demands in the various regions.” With the U.S. market dominated by premium players like Samsung and Apple, it’s clear OnePlus wants a piece of that pie. Meanwhile, OnePlus refused to comment on how the sub-flagship 12R was fairing in North America, although it’s still quite early.</p>
<h2 id="future-of-oneplus-in-the-us-2">Future of OnePlus in the US</h2>
<p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottkramer/2023/07/31/5-minutes-with-oneplus-na-ceo-robin-liu/?sh=450fe2a37fe9">interview</a> with Forbes in 2023, OnePlus’s North American CEO, Robin Liu, said that the company’s mission is to focus on products that give customers the best experience. “We are also targeting a different audience—spreading our brand awareness to more users. It will take some time because it costs a lot (of money and effort). We’re also working together with our retail partners to expand our products to a larger audience.”</p><p>Whether or not OnePlus will succeed in making a dent in the North American market remains up in the air. Still, according to the company, it will continue to bring “high-end flagship smartphone devices to the North American market at an affordable and competitive price point.”</p><p>Sag reiterated that the Chinese OEMs have the hardest time getting into the market, which is the biggest challenge he sees for OnePlus. This perception may still affect OnePlus in the U.S. as tensions continue to affect relationships. “Huawei is the first and foremost. You don’t see a lot of TCL or ZTE anymore, and it’s the same with Oneplus.”</p><p>Klaehne points out that if OnePlus can also enter other markets, OPPO will have a harder time entering.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/us-smartphone-market-q4-2023/#:~:text=US%20smartphone%20shipments%20grew%208,Counterpoint%20Research&apos;s%20Market%20Monitor%20data">Data from Q4 2023</a> shows that while Samsung and Motorola held 18% and 8% of the U.S. market, respectively, OnePlus remained relegated to the ‘other’ category of phones, which contributes to 8% of overall sales. For context, TCL and Google managed to squeeze 1% and 2% of the market, respectively.</p>

<p>The dominance of Apple, Samsung, and, to an extent, Motorola/Google in the U.S. market has been challenging for OnePlus in the carrier market, especially with limited mindshare here compared to other regions. The U.S. market is hard to penetrate as it’s so carrier-dominated, margins are low, and carriers often have specific requirements for SKUs and specs. However, Klaehne suggests that OnePlus still has what it takes to be successful in North America, provided it sticks to what it does best.</p><p>“For continued success, OnePlus should focus on its ecosystem approach and provide consumers with a strong value proposition combined with clear messaging and cohesive product line.”</p>
