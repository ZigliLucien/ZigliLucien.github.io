                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The default cloth Quest 3 facial interface is pretty comfortable, but it has a few obvious flaws. AMVR&apos;s facial interface replacement fixes nearly all of those by using an easy-to-clean and replace PU leather pad, vents to eliminate lens fog, and even a built-in glasses spacer like the default Quest 3 face pad has.</p><p>AMVR was one of the first companies to deliver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> accessories after the headset launched in October 2023. Surprisingly, the company&apos;s offerings are still among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> despite other companies having longer development times.</p><p>The AMVR facial interface replacement for Meta Quest 3 ships with two main parts: the pad and the facial interface adapter. The adapter itself is plastic and slots right into the headset in the same way the default pad does. Unlike the default pad, however, AMVR&apos;s solution separates the pad from the spacer to make things more convenient.</p>

<p>The adapter is lined with brilliantly designed vents that keep light from entering the headset, yet somehow allow moisture and heat to escape. That last part is crucial for preventing lens fog. I&apos;ve had a few instances where the corners of the lenses would still fog in the first few minutes of play, but haven&apos;t had the Quest 3&apos;s lenses completely fog up with this facial interface as they do with the default pad.</p><p>AMVR uses a similar built-in glasses spacer solution to Meta&apos;s, with three preset spacing options and prongs that keep the interface locked into place. I found these were a little hard to adjust since the adapter uses four anchor points, and I often had to readjust the spacing after plugging the adapter into the Quest 3 headset.</p>

<p>The front of the adapter is lined with Velcro-style hooks that fit nicely with nearly every facial interface pad I own. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-face-covers">best Quest 2 facial interface</a> pads fit on AMVR&apos;s design, meaning you won&apos;t need to buy a bunch of new pads if you already won a Quest 2, along with some Velcro-backed face pads.</p><p>That makes it easy to remove the pads and clean them after use. It&apos;s also simple to swap them out when needed, which is handy for when you&apos;ve got friends or family over and want to keep them feeling clean by using separate face pads.</p><p>The biggest regular annoyance with this design is the nose seal. It&apos;s barely held on with one small prong on each side of the floppy seal and easily comes undone when changing out the face pad. It&apos;s also annoying to try to push it back into place, but it does such a great job of blocking out light that I find myself going through the hassle of getting it back on when it falls off.</p><p>Overall, this is the best facial interface replacement you&apos;ll find on the Meta Quest 3 today. A tighter nose seal and adjusted glasses spacer design would make it perfect, but neither problem is big enough to complain about much.</p>

<hr>
<p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/apple-in-talks-to-license-google-gemini-for-iphone-ios-18-generative-ai-tools?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> report, Apple is beginning to work with Google as it looks to integrate Gemini into the foundation of its iPhone software. According to sources close to the matter, Gemini&apos;s array of models would be integrated into Apple&apos;s generative AI features that it&apos;s currently developing for the iPhone.</p><p>These new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Gemini-backed</a> capabilities will reportedly be available for Apple&apos;s iOS 18 software, which should land on iPhones later in 2024. The publication adds that the "enhancements" would further enhance Apple&apos;s intent to create on-device Gen AI features.</p><p>Such offerings would include AI-based image creation and "writing essays based on simple prompts."</p><p>The report adds that Apple had been testing its own LLM (large language model) since "early last year" dubbed "Ajax." The company has also tested its own AI chatbot called "Apple GPT," but sources claim the software has remained "inferior" to Google&apos;s. Additionally, sources state Apple had once entered talks with OpenAI about using its software, but it appears it will lean toward Google.</p><p>As Bloomberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-04/apple-s-tim-cook-says-ai-concerns-still-need-to-be-sorted-out">noted</a>, Apple&apos;s CEO Tim Cook has utilized OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT previously but stated that "a number of issues need to be sorted." Cook will also look to implement Apple&apos;s version of AI features onto the iPhone on a "very thoughtful basis."</p><p>With such AI possibilities seemingly in line for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18-is-reportedly-out-in-the-wild-ahead-of-wwdc-reveal">iOS 18</a>, it&apos;s speculated that a formal announcement could happen in June at the earliest during WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference).</p><p>Android Central has contacted Apple and Google for comment about their rumored AI partnership but has not heard back in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>Apple is potentially looking to work with Google for AI, which makes sense, as Android Central&apos;s Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-apple-can-learn-about-ai">once suggested</a> that "if the company execs don&apos;t want to shell out a few of its billions on R&D or hire people who already know how it&apos;s done, it could simply partner with Google or another company in the same way Samsung has done and let the heavy lifting happen in Mountain View or elsewhere."</p><p>While it seems Apple may put more faith in Google&apos;s Gemini model, Cook&apos;s comment about problems with AI should extend to its potential partner, too. Google disabled Gemini&apos;s ability to create images based on user prompts in February <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-ai-image-generation-disabled">following severe backlash</a>. Users discovered that the bot was quite inaccurate when given a prompt regarding historical groups of people.</p><p>Meanwhile, it remains to be seen what more a Google-Apple AI partnership could bring feature-wise. The former introduced its new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>" capability, which arrived on the Galaxy S24 series earlier this year. Users could utilize an array of touch gestures to highlight specific items in images for a search through Google&apos;s engine.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/unfunyguy/status/1767967529191055505">@unfunyguy writes</a>:</p><p><em><strong>I haven&apos;t updated the Google Partner Setup app since it appeared on the Play Store should I do it?</strong></em></p>
<p>The best and worst part about having a smartphone are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">the apps</a>. The right ones can entertain us, help keep us organized, and do all sorts of useful things that make life a little easier. The bad ones track what we do or worse. Somehow, we have to know the difference.</p><p>It can be tough because sometimes an app is both good and bad. Remember that a free app isn&apos;t free; you&apos;re just not spending money. You&apos;re paying with an alternative currency in the form of data a company finds useful.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the kind of app Google Partner Setup is. It&apos;s part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">Google Mobile Services</a> suite of software that companies like Samsung use under license from Google and not part of Android itself. It&apos;s not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">open source</a>, so nobody outside of Google can take a peek under the hood to see exactly what it does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iGsrZ4yTQT8YXCFPJqyoKb" name="Motorola-edge-2022-t-mobile-apps.jpg" alt="Pre-installed T-Mobile apps on the Motorola Edge (2022)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGsrZ4yTQT8YXCFPJqyoKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Officially, the Google Partner Setup app is a helper application for proper device functionality. The company that made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> installed it into the system software. </p><p>It does things like help connect apps to Google services or help vendors troubleshoot software issues. It&apos;s important to realize it&apos;s not the same as Google Partners for ads or Play Games even though they have a similar name. It&apos;s on the Play Store because the app has been broken out of the system for easier updating.</p>
<p>Most say this is a required application, and you can&apos;t uninstall it. The truth is that It may not be required, and while you can&apos;t easily uninstall it, disabling it is simple. But unless you know what you&apos;re doing and are willing to reload the software on your phone, you probably shouldn&apos;t because it (potentially) does so many different things.</p><p>To answer your question, <strong>I recommend you update the app</strong>. I&apos;d never purposefully run an older version of any system application on my phone unless I could be 100% certain of what the app does. But this brings focus to the real issue — there are apps on our phones that we don&apos;t know the purpose of.</p>

<p>Android is like any other operating system and is chock full of executable programs that make it work. The software powering an iPhone, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>, or any other laptop or tablet is the same way.</p><p>It&apos;s tempting to disable or uninstall some of these programs sometimes, privacy and performance being the two biggest reasons. Often, it works, and everything acts normally without all the pieces. Sometimes it doesn&apos;t work. When a new version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-apps-windows-11">Microsoft Windows</a> comes out, you&apos;ll see a lot of talk about this, and it takes a while for folks to determine what&apos;s safe to get rid of and what&apos;s not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my best advice is to leave things alone. If you&apos;re looking to an article like this for advice, you probably don&apos;t have the means or the background to determine exactly what removing or disabling an app does. Even worse, disabling the wrong app means you&apos;ve borked the software on your phone and won&apos;t be able to undo it.</p><p>If you&apos;re determined, at least spend plenty of time searching to find out what an app is, what it does, and what may happen if you disable or uninstall it. Remember, 99% of the time spent modding the software on your phone should be spent reading and reading.</p>

<hr>
<p>A few leaks have surfaced regarding Vivo&apos;s upcoming X Fold 3 series and its potential launch date later in March.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/03/14/vivo-x-fold-3-series-launch-date-in-china-seemingly-revealed/">Gizmochina</a>, a post on Weibo has seemingly spilled Vivo&apos;s plans to debut the X Fold 3 series on March 26 at 5 PM local time in China. More importantly, the series is expected to feature a Pro model and a standard, which may feature a 6.5-inch cover display and an 8-inch internal screen. The series may also be released with an in-display fingerprint reader.</p><p>Design-wise, rumors suggest the X Fold 3 series will offer a "thin profile and tall exterior display." The circular camera housing on its rear panel is rumored to stay the same by delivering three Zeiss-branded camera lenses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold-2-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>A power boost may hit the X Fold 3 series as the leak purports consumers could see Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. More internal boosts could arrive in the form of a maximum of 16GB RAM and 1TB of internal storage space.</p><p>Speculation suggests the battery is where the series differs, with the X Fold 3 Pro potentially featuring a 5,800mAh battery while the base model contains a 5,500mAh version. Each phone is rumored to support 120W wired and 50W wireless charging.</p>

<p>The recent rumors double down on a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold-3-pro-specs-leak">we&apos;ve heard previously</a> about Vivo&apos;s upcoming foldable series. The X Fold 3 series appears ready to take on some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a>, as past leaks said it would feature LTPO AMOLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate. The series was also rumored to feature a 50MP main camera, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 64MP periscope lens with 3x zoom.</p><p>The rumored camera strengths would give the X Fold 3 series quite the leg up over its predecessor as that device offered a 50MP, 12MP, and 12MP triple camera setup.</p><p>With Vivo&apos;s next launch rumored to arrive in a week, the device will likely provide OriginOS 4 (Android 14) out of the box. Additionally, it looks like consumers will be treated to a white colorway.</p>

<p>There are a lot of great smartphones to choose from nowadays, and, comparing the OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro shows how difficult a decision can be. While there are a few similarities between these two devices, both OnePlus and Google offer a bit of "flair" to help each phone stand out from the pack.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-12-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-design-2">OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK" name="oneplus-12-31.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 next to OnePlus 9, OnePlus 10, and OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both of these devices stay true to their predecessors in terms of the overall design. They also offer unique and distinct camera layouts as Google has stuck with the "visor" with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> utilizes essentially the same rounded camera cutout as the OnePlus 11.</p><p>Where the Pixel 8 Pro might appeal more to some is in the display. Google is finally using a flat panel, as opposed to the curved screen from previous models. The display of the OnePlus 12 remains largely unchanged, as there are slight curves on either side. This makes it one of the few remaining flagships to feature a curved panel, as Google, Samsung, and others are moving back to flat screens.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-12-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2WyfCGhDf6xUMQs2TVo8AH" name="oneplus-12-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 about page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WyfCGhDf6xUMQs2TVo8AH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>LTPO OLED seems to be the display type that many companies are implementing, and that rings true for OnePlus and Google. With the OnePlus 12, you&apos;ll enjoy a 6.82-inch display, sporting a 3168 x 1440 resolution, and a 120Hz variable refresh rate. As for the Pixel 8 Pro, we have a 6.7-inch panel, with a 2992 x 1344 resolution, and the same 120Hz variable refresh rate.</p><p>However, where the OnePlus 12 pulls away is in the peak brightness of its display. Both of these devices provide 1,600 nits of brightness in normal conditions, but the OnePlus 12 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">can max out at 4,500 nits</a>. This is a massive improvement over the 2,400 nits of peak brightness offered by the Pixel 8 Pro. What this boils down to is that you&apos;ll have a far easier time using your OnePlus 12 while out and about, compared to Google&apos;s offering.</p>

<p>When it comes to "horsepower" it won&apos;t take long to see that the OnePlus 12 arguably offers a more performant package. It&apos;s powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, the same chip found in many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released so far. This is paired with either 12GB or 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, along with 256GB or 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4LtysQQJuZboJ7uTZcoMVk" name="meta-quest-3-google-play-store-01.jpg" alt="The Google Play Store on a Google Pixel 8 Pro in front of a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4LtysQQJuZboJ7uTZcoMVk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are the latest devices to be powered by Google&apos;s in-house SoC. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> ends up being slightly more performant compared to the G2, but offers much-improved power efficiency. Like the OnePlus 12, the Pixel 8 Pro features 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM but comes with more storage configurations, ranging from 128GB all the way up to 1TB.</p><p>Comparing battery life introduces another interesting comparison. The OnePlus 12 has a larger 5,400mAh cell, while the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s 5,050mAh battery gets the job done. However, OnePlus has implemented 100W SuperVOOC wired charging and 50W wireless charging into the OnePlus 12. It&apos;s not even a fair comparison, to be frank, as the Pixel 8 Pro maxes out at 30W or 23W, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-12-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-software-and-more-2">OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Software and more</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GQuLExZPqtGpS8pSMajC7J" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-call-ai-wallpaper-03.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro AI wallpaper generation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GQuLExZPqtGpS8pSMajC7J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there&apos;s such a thing as an "Achilles heel" with the OnePlus 12, it&apos;s the software. Long gone are the days when OxygenOS was exciting and tuned to the user, as the company has merged it with ColorOS. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-interview-gary-chen-zach-lin">current state of OxygenOS</a> is much better than when this adventure originally began, but it still might not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea.</p><p>On the flip side, Google&apos;s "Pixel experience" remains largely the same compared to previous iterations. Material Design is still widely prevalent if you want it, and everything just kind of <em>works</em> without needing to fiddle too much. However, OxygenOS has a definite edge when it comes to various features such as the larger folder windows, and the ability to use icon packs without relying on a third-party launcher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZSBbyXa2fr85A8HhnTMctY" name="oneplus-12-customization.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 customization page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZSBbyXa2fr85A8HhnTMctY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of aesthetics, Google has an edge in terms of how long it claims to be supporting the Pixel 8 Pro. The company announced that both of its most recent devices will receive up to seven years of software updates. Meanwhile, OnePlus has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-president-throws-shade-at-seven-years-of-updates">steadfast</a> in sticking with four years of major OS upgrades, and five years of security patches.</p><p>We don&apos;t know what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">the state of the software</a> will look like in seven years, so you&apos;ll have to take Google&apos;s announcement with a grain of salt. But, at least on paper, it&apos;s refreshing to see Google finally fall in line with Samsung when it comes to the longevity of software support.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G6sYDy7nJGY5qbZ43aGV9G" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-call-screening-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro call screening" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G6sYDy7nJGY5qbZ43aGV9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of that even mentions the various AI enhancements and features that were announced and are still coming to the Pixel 8 Pro. Since launch, the Pixel 8 Pro has received "Summarize in Recorder," Smart Reply in Gboard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>. Not to mention seeing improvements to staple features such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-lens-google-photos">Google Lens</a>, Live Translate, and Pixel Call Assist.</p><p>The OnePlus 12 fails to offer any similar features or functionality to compete on the AI landscape. However, that might change in the future, as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-12-receives-new-ai-features" target="_blank">recent update</a> to the Chinese variant brought "AI Summarizer," "AI GC Remover," and "Article summaries" to the OnePlus 12. Unfortunately, we aren&apos;t sure whether these features or any others, will make their way to the OnePlus 12 in other regions.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-12-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-cameras-2">OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Voi5uZ3EobJ55VwS8eGBNE" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-camera-viewfinder-01.jpg" alt="The redesigned camera UI on the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Voi5uZ3EobJ55VwS8eGBNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re interested to see if OnePlus has finally managed to compete with the likes of the Pixel 8 Pro, then you&apos;re in luck. Both of these devices sport a triple camera array on the back, headlined by a 50MP wide-angle lens, paired with a 48MP ultrawide sensor. As for zoom capabilities, the OnePlus 12 utilizes a 64MP telephoto lens capable of offering 3x optical zoom. The Pixel 8 Pro, uses a lower 48MP telephoto sensor but features an optical zoom of 5x.</p><p>Even when you take into account the software processing, the photos you take will be pleasant, regardless of which device. It really comes down to whether you prefer Google&apos;s processing and the ability to zoom in a little bit closer.</p>

<p>In our review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">Harish says</a> that the OnePlus 12 is "on par with the likes of the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 Pro." It&apos;s not until you start getting into the digital zoom territory that the cracks of the OnePlus 12&apos;s camera system really start to show.</p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, your pictures are still going to look fantastic, including photos shot in low light. But, Google <em>finally</em> listened to its users and implemented a Pro Mode, although it&apos;s currently only limited to the 8 Pro. Obviously, this is something that OnePlus, Samsung, and others have offered for years. But, it&apos;s nice to see that you can finally take control over the various settings when taking pictures without the use of third-party apps.</p>

<p>At this point, you wouldn&apos;t be "wrong" picking either the OnePlus 12 or Pixel 8 Pro. However, there&apos;s one more consideration to be made, and that&apos;s the price. The Pixel 8 Pro with 128GB of storage is priced at $999, moving up in increments depending on if you want more storage. The OnePlus 12 with its 256GB of storage comes in at just $799.</p><p>That&apos;s a $200 difference right off the bat and is actually $300 if you bump up the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s storage to match the OnePlus 12. It&apos;s really tough to argue in Google&apos;s favor here, even if it offers more in the way of AI features compared to OnePlus.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is a better overall chip, OnePlus seems to finally have nailed the camera tuning, and the 12 charges <em>much</em> faster than the Pixel. However, at the same time, you can get the Pixel 8 Pro from your local carrier or big box store. If you want the OnePlus 12, you won&apos;t be able to enjoy any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-oneplus-12-deals-of-the-month">carrier deals</a> and have to go through the likes of Best Buy, Amazon, or OnePlus directly.</p><p>If that&apos;s not something that concerns you, then I would suggest just going with the OnePlus 12. It&apos;s a much better value, while being more powerful, having a brighter display, and a larger battery. Plus, OxygenOS does continue to get better with time, even if it&apos;s still not quite on par with the Pixel in some areas.</p><p>However, those who <em>can</em> take advantage of various carrier and trade-in deals might just be better suited for the Pixel 8 Pro. We&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">plenty of deals</a> that knock hundreds off the price, so there&apos;s a good chance you can trade in your current phone and get the 8 Pro for the same cost.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm brings Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 with generative AI features.</li><li>It comes with one high-performance core with clock speeds at 3.0GHz.</li><li>The latest SoC-powered chipset will be first seen in OEMs, including Xiaomi, Realme, iQOO, Honor, and Redmi.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm has a new flagship-tier chipset dubbed Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, which the company announced will power some of the premium-tier flagships from OEMs like Honor, iQOO, Realme, Redmi, and Xiaomi.</p><p>The new chipset marks the first Snapdragon 8s series, previously seen in the 7 series portfolio, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a>.</p><p>According to Qualcomm, the new chipset sits between the latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>. The chipset comprises device-generative AI features, an always-sensing ISP, hyper-realistic mobile gaming, breakthrough connectivity, and lossless high-definition sound, notes Qualcomm in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/03/qualcomm-brings-the-best-of-on-device-ai-to-more-smartphones-wit">announcement post</a>.</p>

<p>The on-device generative AI features include Gen AI assistant, Gen AI image generation, and support for popular Large Language Models (LLM) like Baichuan-7B, Llama 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a>, and Zhipu ChatGLM.</p><p>Despite falling under the SD 8 Gen 3, the 8S Gen 3 borrows some of its features like 18-bit triple Cognitive ISP, photo expansion, Snapdragon LLV (Low Light Vision), 2x sHDR, and Qualcomm Aqstic Speaker Max technology. The latter promises to reduce distortion when music is played in higher volumes. The gaming-centric features involve Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing and Adreno Frame Motion Engine 2.</p>
<p>On the performance end, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 packs in one prime core CPU with promised clock speeds of up to 3.0GHz (a tad shorter than the 8 Gen 3, which sits at 3.3GHz). The octa-core CPU is further backed by four performance and three efficiency cores. The 5G-enabled chipset includes a Snapdragon X70 5G Modem-RF system — the same one seen on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p><p>Other notable features of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 include Quad HD Plus display support at 144Hz refresh rate, HDR10/10+ support, Quick Charge 5 technology, support for LPDDR5x memory, a UFS 4.0 interface, and USB 3.1 Gen 2.</p><p>Lastly, the aforementioned OEMs will likely bring their first-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> featuring the chipset in the coming months; however, Qualcomm notes that Xiaomi could be the first to join the list with a device coming later this month.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WTS4f3MojMM38yEBeK7nSj" name="WhatsApp app lock beta.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the changed app unlock screen on WhatsApp beta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WTS4f3MojMM38yEBeK7nSj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, those users can potentially lock WhatsApp and use an alternate method to unlock it, such as a passcode. And, as WABetaInfo points out, anyone with a broken or malfunctioning biometric sensor on their device would also benefit from having alternative ways of unlocking WhatsApp. </p><p>WhatsApp currently offers two ways of securing conversations on the app: the first is with the app lock, and the second is via chat lock for specific conversations. If you secure specific chats, you need to use a fingerprint or your face to unlock them. This update appears to apply only to the app lock, not the chat lock. Whether this is likely to be introduced at a later date is unclear.</p><p>Currently, this update is only available to some beta testers, with the expectation that it will be rolled out to more users in the coming days. However, users are being warned against installing this particular beta update as some are encountering crashes upon opening the app. Instead, beta testers are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1768377806633762968?s=20">being advised</a> to wait for a future update, which may fix this particular issue. </p>

<ul><li>A leaked internal Meta presentation suggests that the Meta Quest 3 Lite will be called the Meta Quest 3s.</li><li>The budget headset features a unique front-facing camera array and a design similar to the Oculus Go.</li><li>It's rumored the headset will launch this year for $299 and use older Quest 2 lenses but the more powerful Quest 3 chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We got our first look at a potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3 Lite</a> in a now-deleted Reddit thread (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1769104387702460616?s=20">reposted on X</a>), revealing that Meta may call its new budget-priced VR headset the Meta Quest 3s.</p><p>The naming convention is a bit strange, as many products have used "s" after a number to denote a supercharged version of an existing product. This headset, however, is rumored to cost just $299 when it launches later this year, helping to fully replace the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Meta Quest 2</a> as the budget VR headset to buy.</p><p>The leak shows a headset design that&apos;s thicker than the Meta Quest 3 — something we expected given that Meta is likely still using older Fresnel lenses from the Quest 2 to save money — and the flatter design feels like it&apos;s borrowed from the classic Oculus Go headset from several years back.</p><p>Android Central has contacted Meta about the potential Quest 3s, but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>Notably, the underside of the headset appears to feature just a power button and a volume rocker. No lens spacing adjustment slider or wheel can be seen, further suggesting that Meta could be using older lenses for this design.</p><p>Some have questioned the authenticity of this leak, citing that the original post was suspiciously deleted from Reddit and that the leaker "forgot" to remove their own face from the leaked presentation slides. The VR community has been duped recently with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/valve/prism-vr-headset">fake Valve Prism announcement,</a> posted on a website that looked authentic but turned out to be an elaborate hoax of the standalone headset Valve has been rumored to be working on.</p><p>Regardless of whether this design is authentic, we&apos;re very confident that Meta is launching a budget-minded Quest 3 headset this year. The original China-only launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-lite-china-plans-foiled">was allegedly scrapped</a> after plans to partner with Tencent fell through, leaving Meta to launch the headset elsewhere throughout the world to replace the aging Quest 2 in the price bracket.</p><p>Meta is said to be using the same powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 headset in the Meta Quest 3s as it uses in the more expensive Meta Quest 3. It&apos;s also said the headset will continue to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-first-details">color mixed reality</a> instead of the fuzzy black and white video from the Quest 2&apos;s cameras.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Infinix announced the Note 40, Note 40 Pro (4G and 5G), and Note 40 Pro Plus in Malaysia.</li><li>The latest mid-range models boast a dedicated chip for charging called the Cheetah X1 chip.</li><li>Infinix also added support for wireless charging to its newest lineup of smartphones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Infinix announced today its latest mid-range models, the Infinix Note 40, Note 40 Pro (4G and 5G variants), and Note 40 Pro Plus at Sepang International Circuit in Selangor, Malaysia.</p><p>Like the Note 30 series last year, the latest mid-range models boast Infinix&apos;s <em>All-Round FastCharge</em> solution, but with quite a few significant upgrades. Infinix’s All-Round FastCharge 2.0 technology takes things a step further with 100W <em>Multi-Speed FastCharge</em> (which can juice up your phone to 50% in just 8 minutes in hyper mode) and MagCharge. But the headline feature is the company&apos;s first in-house Cheetah X1 chip.</p><p>Infinix says its new dedicated chip outperforms traditional ones by a whopping 204%. According to the company, the chip&apos;s smaller size means electrical data doesn&apos;t have to travel as far inside the phone. Less distance means less heat, which equals better performance overall, as per Infinix.</p><p>The chip has three modules that cover a lot of ground. There&apos;s one for supporting different scenes, which means your phone can handle various charging functions like <em>Multi-Speed FastCharge</em>, <em>Bypass Charging Mode,</em> <em>Reverse Charge Mode</em>, and even multi-protocol fast charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="jdCj8zXiBv8iBn4CyDjym5" name="Infinix-Note-40-Pro-Plus-green.jpg" alt="Infinix Note 40 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdCj8zXiBv8iBn4CyDjym5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the high-precision power detection feature constantly checks how much juice is flowing into your phone in real time, and it adjusts settings automatically to prevent overheating and keep your phone cool. Furthermore, the safety protection feature is loaded with 63 different protection schemes to cover you throughout the whole charging process.</p><p>Wireless charging also got a boost to 20W Wireless Magcharge, up from 15W in last year&apos;s model. The company also announced the Infinix MagKit to make your magnetic charging experience super easy. It includes the MagCase for your phone, the MagPad charging pad, and the MagPower power bank.</p><p>The Note 40 series can also be charged even when it&apos;s as cold as -20 °C, according to Infinix. Plus, it has Bypass Charging 2.0, which filters current to keep your phone cool during intense gaming or binge-watching sessions.</p><p>You can share power with other devices, wired or wirelessly, at speeds up to 10W. And with PD3.0 protocol support, you can even charge your laptop using your phone&apos;s charger.</p><p>In addition to the Cheetah X1 chip, the Note 40 Pro and 40 Pro Plus include MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7020 under the hood. However, the standard variant is powered only by the Helio G99 Ultimate processor. The Pro Plus has up to 24GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, while the standard and Pro models are capped at 16GB of RAM.</p><p>The rest of the features are what you&apos;d typically see in many of today&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">beloved budget phones</a>, including a 6.78-inch FullHD+ AMOLED screen for all models with Gorilla Glass G55 protection. The screens feature a 55-degree curve and Corning Gorilla Glass protection.</p><p>Keeping the lights on for the Pro Plus is 4,600mAh battery, while the Pro and regular variants pack a 5000mAh battery.</p><p>Infinix also introduced a new feature called <em>Active Halo</em> that blends AI and design. It gives the Note 40 series a whole new vibe by lighting up the camera module with lifelike pulsations. The light show changes depending on what you&apos;re up to, whether it&apos;s getting calls or notifications, playing games or tunes, charging your phone, or chatting with the voice assistant, Folax.</p>

<p>On the optics side of things, the lineup comes with slick in-sensor zoom tech that lets you get up close and personal with your shots. The phones flaunt a 108MP main camera to pull off 3x Lossless Superzoom. Plus, if you opt for the Pro series, you get Optical Image Stabilization thrown in for extra steady snaps.
