<ul><li>Google's previously spotted Maps UI changes are now rolling out after facing another round of development.</li><li>The update to Maps brings in a "sheet-based" style and also alters how users experience directional information in the search bar.</li><li>Google previously detailed several AI features on the way for Maps while also informing users of a disappearing web feature that'll slide onto Android.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A Google Maps redesign that&apos;s been in the works for the past few months is finally hitting Android devices for the app&apos;s stable version.</p><p>After being popped back into the oven, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/14/google-maps-android-redesign/">9to5Google</a> reports that Google has started rolling out its UI overhaul for Maps on Android. To start, version <strong>11.136.x</strong> changes how users will experience direction searches. It was discovered that the UI now displays your starting location and end destination after asking. Google has also shifted the mode switcher to the bottom of the UI.</p><p>The other side of these changes is a new "sheet-based" UI, which affects the locations we view in the app. Now, when looking up a place, users will see a new, moveable sheet at the bottom of the app. It seems this is designed to give users more agency when seeking written information or when eager to see more of the map itself.</p><p>That new sheet is extendable, which users can do by long-pressing the grayed handle and sliding up their screen. It will hold details like location names, ratings, directions, reviews, photos, and more, similar to the old design.</p><p>The publication notes that users can quickly exit the new expandable sheet in Maps for places by hitting the "X" or swiping the left or right edge on their devices. Additionally, the old "swipe up on the search bar" to hide function has bowed out. The expandable sheet seems to take care of that after reaching a certain height.</p>

<p>The update should start arriving on more Android devices as we push through the week. We&apos;ve noticed the update already internally, so more should see it soon. The post notes that iOS phones have not yet picked it up.</p><p>Google&apos;s work to overhaul the Maps UI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-directions-ui-redesign-rollout">was spotted earlier this year</a> in February. Many of the changes previewed in that test build have made their way onto the stable version of the app.</p><p>The world of maps has been relatively quiet. However, Google teased¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-directions-ui-redesign-rollout" target="_blank">that there are Gen AI</a> features¬†that are headed its way. The company detailed some features, such as one that will aid users in finding locations and will also offer pre-made options. The AI will display its results based on category, review summaries, and more.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside of the mobile Maps space, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-gets-rid-of-another-feature-on-web">dropped another feature</a> from its web version. Google Maps Timeline is set to leave web-based users by December 1 and arrive on Android for mobile folks.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirmed on its South Korea forum the devices that are set to receive One UI 6.1.1 and several AI-backed upgrades.</li><li>The Galaxy S22, S23, and S24 series devices are eligible, alongside its foldables from the past two years and two generations of tablets.</li><li>One UI 6.1.1 was previously rumored to be the reason behind Samsung's delay of One UI 7, considering its AI updates.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Samsung&apos;s latest foldables getting to¬†experience One UI 6.1.1, the company is now confirming who else should expect the next iterative update.</p><p>Social media tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1812735763991159025">Tarun Vats</a> posted Samsung&apos;s confirmation of One UI 6.1.1 supported devices on X. The company stated in a post that owners of the Galaxy S22 series, Galaxy 23 series (including the S23 FE), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">the S24 series</a> should expect the update.</p><p>A few of Samsung&apos;s previous foldable devices, like the Galaxy Z Flip 4, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 4, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a>, are also eligible. Lastly, the brand&apos;s Tab S8 and Tab S9 series tablets will receive the next One UI 6 update.</p>

Sketch to Image ¬†lets users draw on a photo while the AI brings it to life.</p><p>We&apos;re still left wondering when Samsung could roll out One UI 6.1.1. However, it was previously rumored that its work¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delay-one-ui-6-1-1-ai" target="_blank">had been delayed on One UI 7</a>. It was stated that the next One UI 6 update packs "many new" AI features, and we&apos;ve seen a few of those listed today (July 15) by Samsung following Unpacked.</p><p>Not only are the aforementioned features expected, but the S24 series is set to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24s-slow-mo-hdr-boost-confirmed">gain an HDR boost</a>, too.</p><p>Moreover, there&apos;s speculation that these confirmed One UI 6.1.1 devices could only involve ones eligible for AI upgrades. It&apos;s unclear if the S21 series and the Flip 3/Fold 3 will pick this up at some point, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see, officially.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-wireless-charger-carefully-for-the-watch-ultra-xa0-2">Choose your wireless charger carefully for the Watch Ultra¬†</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> ships with a wireless charging puck in the box, more specifically, the new EP-OL300 fast wireless charger. The charging puck has a magnetic pad that attaches to the bottom of the watch, while the other end is a Type-C port that&apos;ll need to be plugged into a charger or device capable of delivering 10W or more for fast charging to work.¬†</p><p>The Watch Ultra uses the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) wireless charging standard, but unlike the previous generation, it isn&apos;t officially compatible with older chargers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-orange-buttons-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Galaxy Watch Ultra still uses the same charging tech as previous models, older Samsung watch chargers <em>may</em> work, but the company does not recommend this as the speeds are slower, which could cause excessive heating. We&apos;re sure there will be more first-party and third-party chargers in the future, but for now, it&apos;s best to stick to the one that comes in the box.¬†</p><p>One feature that has been dropped is the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-and-watch-7-ultra-are-missing-a-killer-feature">charge the Watch Ultra wirelessly</a> on the back of a compatible Samsung phone. The new model no longer supports charging via Wireless PowerShare due to the new layout of the rear sensor and glass design. It&apos;s not a huge loss since this type of charging was limited to about 5W, but it was handy when you absolutely needed a small boost and didn&apos;t have your charger with you. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> still support it, but it won&apos;t work with the Watch Ultra.¬†</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has a large 590mAh battery that&apos;s rated to last for 100 hours in Power Saving mode and 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving mode. The Ultra is Samsung&apos;s most expensive watch yet, at $649.99. You can preorder it now, and it will go on sale on July 24.¬†</p>

You could buy a Galaxy Ring and keep using your older Galaxy Watch.

<p>The value of a new Galaxy Watch depends, as always, on how out-of-date your current watch is. Each new generation adds a few new perks, so the Watch 7&apos;s value is relative.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> has a two-generation-old Exynos, thicker display bezel, smaller battery capacity, no skin temp sensor, slower charging, and just got its last Wear OS update. If that&apos;s your current watch, I can&apos;t think of a better time to update. Trade in your Watch 4 when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch7/buy/" target="_blank"><strong>preorder the Watch 7 on Samsung.com</strong></a> and it&apos;ll only cost $125, including an extra band.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> owners have a temperature sensor, proper sapphire glass protection, the current 10W charging speed, and Wear OS 6 promised for next year. Still, it has the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-vs-5">downsides compared to the Watch 6</a> like the smaller displays and older Exynos with less RAM. A Watch 5 trade-in drops the upgrade price to <strong>$100 plus the extra band</strong>.</p><p>Any recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> owners have the toughest call. The Watch 6 and 7 share the same displays, memory, battery capacity, and protection. It has double the storage for those who use their watch for music streaming instead of their phone, a niche concern. Again, the post-trade-in price on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch7/buy/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung.com</strong></a> is <strong>$100</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 6 (left) and Watch 7 (right) aren't all that different. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your main reasons for upgrading are the Exynos W1000 CPU, the revamped health sensors for more accurate HR data, and the dual-band GPS.¬†Are these enough?</p><p>I did an early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ulta fitness test</a> against a a heart rate monitor and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> with dual-band GPS, and was very impressed with the revamped accuracy for both. The Galaxy Watch 7 shares the same HR LEDs and GPS antenna, so it should be equally accurate ‚Äî far better than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-fitness-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 6 fitness test</a> last year.</p><p>Also, I strapped on my heavy Ultra for sleep tracking last night and found that it gave me the same nightly blood oxygen average as my Garmin watch (high-90s percentage) instead of the low-90s or high-80s that my Watch 6 Classic registered.</p><p>As for overall speed, the Galaxy Watch Ultra certainly delivers on speed, zooming through tiles, scrolling smoothly, and opening apps quickly. Samsung claims the Exynos W1000 is "2.7x quicker" at launching apps than the Exynos W930, or up to 3.7x faster for multi-core tasks.¬†</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can certainly notice a difference in snappiness and smoothness putting the Watch Ultra and Watch 6 Classic side-by-side, but the older watch isn&apos;t <em>that</em> much slower. The Ultra-Watch 5 gap with less RAM and the Exynos W920 chip is much more significant. If you have the Watch 6, you&apos;ll enjoy the Watch 7&apos;s extra speed, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s strictly necessary.</p><p>Overall, you should choose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> upgrade if you&apos;re (A) using an older watch and need a real upgrade or (B) you&apos;re an impatient techie who truly needs top-tier specs every single year. Why <em>skip</em> the Galaxy Watch 7? If you&apos;re used to your Galaxy Watch 5 Pro&apos;s extra battery life or Watch 6 Classic&apos;s rotating bezel.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-option-2-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-watch-ultra"><span>Option 2: Upgrade to the Galaxy Watch Ultra</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-apps-grid.jpg" alt="Apps on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Ultra</a>, the key differences are its rugged titanium frame, the same 590mAh capacity as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, the extra 1,000 nits of brightness, a third button for exercise shortcuts, a built-in siren and LTE antenna, and unique bands.</p><p>Galaxy Watch 5 Pro owners might be the primary target for the Galaxy Watch Ultra. You paid extra for its titanium build and three-day battery life, without needing a physical bezel. Now, you&apos;re jumping ahead two Exynos generations with 33% more RAM, improving from 1,000 to 3,000 nits while removing the thicker display border, and adding properly accurate HR and GPS data.</p><p>Basically, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has become your only way to get a longer-lasting Galaxy Watch in 2024. It&apos;s a pricey proposition, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/" target="_blank"><strong>trading in either the Watch 5 Pro or 6 Classic cuts $430 off the preorder price</strong></a> and includes an extra band, making it cost the same as a full-priced Galaxy Watch 7 (<strong>$299</strong>).¬†</p><p>That&apos;s a great deal for Watch 5 Pro owners with two-year-old hardware, who originally <em>paid</em> $450 for it!</p><p>Why avoid a Galaxy Watch Ultra upgrade? Watch 5 Pro owners will have to accept adding an extra 14g/0.5oz of weight; choose the nylon band over the marine band if you&apos;re concerned. Watch 6 Classic owners will find the Ultra weighs about the same but no longer has that physical bezel for seamless controls‚Äîand they&apos;re getting fewer relative upgrades. It&apos;ll be an adjustment, but still potentially worth it since you&apos;re getting that same $430 off.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-option-3-buy-a-galaxy-ring-keep-your-current-watch"><span>Option 3: Buy a Galaxy Ring, keep your current watch</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4ctBCNrQJTj22inn3z6ZDL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-wearing-01.jpg" alt="Wearing the gold Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ctBCNrQJTj22inn3z6ZDL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why buy the Galaxy Ring instead of the Galaxy Watch 7? The Galaxy Ring tracks a few of the same metrics ‚Äî heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, steps and workout effort via the accelerometer, and sleep stages and quality ‚Äî but not other health data like AFib, body composition, sleep apnea, and GPS/elevation tracking. Plus, you can&apos;t fit as many LEDs into a petite ring.</p><p>We haven&apos;t determined yet whether the Galaxy Ring matches the Galaxy Watch 7 for accuracy, and can only do so after a thorough review; we were, at least, very impressed by how comfortable and stylish it is during our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring hands-on</a>.</p><p>Choose the Galaxy Ring if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hate sleeping with a smartwatch</a> but want nighttime insights into your health. You can wear both the Galaxy Ring and your older Galaxy Watch during the day and have Samsung pick and choose the best data from both devices. Then, at night, you&apos;ll get insights into your body&apos;s health and daily energy that the Watch 7 can&apos;t deliver if it sits on your nightstand.</p><p>This option will require a new way of thinking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> owners. Owning both a smartwatch and a smart ring is an expensive proposition unless you space out your purchases and make both of them last. So maybe you can buy this smart ring and try to make your current Galaxy Watch last another few years.</p><p>Another option (let&apos;s call it <strong>Option 3.5</strong>) is to buy the Galaxy Watch 7 <em>and</em> Galaxy Ring. The Galaxy Ring has no trade-in option, but assuming you can trade in a Watch 5 or 6 to get your 7, the total price adds up to $499. If you can make both devices last for a few years, you <em>might</em> end up calling it a bargain.¬†</p>

In June alone, 1,200 new domains associated with Amazon cropped up, of which 85% were flagged as malicious or suspected of being malicious.</p><p>"In June 2024, we discovered a widespread phishing campaign mimicking the Amazon brand, particularly targeting the US," Check Point added.¬†</p><p>Scammers can use many methods to reach you, but the most common is disguising themselves as official Amazon websites or accounts.¬†Some of the newly established phishing sites recently spotted by the publication were:¬†</p><p><strong>amazon-onboarding[.]com: </strong>a newly registered fraudulent site, specifically targeting carrier-related credentials.</p><p><strong>amazonmxc[.]shop:¬†</strong>a fake Amazon Mexico website designed as a replica of amazon.com.mx. It looks like the real deal with a login button as well.¬†</p><p><strong>amazonindo[.]com: </strong>Another phishing site that isn&apos;t Amazon that collects users‚Äô login credentials upon clicking the "login" button.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, these phishing attacks end up right in the user&apos;s inbox. They send very convincing emails/text messages with links to massive discounts or deals, luring them to divulge login credentials or, worse, their credit card details. Sometimes, these messages carry a threat, like login details being compromised or the will account shut down if the users don&apos;t act quickly ‚Äîcreating a sense of panic in customers. ¬†</p><p>Clicking on the link might prompt the victim to sign in to a look-alike Amazon site, exposing their credentials to the hacker, or the link may attempt to download malicious software into the device, through which the hacker can get access to all the information on the laptop/phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:452px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.64%;"><img id="hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb" name="Phishing-email-Amazon-Prime-Day.png" alt="Phishing email example" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="452" height="482" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Check Point)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, users sometimes get texts from spoofed numbers claiming to be a local post office or Fedex/UPS about an undeliverable package, with a link that tries to get people&apos;s credit card details. These are especially common in the U.S. and Canada around Prime Day Sales.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:627px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.09%;"><img id="tJhZkNF3KBUHXoeex6FCv9" name="shipping-scam.png" alt="Shipping-scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJhZkNF3KBUHXoeex6FCv9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="627" height="220" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometimes hackers can also call victims claiming to be Amazon customer service representatives offering deals on various products, or again asking shoppers for their personal information, stating that a payment didn&apos;t go through on their recent order or their account has been hacked into.¬†</p><p>Another way that scammers can reach customers is through their social media accounts. They can slide into your DMs promising Prime membership cards or free Amazon gift cards specifically during Prime Days. Some scammers may also share enticing giveaways on their social media accounts ¬†or ads related to Prime Day deals.</p><p>"The scammer&apos;s message may even prompt you to insert your payment information to cover shipping costs for your free item," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.norton.com/blog/online-scams/amazon-scams">Norton&apos;s</a> website stated.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-spot-prime-day-scams-2">Ways to spot Prime Day scams</h2>
<ul><li>NordVPN's <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/amazon-prime-day-scams/">website</a> asks buyers to carefully look through emails and messages for signs for grammatical errors, generic terms like " Dear customer" or a threat/ urgency in the email forcing you to click a link or respond to the message.</li><li>Most phishing emails or links contain gibberish or misspelled URLs that resemble Amazon's customer service IDs.¬†</li><li>Anyone requesting for personal or financial information like passwords, credit card details, or Social Security numbers via email or phone, on the pretext of closing an Amazon account.</li><li>Sales sent via emails or social media accounts, that look too good to be true, with prices slashed to 90%, luring people to purchase from their website.¬†</li></ul>
<h2 id="being-phished-here-apos-s-what-to-do-2">Being phished? Here&apos;s what to do</h2>
<p>In the event that you come across such phishing emails/scams, it&apos;s best to verify the email IDs and look for red flags associated with them, as mentioned above. One way to steer clear of unnecessary hacking is to make sure to purchase from the official Amazon.com website rather than using third-party sites to access deals.¬†</p><p>If someone calls you pretending to be Amazon&apos;s customer service, its best to avoid sharing any information with them over the phone/message and directly contact Amazon customer support through official channels, like the app or the legitimate website.¬†</p><p>Amazon has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4YFYCCNUSENA23B#:~:text=Learn%20to%20identify%2C%20prevent%2C%20and%20report%20scams.&text=If%20you%20received%20suspicious%20communication,at%20reportascam%40amazon.com.">clearly mentioned</a> that it "will never send you an unsolicited message that asks you to provide sensitive personal information like your social insurance number, tax ID, bank account number, credit card information, ID questions like your mother&apos;s maiden name or your password." Customers can also report suspicious emails/calls via¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909130" target="_blank">Amazon&apos;s</a> official website.¬†</p><p>Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year kicks off on July 16th, and it&apos;s almost time for the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-android-phone-deals-2024">Prime Day deals</a> to hit the site.¬†In 2023, over the course of the two-day shopping event, Prime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion.¬†</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s newest smartwatches ‚Äî the Galaxy Watch Ultra and the Galaxy Watch 7 ‚Äî are finally here. Although the two wearables share quite a few similarities when it comes to core hardware specifications, the Galaxy Watch Ultra packs in some extra bells and whistles as well. It&apos;s also Samsung&apos;s most premium smartwatch to date and marks the beginning of a new category in the company&apos;s lineup of wearables.</p><p>That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is, technically, still a successor and an upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. But just how big of an upgrade it is? More importantly, if you already have the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, should you even care? Let&apos;s compare the Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and see how they stack up against each other!</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-6-classic-design-display-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: Design, display, and hardware</h2>
<p>Debuting with a new, squircle-shaped case, the Galaxy Watch Ultra visually stands out from the majority of the best Android smartwatches out there. The &apos;cushion design&apos; (as Samsung calls it) draws inspiration from some of the most recognizable cushion case wristwatches (such as the Panerai Radiomir), while the case itself is now made of titanium. You also get a new &apos;Dynamic Lug System&apos; that lets you jazz up the look of the smartwatch using some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-bands" target="_blank">best Galaxy Watch Ultra bands</a>, all with little to no effort. In comparison, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic has a more traditional-looking, rounded case made from stainless steel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-apps.jpg" alt="The app list on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of a digital crown, the Galaxy Watch Ultra comes with a new action button on the side that can be used to start/pause workouts, manage lap timings, and even sound off an emergency alarm. The Orange &apos;Quick Button&apos; is flanked by &apos;Home&apos; and &apos;Back&apos; buttons on each side for navigation. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic also features two buttons on the side but even more importantly, it comes with the rotating bezel that has been a defining characteristic of Samsung&apos;s smartwatches over the past few years. It&apos;s also worth noting that while the Galaxy Watch Ultra only comes in one size (47mm), the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is available in two sizes (43mm and 47mm).</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s 1.47-inch screen is a tad smaller than the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic&apos;s 1.5-inch display (for the 47mm version), but they&apos;re both circular Super AMOLED panels with a resolution of 480x480 pixels and Sapphire Crystal protection. Both smartwatches are IP68-certified and comply with the MIL-STD-810H standard, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra is much more suited for adventure lovers, having twice the water resistance of the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LnNWzNqeP2RvMNEXk7qFxE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-white-bezels-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LnNWzNqeP2RvMNEXk7qFxE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Powering the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the Exynos W1000 SoC, which has a penta-core processor built on the 3nm process node. Conversely, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic sports the Exynos W930 chipset, which features a dual-core processor built on the 5nm process node. Although both smartwatches have 2GB of RAM, the use of newer and more efficient hardware should give the Galaxy Watch Ultra a significant performance boost over the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. The Galaxy Watch Ultra also includes twice the storage of the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, giving you more space for all your apps and data.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-rotating-bezel-workouts.jpg" alt="Selecting a workout on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic already does a fantastic job of tracking all your fitness-related metrics, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra really takes things to the next level. Both smartwatches have a laundry list of sensors (e.g., Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, Electrical Heart Signal, and Temperature) that collect information about your body&apos;s various health-related parameters, which are then analyzed and turned into actionable insights that you can view in the Samsung Health app. Apart from that, both wearables can detect a plethora of workouts automatically and log all kinds of data (e.g., distance covered, calories burned) to help you stay at the top of your game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-multisport.jpg" alt="Choosing a workout after pressing the action button on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has been designed to be the perfect companion for long-distance runners, cyclists, and other athletes involved in endurance sports. The smartwatch supports one-touch multisport tracking and comes with a new &apos;Functional Threshold Power&apos; test that lets you hit your peak cycling performance, although you do need a power meter paired with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones" target="_blank">Samsung smartphone</a> for it to work. Combine all that with goodies like the new Race feature (which lets you track your current pace against previous records), and the Galaxy Watch Ultra might just end up being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness" target="_blank">best fitness smartwatches</a> of the year.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-6-classic-software-other-features-and-battery-life-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: Software, other features, and battery life</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5" target="_blank">Wear OS 5</a>, the latest version of Google&apos;s wearable-focused software platform. Introduced at Google I/O 2024, Wear OS 5 primarily focuses on battery life improvements and under-the-hood optimizations. That being said, Samsung&apos;s flavor of Wear OS 5 comes overlaid with One UI 6 Watch and has quite a few features of its own, with &apos;Galaxy AI&apos; arguably being the biggest highlight.</p><p>Yep, you read that right! After smartphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai" target="_blank">Galaxy AI</a> has now made its way to Samsung&apos;s smartwatches as well. It analyzes all the key wellness metrics gathered by the Galaxy Watch Ultra and uses that information to build your daily &apos;Energy Score&apos;. You can use this score to get a better idea about your overall fitness and if needed, make the necessary changes. The Galaxy Watch Ultra also lets you respond to friends and family from your wrist, using Galaxy AI to come up with suggested quick replies that match the tone of your conversations. Galaxy AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted" target="_blank">will eventually come</a> to the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic too when it gets Wear OS 5, but the experience is likely to be a bit different.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zDV4Wf5rcn5QgiwdaBBGs6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-change-watchface.jpg" alt="Changing faces on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zDV4Wf5rcn5QgiwdaBBGs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both smartwatches have all the essentials when it comes to connectivity, including dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC for contactless payments. However, while you can get the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic without LTE as well, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is only available with LTE. Since the Galaxy Watch Ultra is aimed at outdoor enthusiasts, it also features a much wider operating temperature range. And with dual-frequency GPS for better accuracy, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is much better poised to go against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps" target="_blank">best GPS smartwatches and fitness trackers</a> out there.</p><p>Now let&apos;s talk about battery life. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic has a 425mAh battery (for the 47mm version), which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank">Android Central&apos;s Michael Hicks found</a> to be barely enough for a full day of use. If you use features like GPS tracking and automatic workout detection regularly, you&apos;ll most likely need to charge the watch more than once a day. On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch Ultra comes with a 590mAh battery that&apos;s among the biggest that Samsung has put in a watch, matching up with that of the Galaxy 5 Pro. The company&apos;s claim of up to 100 hours of endurance (with Power Saving mode) seems a bit far-fetched but given the power-efficient hardware, we&apos;re hopeful of getting some good numbers when we put the Galaxy Watch Ultra through its paces.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-6-classic-should-you-upgrade-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: Should you upgrade?</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is unlike any other smartwatch that Samsung has ever made. It&apos;s extremely durable, has a variety of features that make it perfect for athletes and adventure junkies, and a unique (even if somewhat polarizing) design. The hardware is also quite powerful, and you&apos;re getting the latest version of Wear OS 5 out of the box. Then there&apos;s the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, which continues to be a well-rounded wearable that&apos;s ideal for just about anyone, despite being nearly a year old at this point. Without a doubt, these are two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch" target="_blank">best Android smartwatches</a> currently available in the market. But if you already have the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, should you really consider upgrading to the Galaxy Watch Ultra?</p>

<p>Well, it depends on the kind of smartwatch user you are. Do you love endurance sports? Are you someone who&apos;s always looking for a new trail to hike? If the answer to those questions is yes, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is probably going to be a worthy upgrade for you. Sure, the price is a little steep, but you&apos;ll be getting a top-of-the-line smartwatch packed with the best hardware and software.</p><p>On the contrary, if your smartwatch use just involves things like contactless payments and staying on top of your notifications, and you also like to track your workouts and keep tabs on your overall fitness, keep the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. It&apos;s still a very capable and stylish wearable that&apos;ll continue to serve you well for quite a while. Moreover, since it has a standard lug design compatible with quick-release bands, you&apos;ll have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-6-and-watch-6-classic-watch-bands" target="_blank">lot of bands (both official and third-party)</a> to pick from as well.</p>

The Galaxy Ring works with a non-Samsung phone, but it limits the available features.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="these-are-the-perks-when-using-a-samsun-phone-with-your-galaxy-ring-2">These are the perks when using a Samsun phone with your Galaxy Ring</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring has great features that help you better track your health. Although you can use the Galaxy Ring on a non-Samsung phone, you are able to use some exclusive Galaxy Ring features only on a Samsung phone. You&apos;ll experience more seamless integration when using a Samsung smartphone.</p><p>For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> can only offer features such as Energy Score<strong> </strong>at the beginning of each day with a Samsung Galaxy AI phone, a Samsung account, and the Samsung Health app. Galaxy AI evaluates data taken from physical and mental conditions, such as sleep, activity, sleeping heart rate, and sleeping heart rate variability, letting you know if you need to take it easy and rest.</p><p>By using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>, you can count on¬†Wellness Tips¬†throughout the day, ranging from losing weight to getting more exercise, getting a better night&apos;s sleep, and taking care of your overall health. The Wellness Tips come from the health data in mind and let you know if you should sleep in instead of going for that 7 AM hike or meditate before you go to sleep.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Health<strong> </strong>app saves health information, and the new sleep AI algorithm gives you a daily Sleep Score and a snoring analysis, all within the Samsung ecosystem. If you&apos;re also using a Galaxy Watch, it could also help with your ring&apos;s battery life since Samsung Health will pull the data from the device with a stronger signal. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, you get all the health data you need without a subscription.</p><p>Samsung users can also enjoy the Double Pinch Gestures, but the gestures feature only allows you to dismiss alarms or for camera control. It will be limited to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 at launch but should arrive on the Galaxy S24 shortly. You will need OneUI 6.1.1 or above on your Samsung phone, and the clock app version must be 12.3.30.35 or above. You need to turn the feature on since it&apos;s off by default and enable it on the Samsung Galaxy Wearable app. The exclusive Galaxy Ring features allow you to do various things, but keeping your apps updated is also essential.</p><p>Find My Ring (supported by Samsung Find) is another feature available only on Samsung phones. Live tracking is not supported, and you will only see the last connected location for your Galaxy Ring. Samsung warns that compatible smartphones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-expanded-wearables-portfolio-unlocks-intelligent-health-experiences-for-all">available features can vary</a> depending on your carrier, country, or device. The Galaxy Ring will not vibrate and make any audible sound for an easier find, but the LED lights will flash.</p><p>The exclusive Galaxy Ring features list is not long for now. Time will tell if users get any more.</p>

Ahead of the release, new hands-on videos have already leaked on TikTok.</p><p>The account dubbed PixoPhone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_9_pro_xl_stars_in_handson_video_compared_to_pixel_9_and_galaxy_s24_ultra-news-63704.php">GSMArena</a>) received the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL exactly one month before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">their launch</a> in Ukraine and posted a hands-on video comparing them side by side. Moreover, the same channel placed the Pro XL model right next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> currently available.</p>

<p>The hands-on video of both Pixel 9 Pro phones shows them in all angles, including the giant camera visors. The Pixel 9 Pro XL, the ultra-premium model in the lot, appears glossy, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro has a matte finish.¬†</p><p>The XL model&apos;s camera visor additionally features a periscopic lens and, presumably, the temperature sensor. The two other cameras appear identical to the Pixel 9 Pro. The rest of the button placements are alike on both handsets. As seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">renders</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL carry a boxy design with squared-off edges overall and rounded corners.</p>

<p>As seen in the video, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, compared right next to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, showcases how wide Samsung&apos;s flagship is compared to the upcoming Pixel handset.¬†</p><p>Overall, the Pixel 9 Pro XL looks a bit small when compared to the Ultra, and needless to say, the device takes advantage of the S-Pen, too; hence, the bigger form factor is inevitable.</p>
<p>While Google has planned for an early reveal this year, leakers have found a way to showcase the upcoming phones in full relatively early as well.</p><p>Also, as we see the Google Pixel 9 Pro and the Pro XL in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-in-pink-leaks-again-in-video">leaked</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">videos</a>, a previous hands-on video‚Äîin fact, a couple of them‚Äîshowed the standard Pixel 9 device in an interesting Pink colorway. The device also featured a glossy finish, and the camera module sported a matte finish.¬†</p><p>The device also seemed significantly smaller than the Pro model. The Pixel 9 leaked video also showed the device&apos;s display and presumably Android 14/Android 15 running on it.</p>

<ul><li>Google is discontinuing Lacros, an experimental Chrome browser designed for ChromeOS.</li><li>The move comes as the company shifts ChromeOS to development on large portions of the Android stack.</li><li>However, Google's plans aren't changing ‚Äî it hopes to achieve the same goals with ChromeOS and Android that it wanted to with Lacros.¬†</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>For about the last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromeos-lacros-coming-soon]">it seemed like Lacros was the future of ChromeOS</a>. It&apos;s an experimental Chrome browser designed for Chromebooks, and it stands for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/lacros.md" target="_blank"><strong>L</strong>inux¬†<strong>A</strong>nd¬†<strong>C</strong>h<strong>R</strong>ome¬†<strong>OS</strong></a>." The idea is simple ‚Äî ChromeOS and the Chrome browser are too intertwined right now, which is limiting. You can&apos;t update one without updating another, and this becomes quite a problem when your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> doesn&apos;t receive OS updates anymore.¬†</p><p>Macs and PCs also have end-of-support timeframes, and devices will eventually stop receiving macOS or Windows updates. However, these computers can still download the latest version of Chrome for many years after they stop receiving OS updates. ChromeOS can&apos;t match that experience because of the deep ties between the browser and the operating system. That&apos;s a problem since an insecure browser can open users up to cybersecurity threats.</p><p>To date, Google&apos;s solution to this problem has been Lacros. It would decouple Chrome and ChromeOS, making it possible to issue browser updates separate from OS updates. That&apos;s changing, the company shared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromeos-beta/thread/284972520/ending-support-for-lacros-experimental-version-of-chrome-browser-for-chromeos?hl=en&sjid=18029455548890934257-NC" target="_blank">community post</a>.¬†</p><p>"Back in August 2023, we previewed our work on an¬†<strong>experimental</strong>¬†version of Chrome browser for ChromeOS named¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromeos-beta/thread/230605428/launching-an-experimental-version-of-chrome-browser-for-chromeos-available-on-chromeos-dev-channel?hl=en" target="_blank">Lacros</a>, " a Chrome support manager for Google explained. "The original intention was to allow Chrome browsers on Chromebooks to swiftly get the latest features and security updates without needing a full OS update."</p><p>The post announced that Google will move away from Lacros entirely, discontinuing it as of ChromeOS 128.</p><p>"As we refocus our efforts on achieving similar objectives with¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/building-a-faster-smarter-chromebook-experience-with-the-best-of-google" target="_blank">ChromeOS embracing portions of the Android stack</a>, we have decided to end support for this experiment," the post continued. "We believe this will be a more effective way to help accelerate the pace of innovation on Chromebook."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="siWWHRY5jqv5zJcQSWFjpC" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review-5.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/siWWHRY5jqv5zJcQSWFjpC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This move won&apos;t really impact ChromeOS users since Lacros was always an experimental feature. It&apos;s a behind-the-scenes shift for Google, and it isn&apos;t surprising following its announcement that ChromeOS will be built on the Android stack moving forward. These two platforms are growing closer, and following Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">consolidation of the Pixel hardware and Android software teams</a>, this will likely continue.¬†</p><p>In many ways, this seems like a positive change. There have been times in the past where it felt like Google wasn&apos;t making moves cohesively ‚Äî where some parts of the company wasn&apos;t working in coordination with the others. Now, we&apos;re moving toward a future where Pixel hardware, Android software, and ChromeOS development may all continue in a united fashion.¬†</p><p>Lacros wasn&apos;t a wasted experiment, though. Google says that it learned a few things from beta testers, and already applied improvements to ChromeOS based on user feedback. The company specifically mentions faster login time and enhanced battery life during video playback as areas where the operating system was improved thanks to Lacros testing.¬†</p>

<p>It&apos;s easy to jump on the "Killed by Google" bandwagon ‚Äî the company does discontinue <em>a lot</em> of products. However, it&apos;s time to pump the brakes a bit in this case. Lacros being discontinued is akin to Google shuttering an internal project that you never even knew existed. It was an experiment, and that&apos;s important to remember here.</p><p>The good thing is that Google isn&apos;t dropping the goal of Lacros, which is to make Chrome more independent from ChromeOS. That&apos;s still something Google is working toward, it&apos;s just taking a different route to get there. Building ChromeOS on the Android stack is believed to result in many of the same benefits as Lacros. It&apos;s really a non-issue as far as Chromebook users are concerned.¬†</p><p>The real question is whether the switch will impact how far out these ChromeOS improvements are. The Lacros browser has existed for years, and Google spent roughly one of those years testing it on ChromeOS. Now that the company is moving to Android-based development, it could take longer for ChromeOS to see the improvements Lacros was set to bring. That is pure speculation, but it is true that Google is essentially tossing aside the work it did on Lacros outside of what has already made its way into ChromeOS.¬†</p><p>It&apos;s also possible that Google, having extensive familiarity with Android as its developer, could bring these changes to ChromeOS more rapidly. We&apos;ve already seen the company use the Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks to improve ChromeOS. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chrome-os-m124-may-update-changes">ChromeOS shifted its Bluetooth stack</a> from a Linux-based solution to the Android stack called Fluoride. That project started in 2021, so more behind-the-scenes work could already be in progress.¬†</p><p>To sum up, we don&apos;t really know how Google&apos;s choice of Android over Lacros will affect ChromeOS in the long term. For now, we know that the discontinuation of Lacros won&apos;t affect end users. Google still plans to release monthly updates and security fixes for ChromeOS. As such, you probably shouldn&apos;t put too much stock into Lacros&apos; departure.¬†</p>

<p>With the launch of the latest Galaxy Z Flip phone, a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 5 showdown is inevitable. By comparing the specifications for the two flip phones, you can decide if the upgrades on the newer model are worth it. There are a few changes to mention, but various specifications remain the same between the two models.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> has a massive camera upgrade that picture enthusiasts will love. Not to mention, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 also comes with fun and helpful Galaxy AI features. However, that doesn&apos;t mean the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> is a total loss.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5-design-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 5: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4236px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="5VWy24JjhKCzEneFfBNq2B" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-4.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Galaxy Z Flip 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VWy24JjhKCzEneFfBNq2B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4236" height="2383" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When pitting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> vs. Galaxy Z Flip 5, you can see that both phones have the traditional Galaxy Flip phone design with the camera and side buttons in the same area. They both share Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and weigh 187g. However, how different are they in terms of design?</p><p>The¬†Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6¬†has a square design, giving it a more portable look. It measures 71.9 x 85.1 x 14.9mm (closed) and 71.9 x 165.1 x 6.9mm (open). It has enhanced Armor Aluminum and an improved IP48 rating, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">making it waterproof</a> for up to 1.5 meters and 30 minutes. However, it is not completely dustproof.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">Z Flip 6 comes in splashy colors</a> and the frame reflects your chosen color. The colors cover the hinge, the back panel, and the rings around the camera. You can select from sahed like Blue, Mint, Crafted Black, Yellow, Silver Shadow, Peach, and White. The back of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a matte finish for a less shiny look, making it 10% more scratch-resistant. It also has tougher edges and hinges, making it 10% stronger.</p><p>On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 measures 71.9 x 85.1 x 15.1mm (closed) and 71.9 x 165.1 x 6.9mm (open). The older model also has Armor Aluminum, but it&apos;s not as robust as the newer one. You won&apos;t find dust protection on this model, but you get the same IPX8 rating to protect it from water. Like the newer model, it&apos;s waterproof for 1.5 meters for 30 minutes, so you&apos;re fine if you drop it in the bathtub.</p><p>The X doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the phone is not dust-resistant but indicates that Samsung didn&apos;t test it. The Galaxy Flip 5&apos;s frame is less colorful, but you can get it in different colors, such as Mint, Graphite, Lavender, and Cream. Unlike the newer model, it has a shiny finish.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 5 comparison reveals that the display specifications remain the same across both models. They both sport a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED main display and a 3.4-inch Super AMOLED cover display with a 2640 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution. They also share the same 1,600-nit peak brightness level and a 60Hz refresh rate for the cover screen.</p><p>There is a difference in the main display&apos;s peak brightness and screen refresh rate, though. The Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s main display peaks at 2,600 nits (matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Fold 6</a>) and has a 120Hz screen refresh rate. The display is made of a better Foldable Thin Glass (FTG) designed to reduce the visibility of the crease.</p><p>The<strong> </strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5&apos;s display¬†has a more visible crease and is less bright, with a 1,750-nit peak brightness level. It&apos;s also made of Ultra Thin Glass (UTG) instead of the newer model&apos;s better FTG.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 5 analysis reveals that some things remain the same in terms of hardware, such as the storage options being 256GB and 512GB, 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, a 10MP selfie camera, and a 12MP ultrawide camera (both cameras with OIS).</p><p>The¬†Samsung Galaxy Z¬† Flip 6¬†comes with improvements users will love, such as a more powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor like the one found on the¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, 12GB RAM, an improved 4,000mAh battery, and a 50MP (f/1.8) primary camera.</p><p>Thanks to the new vapor chamber, you won&apos;t have to worry so much about overheating, something you won&apos;t find on the older model. You&apos;ll also see a 41% faster MPU handling all the AI stuff, 25% faster graphics, and a 14% faster processor.</p><p>The older¬†Galaxy Z Flip 5¬†model has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 like the one on the Galaxy S23, a 12MP primary (f/1.8) camera, 8GB of RAM, and a smaller 3,700mAh battery. Unfortunately, neither flip phone has expandable storage, so it&apos;s best to get a memory option you&apos;re sure will meet your expectations.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> will be available on July 24th and has gone up $100 compared to the last-gen Flip 5, making it crucial to take advantage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-preorder-deals">preorder deals for the latest Flip</a> phone. The Flip 6 starts at $1,100, but if you take advantage of those deals, you will surely get it at a lower price.</p><p>The older Galaxy Z Flip 5 is available on Amazon for $767. Since there is no monumental difference between the two phones, you&apos;ll save some cash while getting various Galaxy AI features and decent specifications. The upgrade could wait if you use your current Galaxy Z Flip 5 phone for basic everyday tasks. However, the vapor chamber for cooling and the seven-year update promise is also very tempting.</p><p>To be very honest, the menial battery upgrade, newer processor, and slightly better camera aren&apos;t entirely worth the big bump in price.
