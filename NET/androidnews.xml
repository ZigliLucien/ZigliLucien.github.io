According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/">report from Counterpoint Research</a>, Google's smartphone shipments grew 20% in Q3 2024, which can be attributed to the much earlier launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series.</p><p>A second report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america/#monthly-202310-202410">Statcounter</a> shows just how drastic Pixel growth has been, with a graph revealing a jump from about 5% to a whopping 14% share between September and October. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series went on sale at the end of August, when there was a noticeable uptick in share, giving Google a good amount of time to see the Pixel 9 affected Q3 sales figures. It's worth noting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> did not go on sale until Q4 2023.</p>
<p>While Google still has some catching up to do to reach the numbers of Samsung Galaxy phones, it's clear that the company's strategy is working. The Pixel 9 series has have been impressive thanks to great cameras, standout designs, a better chipset, and fun <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> features.</p>

Now, OnePlus is getting in on the action by rolling out OxygenOS 15 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the company's current global flagship (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is still China-only for now). Some Android Central staff have already received the update, which is steadily arriving on global variants of the phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1723669843116294150">update</a> brings a host of visual improvements to the home screen, themes, and animations and should make things more fluid and uniform throughout the UI. The pulldown menu can now be separated by notifications and quick settings, similar to iPhones and some other Android phones. There's also a new Live Alerts feature that mimics Apple's Dynamic Island by showing real-time updates for apps and activities in an expandable pill at the top of the display.</p><p>There are a ton of new updates, but Android Central senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda has highlighted some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">his favorite OxygenOS 15 features</a>.</p>

The device, as hinted by the name, would be a thinner model, but that apparently might not mean that it'll be a watered-down version. A recent leak suggests that despite its thinner profile, the phone may feature an "Ultra" camera.</p><p>While the leak doesn't specify what that means, it's not hard to guess that it could adopt a 200MP camera similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and previous Ultra models. If true, it'll be interesting to see how this will fit in the phone; will it feature a massively protruding camera sensor? We don't know how "slim" this phone will be, but it may likely be thinner than the current batch of Galaxy S24 models, which come in at 7.6, 7.7, and 8.6mm for the S24, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>, and S24 Ultra, respectively.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That’s a fact and not just a guess https://t.co/AAGlsZVOIW<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854787657382957146">November 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It's also being said that if the Galaxy S25 Slim does launch, it won't arrive with the rest of the Galaxy S25 series, which is expected in January. That said, it's not clear when Samsung is planning to launch the device if it does end up coming to market.</p>

However, as exciting as it seems, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a> has already encountered some problems, with owners complaining about a yellow tint at the bottom of the display that bleeds into about an inch of the screen. Not only that, but apparently, the dark mode is not working on the device.</p><p>The problem has led to plenty of low reviews on Amazon, with the device sitting at an average of 2.6 stars. With Amazon well aware of the issue, the company is working on a fix and noting that owners can contact customer service and request a replacement or refund. That said, replacements may take some time to arrive as Amazon works on fixing the screen tint issues, although there's no word on the dark mode issue.</p>

<ul><li>The 'Saved' tab is being replaced by an 'Activity' tab that brings everything together in one place, including search history from Chrome and the Google app.</li><li>The update will simplify things by creating a single spot for your search history and saved items, instead of having them scattered across different tabs.</li><li>The change is in a limited test phase, with only a few users getting it so far, and has been in development for the past two months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s working on a new feature to make accessing your search history and saved items easier right from the main app.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-app-activity-tab-3497741/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google’s main app is getting a big update. The current "Saved" tab will be swapped out for a new "Activity" tab that pulls together all your saved items in one spot. Furthermore, it’ll give you easy access to your search history from both Chrome and the Google app.</p><p>At present, checking your History on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> and the Google app can be a hassle, with information spread across different tabs. That said, with this experiment, Google is making that job easier by creating a unified spot to access both your search history and saved items.</p><p>Google is rolling out the new feature as a test, with only a limited number of users getting it so far. According to Android Authority contributor Assemble Debug, it’s been in the works for the past two months.</p>

<p>The new "Activity" tab gives you a seamless, app-based experience instead of a web view. Plus, you’ll be able to easily save, share, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-delete-your-recent-google-search-history-on-android">delete history items</a> right from the app.</p><p>A Telegram user, @andrey4ik21pro1_q, found the new 'Activity' tab on their Pixel 8 Pro with Google app version 15.44.25.29.arm64. However, it seems that the feature wasn’t available on another Pixel 8 Pro running a newer version of the app.</p><p>The feature is expected to roll out more widely in the coming weeks, so users should be able to access it soon.</p>

Best Buy's not making anyone wait that long, as its early Black Friday deal is already underway. And as part of one of the first "Doorbusters," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p?skuId=6587911"><strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been discounted</strong></a> to its lowest price ever!</p><p>When I wrapped up my review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, I just assumed that I would swap my SIM card back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Surprisingly, that hasn't been the case, and the 9 Pro Fold remains right by my side every day. And at the very least, I implore you to try out Google's latest foldable phone for yourself, especially considering that it's $300 off.</p>

<p>If that comes as a surprise to you, you're not the only one. Samsung has a more robust software experience, while also doing a better job with handling aspect ratios. But there's just something about the 9 Pro Fold that keeps me coming back.</p><p>Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that this is basically the phone that I hoped Google would've released as a first iteration. While the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> offers a neat design, it's far from refined. However, the 9 Pro Fold solves practically all of my complaints from last year, with a few added benefits.</p><p>I've spoken about this a few times, but as someone who is a first-time father, I've quickly learned that sometimes I need a bit of help to get my son's attention for a picture. The one feature that I keep coming back to is "Made You Look," which not only gets my son's attention but usually makes him smile.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-made-you-look.jpg" alt="Made You Look on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's already come in handy more times than I can count, and with the holiday season rapidly approaching, I suspect this number will grow exponentially. Not to mention that the 9 Pro Fold will also probably act as the "group family picture" camera, as it's easy to prop it up, set a timer, and snap the picture after I jump in.</p><p>But in the event that I'm not actually able to get in the picture, Google has the solution for that. Although I don't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and the various AI features all of the time, I know that they're ready for whenever I am. This includes the "Add Me" feature, so I can snap a picture of the family, then have someone else take one of me, and just add me to the shot.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is not the perfect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, but I don't even know if such a thing exists. There are trade-offs to be found, no matter what phone you end up deciding on. But one thing I know for sure is that if I didn't already have the 9 Pro Fold, I'd be picking one up.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's latest major AI venture has exited testing and it becoming available for more Workspace users.</p><p>The company highlighted the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/google-vids-now-generally-available.html">general availability</a>" of its AI-backed video creation app, Google Vids. The post states users can "easily build" videos by leveraging its AI model Gemini for assistance. The app has generative AI features through its new "help me create" button. One standout function of Google Vids is its selection of templates.</p><p>Clicking "help me create" will reportedly produce Gemini's assistance based on your work. Google states its AI software can suggest a "script" for use or to serve as inspiration.</p><p>The templates Google alluded to are "use-based," meaning Workspace users may find the design they prefer to use in ads, meetings, and more. On a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/15082957">support page</a>, the company states that users can find these templates within the sidebar. These templates deliver a frame from which users can build off of. Google states users can choose different animations, transitions, and more.</p><p>The post adds that users will find a built-in recording studio when creating videos. From there, Workspace users can record themselves, a narration, a screen recording, or audio. However, Google Vids leans heavily on AI assistance, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/15067217?sjid=16528034210924596463-NC">Gemini can create a voice-over</a> for you. The company states this feature is available at the bottom of the script panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:898px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.82%;"><img id="PRitbPmiLYfDLxaGoYKj6b" name="google-vids-general-access-workspace-rollout" alt="Google Vids starts arriving for more Workspace users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRitbPmiLYfDLxaGoYKj6b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="898" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google then extends a warning to Workspace users interested in the Vids app. While it is expanding to "select" subscription plans, "AI-powered features like 'help me create' and AI voice-overs" remain free until December 31, 2025. The company states a "limit" may be applied to such features by 2026, but it will provide a follow-up alert around that time if it's happening.</p><p>The Google Vids expansion includes Workspace Business (Standard/Plus), Enterprise (Standard/Plus), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/google-vids-now-generally-available-for-edu.html">Education Plus</a>, Essentials, Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus. Moreover, a Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, or Education Premium add-on will find Google Vids.</p><p>The feature has started making its rounds and its rollout should be completed within 15 days.</p><p>Google first debuted its Vids app for Workspace during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-cloud-next-2024-gen-ai-announcements">Cloud Next 2024</a> event in April. This was followed up with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/we-tried-google-vids-the-new-ai-powered-video-generator-in-workspace-labs">testing phase</a> that kicked off this past summer. The company detailed Google Vids as an AI-backed tool to assist with generating storyboards alongside a wealth of editing/stylizing options. What's more, Gemini was stated to offer more suggestions when you can't decide between stock videos, images, and background music.</p><p>Additionally, Google Vids provides a "View and Collaborate" function. This lets other users (with a Workspace account) come in and work with you on a project. There is an option to "create and copy;" however, Google states this is available to "select editions."</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the rollout of its "Updates" page, which replaces the "Sharing" button in the Photos app.</li><li>The new page will inform users of new shared albums, new photos, memory, and conversation/group conversation updates.</li><li>The feature is rolling out for Android and iOS users; however, we're still waiting on the app's AI-backed features, "Ask Photos."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for its Photos app to help users stay in the loop with all the latest happenings.</p><p>As detailed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/306428786?hl=en">a community post</a>, Google is rolling the new "Updates" page in Photos for all users on Android and iOS. This new page is being touted as a shared, social hub for people who share photo albums with one another. Accessible via a new "bell icon," users will find an Updates page that places organization and what's current first.</p><p>Google states it hopes the Updates page can "foster collaboration and connection." This is designed to be a user's one-stop-shop for updates on shared albums and conversations/group conversations. Regarding the latter, the post states users will be notified if they're added to a new conversation or if another user sends a new photo. All conversations are accessible via the Photos app settings.</p><p>For shared albums, Google says its Updates area will inform you of new ones and display them in the order received. Moreover, if another user adds a new picture to a shared album, an alert will be sent so you can check it out. However, users can hop into their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections tab</a> to view their shared albums without seeing ongoing conversations and "other activities."</p><p>Other information in this new page include partner sharing, memory, and storage updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7oZELqNnLeYv5dpEJwHvU8" name="google-photos-2022-dark-mode.jpg" alt="Google Photos on a Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oZELqNnLeYv5dpEJwHvU8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google highlights the "chronological" order of the Updates page. Albums received/shared will be displayed by "today" first, before diving into "yesterday, this week, this month" and more.</p><p>As previously stated, the Updates page in Photos is rolling out today (Nov 8). The company states that users can continue to check for an update "over the coming weeks."</p><p>Speaking of the "Collections" tab, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">the "Library" tab revamp</a> for the app over the summer. Instead of that old carousel, users were presented with a more organized grid for their cloud-stored albums. The company also shifted the Locked Folder button down into a list, instead of being displayed as a larger pill-shaped button up top.</p><p>With the "Updates" page arriving, we're still waiting on the official rollout of the app's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" feature. Google Photos will soon let users conversate with an AI to discover photos they're having trouble locating. "Ask Photos" leverages the company's AI model Gemini to process your "descriptive query" and (hopefully) find what you're looking for. Google highlighted the feature in September, stating users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/#ask-photos">join its waitlist</a> to try it out before it launches.</p>

<p>Metro Awakening is the horror game I didn't know I needed. I say that because, first off, I'm not exactly a fan of the horror genre. I've enjoyed the occasional scary movie or game from time to time, but those are exceptions rather than the rule. I've also never really gotten into the Metro series despite enjoying the theme and the original release of Metro 2033.</p><p>But Metro Awakening is something special. It's a narrative-heavy, linear first-person shooter — just like the rest of the series — that had me hooked from the moment its clever intro began. It's also the first made-for-VR entry into the storied series, developed entirely by veteran VR developer Vertigo Games, the same company behind VR classics like Arizona Sunshine and After the Fall.</p><p>Despite being from a different developer, Metro Awakening feels incredibly similar to Metro 2033 in all the right ways. As the story goes, it takes place primarily in the metro train tunnels under a once great city, where you'll find yourself uncovering the horrors that both radioactivity and desperate humans created.

<p>If you've played the Arizona Sunshine games or After the Fall, you'll immediately feel familiar with the mechanics in Metro Awakening. That's not to say things are identical — the dual backpack-based inventory system is a clever new design I haven't seen yet — but everything that's good about the company's previous apocalyptic shooters sits on display for players to experience in Metro Awakening.</p><p>Intuitive on-body inventory systems, where you can consistently depend on grabbing the same item every time you reach for it, make them feel as good as a hot bar in a flat-screen game.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The first time you pull the hammer back and peer into the gun's body to make sure you still have a bullet in the chamber isn't just clutch. It's vital for immersion.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is particularly important given the level of fear the game consistently holds you in, as you'll be able to make better split-second decisions because you won't be fumbling with an unreliable inventory system. Healing is always on your left hip, a pistol always on your right, and reaching into the pocket on your chest always delivers the proper ammo or refill for the weapon you're holding.</p><p>That is, of course, so long as you've been able to hold on to enough ammo to get you through the next section. One of Metro Awakening's biggest strengths is its consistent difficulty level, which is directly relative to how much ammo you're given between any of the game's encounters.</p><p>The first time you pull the hammer back and peer into the gun's body to make sure you still have a bullet in the chamber isn't just clutch. It's vital for immersion.</p>

<p>Metro Awakening's combat encounters are as often about taking the stealthy approach as they are about blindly shooting at unseen enemies like a character in one of Ridley Scott's Alien movies. Most encounters with humans give you the option to be stealthy — which I'll encourage you to use — in order to save up as much ammo for the next encounter as possible.</p><p>But every single encounter — even the ones that very obviously imply a stealthy approach is best — can be run through Rambo style. Enemies' weapons can be taken after they are downed, and while ammo in those weapons is always severely limited, they allow skilled players to hop from enemy to enemy and piggyback in creative ways. Cans and bottles can be brought from place to place and used to distract enemies, so you can use a stealthy melee attack to take them out.</p><p>The ability to act naturally in VR dawned on me during one early encounter. While running from a giant mutant rat, I grabbed a large sliding door and closed it three-quarters of the way, blocking the rat's entry and giving me enough space to blast it to smithereens.</p><p>There's no way to do this in a non-VR game, and it makes the game feel special and bespoke in a way that another flatscreen entry couldn't.</p>

<p>There was never a time in Metro Awakening's 12-hour campaign where I felt like I was repeating the same old situation over and over again. Each hallway, air vent, metro tunnel, or other space you walk through feels unique in a way that's rarely achieved outside of something as good as Metroid Prime. While this isn't a Metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination, the variety of locales and the compelling story kept me coming back to the game for more each day.</p><p>Metro Awakening has you playing the community's doctor whose eccentric wife seems to always cause problems. When she starts hearing the voice of your long-dead son in the steam pipes, you know something bad's about to happen. The rest of the journey will have you wondering if she's sane, prophetic, or maybe somewhere in between the two. Either way, you'll be venturing further than your character's hard past has ever gone before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gmSprtaPc7XWtkK2taHUJD" name="metro-awakening-screenshot-02" alt="A screenshot of Metro Awakening taken on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmSprtaPc7XWtkK2taHUJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since many parts of the world you'll explore are radioactive, you'll need to occasionally put on a gas mask and keep track of how effective its filter is working. Finding and swapping out filters will let you explore these areas more, often helping you find survival supplies and a few collectible items. If there's any replayability in the game, it's for folks who love to re-experience specific events or to find all three postcards hidden in each chapter.</p><p>Despite not being a big fan of the horror genre, the macabre scenes depicted constantly throughout the game were fascinating in a way I didn't expect. Likewise, the horrifying creatures that had me jumping and blindly shooting were always interesting to encounter, and I regularly tried to find creative ways to dispatch them before they got too close.</p><p>While I wouldn't put Metro Awakening in the same general category as a horror game like Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife, there's no denying the importance of horror to the story and the overall atmosphere of the game. Even if you're not a fan of horror like me, I'd encourage you to try it. The Meta Quest store has a 2-hour return window, anyway, and you'll definitely get the feeling of the game in the first 30 minutes, let alone two hours.</p>

<p>If I had to name one specific critique of the Quest version of the game, it would be that I expected to see the game running at a higher resolution than it does. I used Quest Games Optimizer to boost the resolution to 130%, and it looked downright breathtaking at times, all without any noticeable performance hitches. Hopefully, Vertigo Games can patch in something like this soon.</p><p>The VR community has had its share of ups and downs with big releases this year, but this last quarter has proven to pack a serious punch that gives me high hopes for the future of big-name VR games. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> sits firmly at the top as game of the year, although Metro Awakening has already making me question which title will get the crown at the end of the year.</p>

<ul><li>A report states Motorola's "Razr 50s Ultra" was spotted passing through the Wireless Power Consortium for certification.</li><li>The listing showcased a device with a design similar to the Razr Plus (2024) with 15W wireless charging and 44W wired charging, per a second listing.</li><li>Rumors of a "Razr 50s Ultra" surfaced in September with the potential to be a cheap addition to the recent series and a 10-bit color display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola rolled out its typical pair of foldables this summer; however, there might be another addition on the horizon.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-50s-ultra-design-specifications-sgs-fimko-wireless-consortium/">91Mobiles</a>, the upcoming Motorola Razr 50s Ultra (XT2451-6) was spotted picking up its Wireless Power Consortium certification. Previous speculation theorized Motorola would keep the device close to the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr (2023)</a>, but this listing shows a more current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus (2024)</a> theme.</p><p>The company's imagery shows a large cover display, likely in the 4-inch realm like the latest Plus model.</p><p>The display seems mostly the same, meaning consumers could see a cheaper Razr 50s Ultra with 6.9-inch display. A centered, punch-hole selfie camera remains present and the screen's bezels seem relatively thin like the recent 2024 series. The publication purports the device's rear panel features a textured leather finish. Other details in its imagery reveal the device may debut with its physical power and volume buttons on the right side of the frame.</p><p>The WPC certification appearance highlighted the device's 15W of wireless charging strength. Moreover, the publication noticed the device rolling through the SGS Fumiko certification database with 44W of wired charging. Additionally, the device's model number was listed alongside five other theoretical "variants."</p><p>It's unclear what these variants could mean — or even look like. We're also still wondering about a possible launch timeframe, which is still uncertain.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:546px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.89%;"><img id="6mYZHsk4ze3pJsFzFrzBeS" name="motorola-razr-50s-ultra-certification-listing-spotted" alt="Motorola's upcoming (rumored) cheap Razr was spotted moving through the necessary certification channels." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6mYZHsk4ze3pJsFzFrzBeS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="546" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91Mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the second time we're hearing (and now seeing) a supposed "Razr 50s Ultra." Rumors of the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-rumored-affordable-razr-50s-foldable-certification">originally surfaced in September</a> as it was passing through the HDR10+ certification database. Seeing as it appeared there, speculation sided with the possibility of a 10-bit color display. More importantly, the "S" attachment was curious and pushed reports to believe it marked a "cheaper" device.</p><p>Curiously, this certification discovery comes <em>after </em>the "Motorola Razr 50s Ultra" reportedly debuted in Japan. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/motorola-razr-50s-has-been-announced-kind-of.html">Android Headlines</a>, the device was listed officially with SoftBank, a Japanese wireless service provider. The publication states that Motorola didn't announce this device itself. Regardless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.softbank.jp/mobile/products/smartphone/motorola-razr-50s/">it launched on September 27</a>. This creates a rather murky narrative, considering the recent certification appearance.</p><p>The report from 91Mobiles states that two of the recent Moto Razr 50s Ultra variants appear under the company's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/about/hearing-aid-compatibility-us?srsltid=AfmBOooAvCUTnUIjfpLDo-1IO0Km211MEmedbfZkjh7owdvxIzjGFngF">Hearing Aid</a>" compatibility page. So, perhaps we're looking at an eventual U.S. market launch, but don't hold your breath.</p><p>Motorola's latest foldable duo launched this past June and the Plus edition continued the large cover display trend from 2023. The company improved its usefulness while also enhancing its cameras and software. With rumors suggesting this "S" variant of the flagship models could sit beneath them, it remains to be seen what we'll have to sacrifice.</p>

<ul><li>Android reactions now show up properly on iPhones, fixing a major messaging headache.</li><li>Previously, Android reactions would appear as separate messages, cluttering up chats—especially in group texts.</li><li>The update is part of RCS v2.7, but it’s unclear if Apple or Google made the change.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new update has finally closed the gap in cross-platform messaging, as Android reactions are now showing up properly on iPhones.</p><p>Previously, when an Android user reacted to a message from an iOS device, it would show up as a separate message with the emoji and the original text, making conversations messy. This was a major pain point for group chats with both Android and iOS users. But now, that’s finally a thing of the past.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290703/apple-green-bubble-message-reaction-rcs-android" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, emoji reactions now display correctly on both iOS and Android. In their test, they sent reactions between an iPhone running iOS 18.1 and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, and the reactions appeared correctly on both.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:373px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.48%;"><img id="tFPbr7BoNgqS6JQojKBLh8" name="RCS-messaging-on-iPhone.jpg" alt="RCS messaging reactions on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tFPbr7BoNgqS6JQojKBLh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="373" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Verge)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s still unclear whether Google or Apple is behind this fix. The feature comes with RCS v2.7, meaning Apple could have added support for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS standard</a> in iOS 18.1, or Google might’ve made changes behind the scenes to improve how iPhones handle emoji reactions from Android.</p><p>RCS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">made its global debut on iOS 18 in September</a>, bringing a much-improved cross-platform texting experience for both Android and iPhone users. With features like typing indicators, high-res image sharing, and more, texting across platforms just got a lot better.</p><p>The upgrade to RCS on Apple devices is unexpected. For years, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-should-be-ashamed-rcs-ios">pushed Apple to support RCS</a>, but Apple wasn’t budging. However, with pressure from the European Union and China, Apple had no choice but to finally make it happen.</p><p>While iPhones got RCS with iOS 18, here&apos;s the kicker—your carrier has to back it too. If they don’t, chats with Android users will just switch back to SMS. And even though iPhones are everywhere, many carriers outside the U.S. still don’t support RCS.</p><p>Nevertheless, this change definitely makes chatting with your Android-using friends more enjoyable and seamless. Messaging apps should just work and let you have a good time talking, no matter what phones you’ve got.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about how I hoped to see the Android equivalent of an iPad Mini. While we have plenty of options to choose from if you want a powerful tablet with a big screen, smaller tablets are usually packed with less-than-impressive specs. More recently, I've wondered whether a small and powerful Android tablet is really necessary, given that I always carry a foldable phone with me.</p><p>In terms of performance, foldables take the cake, and it's not even close. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> uses the 8 Gen 2, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> relies on the Tensor G4. Sure, the Pixel might fall short of the other two foldables I mentioned, but it's no slouch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BuVjgbdUTB9GY2EW9Jj6dF" name="lenovo-legion-y700-2024-promo-banner.jpg" alt="Lenovo Legion Y700 2024 promo banner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BuVjgbdUTB9GY2EW9Jj6dF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for tablets, there just aren't that many options if you want flagship specs but a screen under 10 inches. Lenovo is really the only game in town, as the Legion Y700 sports an 8.8-inch screen and is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. That presents a different problem, however, as the Y700 isn't officially sold in the States, meaning that you have to go through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giztop.com/lenovo-legion-y700-2024.html" target="_blank">Giztop</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-Lenovo-Legion-Y700.html" target="_blank">AliExpress</a> to get one.</p><p>The smallest flagship tablet that I've come across that is readily available, is the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a>. It too makes use of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but comes with a 10.9-inch screen. While Samsung ditched the 11-inch model with the Galaxy Tab S10, the Tab S9 and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is still available. But even then, we don't know how long that will be the case, and it's still too large.</p><p>All the while, foldable phones offer screens that fall right within the size range that I would want. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is one of the smaller ones with its 7.6-inch display, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review" target="_blank">Vivo X Fold 3 Pro</a> offers up an even larger 8.03-inch panel. Unfortunately, Vivo's foldable presents the same problem as the Y700, as you can't just pick it up in Best Buy or on Amazon.</p>

<p>With all of that being said, do I <em>really</em> need to jump through a bunch of hoops just to get a powerful tablet? Or are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> simply the better overall option for those who either have one or are considering one?</p><p>The short answer to this question should be fairly obvious. But there are a few wrinkles that have kept me from coming to a definitive conclusion.</p><p>Foldable phones are mostly the better option, simply because they're both a phone and a tablet in a single device. With the work that Samsung, Google, and OnePlus have been putting into the software, the experience is also largely the same between each company's foldable phone and tablet offerings.</p>

<p>The biggest difference comes in the form of multi-tasking, at least to a certain extent. Many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> and tablets include the ability to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">DeX Mode</a>, essentially turning your device into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>. However, unlike the Galaxy Tab S9 or Tab S10, the only way to use DeX on the Fold 6 is to either plug into an external display or connect to one wirelessly. Meanwhile, you can just tap a button on the Galaxy Tab keyboard and switch over from the traditional tablet interface to DeX mode.</p><p>This isn't the case when looking at the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">Pixel Tablet</a>. Even while running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta, I'm unable to do anything but mirror the screen from the 9 Pro Fold, which is simply disappointing. My disappointment is further compounded by the fact that you can use desktop windowing on an external display with the Pixel 9 Pro XL but not the Pro Fold.</p>
<p>On the bright side, after enabling the "Freeform windows" toggle in Developer Options, I can have up to four free-floating windows on the Pixel Tablet. Things work surprisingly well, and Google has done an excellent job of making things look more aesthetically pleasing than in the days of old. The only downside is that this isn't a feature that's enabled out of the box, but I expect that to change sooner rather than later.</p><p>Although OnePlus doesn't have a specific desktop mode for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">Pad 2</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, it has another trick up its sleeve. You can actually use your phone <em>from</em> the Pad 2, bringing Phone Mirroring to a tablet, which is something I didn't have on my bingo card. Much like the experience is largely the same with Samsung devices, the various features and multitasking options are pretty similar between the OnePlus Pad 2 and Open.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP" name="google-pixel-tablet-freeform-windows.jpg" alt="Freeform windows on the Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area where all of the tablets mentioned have an advantage is when using a stylus. Samsung includes one in the box, Google doesn't sell one at all but relies on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">USI 2.0</a> standard, and while OnePlus does offer one, you have to buy it separately. But that's not the advantage that I'm talking about.</p><p>Excluding the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which lacks stylus support, you'll have to contend with the crease on foldable phones. It's fine for the most part and is a lot better than it used to be, but the crease can still be a source of frustration. None of those problems exist with the slabs of glass on a tablet. Drawing a straight line is entirely dependent on your ability to actually draw a straight line.</p><p>On the flip side, you don't exactly want to whip out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> while you're waiting in line at the store and want to turn a picture into a meme. The same sentiment rings true even with the OnePlus Pad 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9</a>. Meanwhile, provided that you have the S Pen Fold Edition or Oppo Pen you can do exactly that with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 or OnePlus Open.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no arguing or denying that foldable phones are more versatile compared to the best Android tablets or even phones. However, there is one argument to be made, and it's the most important one of them all — price.</p><p>Without taking trade-ins or deals into consideration, you could import the 16GB/512GB model of the Lenovo Legion Y700 2024 from Giztop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giztop.com/lenovo-legion-y700-2024.html">for about $600</a>. Heck, you could even go so far as to toss in the official leather case, Legion Gaming Controller G7, and Lenovo's Stylus Pen, and you would be looking at around $760.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at $1,899, which includes 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you want to match up the storage, the 512GB model will set you back just north of $2,000. Samsung doesn't offer the Fold 6 with 16GB of RAM, and that doesn't include the S Pen or case. </p>

<p>You're looking at another $60 for just the stylus or $100 if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases">official S Pen case</a>. At that price, I could buy two Y700 tablets, complete with accessories, and still have money left over to snag a couple of different controllers or an external SSD to house my ROM collection. </p><p>Now, there's a good chance that you might be swayed into changing your mind in the very near future. The 2024 holiday shopping season is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-sale-top-android-deals-2024">already underway</a>, with Black Friday right around the corner. </p><p>If Prime Day was anything to go by, then I suspect that we'll see some pretty incredible deals pop up for both foldable phones and tablets. With that in mind, don't just jump at the first deal that you see just for the sake of it. Even still, I'm hoping to see some steep discounts on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">foldable phones</a>, but I suspect there will also be plenty of tablet deals to be had. </p><p>For as much as I want foldable phones to take over the world and replace the slabs of glass that we've been reliant on for years, we're just not there yet. Frankly, I don't know if we'll ever actually get there with book-style foldables as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> continue to rise in popularity.</p><p>Simply based on the price alone, and ignoring all of the convenience that foldables offer, tablets are still better. Now, I just need companies to release these small and powerful tablets in the U.S., so I don't have to pay extra just to get one imported.</p>
