<hr>
<p>All eyes are on the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which are going to debut at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made by Google event</a> next month. However, we could see a long-overdue revamp of Google&apos;s smart home offerings at the event as well. A recent leak by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1817682764595970361" target="_blank">Arsène Lupin on X (formerly Twitter)</a> reveals a ton of information about a Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). It would be the most expensive Nest thermostat ever, with a rumored $279 starting price. </p><p>The leak seems to be credible as it includes what looks to be official marketing and product images. It even includes a breakdown of how the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) compares to the existing Nest Thermostat. While both devices can be controlled remotely with the Google Home app, that&apos;s about where the differences end. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/vysHee05Kh<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1817682770144920057">July 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The highlight of this rumored refresh is a design overhaul that will make the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) a more premium product. There&apos;s a new borderless, high-resolution display that looks stunning in the leaked images. In fact, it looks quite like a blown-up Pixel Watch, and that&apos;s not a bad thing. The thermostat also features a stainless steel chassis, making it more attractive than the design of the Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) and the standard Nest Thermostat.</p><p>There are plenty of new software features, too. The Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) will offer a customizable home screen, so you can adjust the appearance of your digital display to your liking. The chart mentions a new feature called Dynamic Farsight that requires the Google Home app, and is presumably an iteration of the current Farsight functionality, which lets you see information at a glance.</p><p>Additionally, energy savings is once again a key selling point of the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). The product materials reference Adaptive Eco mode and Smart Schedules, both of which will help reduce power draw. There&apos;s also a System Health Monitor that could help you figure out if there is a problem with your heating or cooling systems. It&apos;ll work with Matter, too, as the unified smart home standard continues to grow and be adopted by manufacturers. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/geUXNsMwWH<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1817682779762508112">July 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>In the box, the images suggest you&apos;ll get a Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen), a trim plate, a thermostat base, a steel plate, a Nest Temperature Sensor (2nd gen), and mounting screws and wiring labels. </p><p>Overall, if this is the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen), it looks like a pretty compelling upgrade. The redesign matches modern design trends and looks excellent, and there are new features as well. The only sticking point may be the $279 starting price, but the current Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) retails for $250 at full price. </p><p>It&apos;s only a $30 increase over the existing model, but I&apos;ll be curious to see what sales and discounts will be available for the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). You can pick up a Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) for $170 right now, which is competitive. But it&apos;s important to remember that the Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) is already almost a decade old. I suspect people invested in the Nest ecosystem will be happy to see a new Nest Learning Thermostat at all, and won&apos;t get hung up on the pricing. </p>

<p>This leak only covers the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen), but I hope it&apos;s a preview of what could be coming at the Made by Google event next month. The entire Nest lineup has been neglected for the past few years, and it&apos;s time to change that. Sure, the Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) — which first released in 2015 — is one of the oldest products in the lineup, but it&apos;s not the only one to show its age. </p><p>In particular, I&apos;d like to see Google update the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max. The Nest Hub (2nd gen) released in 2021, and the Nest Hub Max was released in 2019. You might think that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> replaces both devices, but that certainly isn&apos;t the case. It&apos;s too expensive to <em>just</em> serve as a smart display — you need to make use of its tablet functionality to make it worthwhile. Plus, it&apos;s much harder to deck out your home with Pixel Tablet(s) than it is with Nest Hub(s) for a reasonable price. </p><p>It doesn&apos;t get better when you look at the Google Home and Google Home Mini. They were released in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Though they&apos;re cheap, that doesn&apos;t make up for their aging hardware and feature set. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest Audio</a> is a few years old, too. Up and down the Nest lineup, there are more products that need an update badly than there are ones that do not. </p><p>So, here&apos;s to hoping the Made by Google event brings a long-overdue refresh to the entire Nest lineup. If new products are announced, Google might be competitive in the smart home space again.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>On Thursday, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25023542-appeals-decision-blocking-fcc-reclassification-on-broadband">blocked the FCC&apos;s Title II reclassification of broadband services</a>, calling it "a major question requiring clear congressional authorization." </p><p>That&apos;s the news. The FCC had previously decided in early 2024 that broadband internet providers should be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/why-net-neutrality-is-so-important">classified as common carriers</a> like telephone providers (this has been flopped back and forth since 2005). Providers did not like the ruling and sought to have the decision blocked before it could come into effect. The 6th Circuit Court obliged in June, saying more time and input were needed to decide the merits of the appeal. This week, it was decided it didn&apos;t need that much time, and input wasn&apos;t needed after all, at least not immediately.</p><p>Nobody should be surprised that an appeals court made a decision without hearing oral arguments from one side because that&apos;s how America works. William Churchill once said, "Politics is not a game. It is an earnest business." Truer words were never spoken.</p>
<p>You have a side. I have a side. Everyone has to pick a side. Here&apos;s something to consider: neither side is right because laws are meant to serve the best interests of everyone. In a perfect world, partisan politics and lobbying efforts would be tossed aside while both sides worked together in the court to do what&apos;s best for all of us.</p><p>In the real world, telecom providers went to a partisan court with a request to help them. It&apos;s also an election year, which is likely why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-court-blocks-biden-administration-net-neutrality-rules-2024-08-01/#:~:text=The%20Sixth%20Circuit%20U.S.%20Court,effort%20to%20reinstate%20the%20rules.">oral arguments have been scheduled</a> for late October or early November—just ahead of the election—and blocking these changes hurts one side. Maybe the ruling is correct, and the FCC has no authority, and telecom providers should not have to follow these rules. Maybe not. I don&apos;t know because I&apos;m not a legal expert on this matter, and I was not allowed to listen to legal experts give any arguments on the matter, as was originally decided.</p>
<h2 id="regardless-of-what-side-you-apos-re-on-you-should-be-upset-2">Regardless of what side you&apos;re on, you should be upset</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="J2SRsSq6FRDrxy3LU7kfVg" name="congress-7srp.jpg" alt="Congress" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J2SRsSq6FRDrxy3LU7kfVg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Louis Velazquez)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I do know is that I&apos;m distrustful, and you should be too. If not for this decision, pick one you disagree with and distrust that one instead. That&apos;s a problem.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I see: a decision that favored one side was made. A group of judges heavily skewed toward the other side has blocked that decision, saying we need to know more. Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/02/harris-becomes-democratic-nominee/" target="_blank">Harris&apos; official nomination</a> has given <em>both</em> sides signs of life in the upcoming presidential election, knowing more isn&apos;t required, and it&apos;s just blocked for now. That&apos;ll show &apos;em.</p><p>I don&apos;t give a damn which side you&apos;re on, and you shouldn&apos;t give a damn which side I&apos;m on. You should be upset over what looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/fccs-net-neutrality-rules-blocked-by-sixth-circuit-judges">obvious partisan politics</a> interfering with a decision that is supposed to benefit us all.</p>
<p>Our government can not make everyone happy because that&apos;s impossible when we are so divided. What it can do is be transparent. In this case, we deserve to hear why the FCC&apos;s rules were good for us and why they were not. This issue affects us all. It is about our ability to be informed and how much it will hurt our wallets. Your side deserves a chance to convince people on the other side.</p><p>Ideally, we wouldn&apos;t be at each other&apos;s throats about everything. I shouldn&apos;t care if you don&apos;t like gay people as long as you don&apos;t infringe on their rights. I also shouldn&apos;t care if you don&apos;t want to bake them a damn cake because you don&apos;t support them. Nobody at any level of government should be trying to make me care, and news providers should differentiate between news and opinion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:768px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.85%;"><img id="QsHUz8V4MVfNtyR9NUCxu7" name="ATT-Flying-COW-5G-test.jpg" alt="AT&T's Flying COW provided 5G coverage to a field of cows" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QsHUz8V4MVfNtyR9NUCxu7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="768" height="475" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AT&T)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll do that again — the news is that the 6th Circuit has temporarily blocked the FCC reclassification of broadband providers, often called net neutrality.</p>
<p>My <strong>opinion</strong> is that it&apos;s all bullshit, and it looks like it was done to appease one bunch of loonies and defeat the other bunch of loonies. This happens when you let loonies appoint judges to lifetime appointments while having mechanisms in place to block those appointments until it&apos;s convenient for your side.</p>
<p>I try to stay out of politics because I hate dealing with lunatics. One side isn&apos;t going to agree with me. Respectful disagreement is cool, but unhinged lunacy is never far behind. I have better things to do than read the crap some internet asshole furiously shits out to share with everyone.</p><p>This time I&apos;ll make an exception, and I want to piss <strong>everyone</strong> off. Your side sucks. My side sucks. We should want to make individual decisions and not follow party lines so much, regardless of why we are told we need to do it. Net neutrality means your internet provider is gonna charge you more. It also means you&apos;re going to have better access to information and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">entertainment</a> without some mega-corporation deciding to screw it up. You didn&apos;t get to hear more from either party in this appeal.</p><p>You <strong>can</strong> ignore your side and think about what&apos;s right for you. So do it.</p>

Whether you have a phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">known for its amazing camera</a> or a trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phone</a>, the camera in your pocket is going to take great photos and videos when you use it. Tech is cool like that and average things today were incredible just a few years ago.</p><p>Do we <em>really</em> know how to use that camera? I don&apos;t mean knowing what all the settings and buttons can do; I mean having a handle on where and when we can film without any repercussions. I thought I did, but I had a lot to learn, and I recently learned more about public photography and privacy in one day than in 15 years of covering tech.</p>

<p>You might have seen videos from "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_audit">First Amendment Auditors</a>" on YouTube or TikTok — I spent an uncomfortable day at the post office with a group of them.</p><p>If you&apos;re not familiar with the term, First Amendment Auditors use their camera to exercise their First Amendment rights by taking video in public spaces like sidewalks, post offices, or other government spaces. I won&apos;t say anything about any agenda they may have because they each have their platform to explain themselves. I will say that they are very knowledgeable of the laws surrounding public photography, and most of us have a lot to learn about the whole mess they create. Some of them, like one of the people at this particular outing, are also in law school and know <em>exactly</em> what they can and can&apos;t do.</p>
<p>I was there just to observe because I was curious. I parked myself off to the side <em>without</em> my phone camera in my hands to see how people reacted to what surely felt like an invasion of their privacy. What I learned is that the rules and laws can confuse us because there&apos;s a difference between what is legal and what is right.</p>
<h2 id="the-nuances-of-filming-in-public-2">The nuances of filming in public</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3153px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.90%;"><img id="DDYZqXhJYtnNkTSPaj9LF8" name="mailbox.JPG" alt="A Spongebob mailbox" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DDYZqXhJYtnNkTSPaj9LF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3153" height="1794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>This article is going to be about rules and laws in the United States</strong>. Nothing here applies anywhere else, and if you&apos;re curious about filming in your country, I recommend you find a similar article written by someone more local with more knowledge. </p><p>In general, in the United States, if I am in a place I am allowed to be and can see it with my eyes, I can also photograph it. This is covered under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution</a>:</p><p><em>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</em></p>
<p>The freedom of the press portion is why this applies to people with cameras at the Post office. There is no such thing as a press pass under the law; we are all journalists with the ability and right to gather and distribute information and the powerful camera in our phone makes it easy to do. It&apos;s a good thing, and like all good things is easy to abuse.</p><p>The confusion comes from our perceptions of privacy. When out in public, you have zero reasonable expectations of privacy. That means people will see you, will see what you are doing, and will film you doing it if they desire.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.17%;"><img id="g6MGRjjbWMDgmCZytfBmn5" name="arlo-video-doorbell-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Arlo Video Doorbell Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g6MGRjjbWMDgmCZytfBmn5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="470" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Arlo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You are filmed every day you leave your house. Consumer products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ring-video-doorbell-4-review">video doorbells</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/its-impossible-to-review-security-cameras-in-the-age-of-breaches-and-ransomware">security cameras</a> are filming you, cameras are mounted on the outside of the grocery store or the gas station, and even cars film you as they drive by. Cameras are also inside the places you visit and in some states can also record audio.</p><p>First Amendment Auditors often remind you of this and tell you that you have no right to privacy. They&apos;re correct — the Bill of Rights offers us privacy protections from the government (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">Fourth</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/">Fifth</a> Amendments) but not from ourselves. You might hate this — I do — but feelings aren&apos;t laws. If we had a right to privacy and filming us required some sort of permission or a signed release, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/can-sentry-mode-record-continuously.294436/">Elon Musk would be in jail</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, there are nuances to public filming laws. In some cases, intent matters; if you take creepy shots of underage girls and then post them to the internet, you probably will get in trouble (thankfully) because of your intent. But if you take photos and videos of underage girls sitting on a bench and share them as news with no ill intent, you&apos;re not breaking the law. Wiretapping laws and things like two-party consent can also matter for filming inside businesses, even if it&apos;s the business owner doing the filming.</p><p>In the U.S., states can afford us more rights than the Constitution provides, and things like using a long pole to film over a fence or flying a drone into someone&apos;s backyard can be illegal. Unless you&apos;re afforded these special rights by the state, it&apos;s really trivial to film you almost anywhere.</p>
<p>First Amendment Auditors know about these nuances and take the time to learn the laws before they go somewhere to practice their rights. If there is any question about the law, an attorney will be promptly consulted. I&apos;m sure what they are doing is lucrative and profitable, so it&apos;s worth the costs to push the envelope.</p><p>I&apos;m going to assume that most of us aren&apos;t really interested in traveling the U.S. to film post offices or the DMV and just want to use our cameras to take great pics and videos of the things around us. We still need to understand where and when we can do it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="4yqBQ8Z9sspt68aFHzTPDC" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-versus-camera-sample-4.jpg" alt="A crowd in a building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4yqBQ8Z9sspt68aFHzTPDC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That gets a little dicey when it comes to those odd encounters that can happen. If we see people in conflict situations or polar bears chasing penguins, we naturally want to film it. We&apos;re wired that way and people love a spectacle. It&apos;s why entities like TMZ exist.</p><p>You should definitely know the exact laws about photography in the location where you want to use a camera, but some general rules are easy to remember and <em>usually</em> apply.</p>
<h2 id="defining-quot-public-quot-and-quot-intent-quot-can-be-tricky-2">Defining "public" and "intent" can be tricky</h2>
<p><strong>Public means a few different things</strong>. Some places, like the sidewalk, are public. You can be there, and you can film anything your eyes (or a telephoto lens) can see. Other places, like government buildings, have publicly accessible spaces like lobbies where you can film, and other places aren&apos;t publicly accessible.</p><p>Things can be interesting when <strong>public and private intersect</strong>. Walmart is a private business that is open to the public. You&apos;re not breaking any laws if you film someone acting a fool in Walmart, but Walmart <em>can</em> ask you to stop, just like you <em>can</em> say no because using your camera is not against the law, just Walmart&apos;s policy. In turn, Walmart can ask you to leave their private business, and if you don&apos;t, law enforcement will become involved in escorting you out and serving you with a trespass notice.</p>
<p><strong>Intent is a complicated concept</strong> that usually requires a judge or jury to decide. I have a real-life example where intent decided the outcome. At a music festival, I noticed a man using his phone to film a friend breastfeeding her child. I confronted him, lost my temper, and knocked his phone out of his hand, damaging it.</p><p>I was cited for assault and battery, and he was cited for harassment. County attorneys declined to file charges against me, but I was forced to reimburse him for his damaged property. No charges were filed against him because breastfeeding is a "natural and wholesome activity" (I agree), and ill intent could not be proven. Taking photos of women at the beach, little kids at the playground, or a mother breastfeeding her child is not illegal unless the photos or video are used in a "bad" way.</p><p>I&apos;d do it again, but I would know I was in the wrong for doing it unless I could prove he had bad intentions.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-do-if-you-apos-re-being-filmed-2">What can you do if you&apos;re being filmed?</h2>
<p>Another thing to consider is what you can do if you&apos;re the one being filmed. You may have no right to privacy but you have the right to try and create it. That means stupid things like never leaving your house or wearing a disguise while out in public, but it also means being aware of your surroundings and taking precautions.</p><p><strong>It is legal for me to take a video of you entering your PIN at an ATM as long as I am where I am allowed to be</strong>. Doing something illegal with that information is different than witnessing it. This sucks because it <em>shouldn&apos;t</em> be legal, but it is. This also applies to someone getting in close to see what&apos;s on your phone&apos;s screen while you&apos;re using it to put in your password somewhere or if you&apos;re messaging someone. Keep this in mind and protect your privacy in case someone is invading it. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ferilinso-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Accessories/dp/B0CNRLPVFN?th=1">privacy screen protectors</a> can help, but being aware of what&apos;s around you is the best way to safeguard your privacy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also need to know that in many places, you can not interfere with someone "exercising their First Amendment rights" by filming. Harassing them or otherwise impeding their filming can get you a charge. As much as you might hate this idea — I certainly do — a person with a camera has the same rights afforded to them as you do.</p><p>You also do not have to sign any form of release for someone to take photos or video of you unless it&apos;s being used for commercial purposes. That means I do need your permission to use you in a commercial or to endorse a product on TikTok. <strong>I do not need your permission</strong> to post monetized videos on social platforms if you&apos;re in them.</p>
<p><strong>The most important thing is to be respectful to each other</strong>. You can&apos;t stop me from filming you while you&apos;re at the post office or sitting at a sidewalk table eating lunch. The <em>best</em> thing that could happen is for me to be respectful and to stop filming you. The next best thing is for you to ignore me or to leave without causing a problem. It&apos;s tempting to yell at or do something even worse, but it&apos;s unwise — it could lead to legal troubles or just make you look unhinged on social media.</p><p>It might sound like I hate those guys at the post office taking videos of everyone, but I don&apos;t. I love what they have the right to do, but I dislike the way they go about doing it. I also understand that rights can be uncomfortable, and while I wasn&apos;t taking videos or spouting off laws and Constitutional Amendments, nobody wanted to see me in the corner associating with "those guys," and I felt bad doing it. </p><p>Knowing "the rules" when it comes to using your phone&apos;s camera is important. You should be able to film important things, and you get to decide what is important to you. You also don&apos;t want to end up in the back of a patrol car because you weren&apos;t aware of the laws themselves. </p><p>But maybe we should also consider how others feel when it comes to whipping out your camera.</p>

While you might expect the "Plus" to mean there&apos;s a larger display, it actually refers to the spec bump provided by the new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro. The phone also comes standard with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, the upper configurations of the original Nothing Phone 2a.</p><p>Otherwise, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is nearly identical to its non-Plus sibling, including the toned down Glyph lights on the back, dual 50MP cameras, and 6.7-inch OLED display. One notable upgrade is the 50MP selfie camera, up from 32MP.</p><p>The Plus side (pun intended) is that the phone only costs $399, which could make it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">best Android phones under $400</a>. The downside is that interested buyers in the United States need to purchase the device through a beta program, just like with the Nothing Phone 2a.</p>

The feature is more or less an easy way to access Google Lens, and while it&apos;s been limited to Pixel and Samsung phones, Google is expanding the feature to the Chrome browser on desktops.</p><p>Officially called "Drag to Search," the feature works fairly similarly but is a little less fluid. According to 9to5Google, who spotted the feature, users can access Drag to Search by clicking the Lens icon in the address bar of their desktop Chrome browser. They&apos;ll then select something on the screen by moving the cursor to highlight the area.

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Pixel phones have great-looking displays with crisp colors and inky blacks, but users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a> may not find them so appealing with the relatively low flicker rate. However, there&apos;s a neat trick that users can implement that increases the PWM rate of the Pixel display, making it less nauseating to look at in certain conditions.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Phones editor, Nick Sutrich, says that thanks to the trick, he&apos;s "been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> at 3840Hz for five days with no negative health symptoms." Previously, he could only use a Pixel phone for about 30 minutes before needing a break.</p><p>That&apos;s a huge win for people who are sensitive to these types of displays, but the downside is that in order to implement the change, you&apos;ll need to root your Pixel, which is not for the faint of heart. But if you <em>do</em> decide to try it out, read the article in the link above to see how Sutrich made it work for him.</p>

One UI 7 was expected to appear in beta form on July 29, but the day came and went without any exciting news. Instead, we got reports that it has likely been delayed as Samsung works out the kinks in the software (but isn&apos;t that what a beta is all about?).</p><p>Based on leaks and rumors, One UI 7 will reportedly see quite a refresh, adopting some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">iOS-like cues</a>, particularly when it comes to the app icons and quick settings panel.

<p>In addition to the Pixel smartphone colors, we also got a look at some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> specs and features. Apparently, the watch will have a much brighter display at 2,000 nits and faster charging than before, although battery life appears to be about the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>It also looks like you&apos;ll be able to view your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review">Nest Doorbell</a> live feed straight from your watch, and there will apparently be some advanced running metrics, including something called "Cardio Load." It sounds like Google is setting its sights on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a> with the Pixel Watch 3, but with the battery life claims, it may still fall short.</p>

<p>Lastly, we got a look at what appears to be a new Google TV streaming device, aptly named "Google TV Streamer." Aside from the rather creative name, the device looks like a drastic change from the Chromecast with Google TV dongles, adopting a slim set-top box design. And while we don&apos;t know much about the device like power and storage, the remote is also receiving some changes with button placement, including a new mute button and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tvs-magic-button-debuts-launching-any-app-of-your-choice">Magic button</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when this device will launch, but given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made by Google event</a> is happening on August 13, it seems likely it may appear on or around that time.</p>

<p>AT&T is offering the 2024 Motorola Razr Plus for just $5.99 per month on qualifying unlimited plans, and that's not even with a trade-in. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-vs-razr-plus-2023">Compared to the 2023 Razr Plus</a>, the 2024 version features a wide range of improvements, including the battery life, the cameras, the cover screen, and a better-built hinge.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you liked past generations of the Motorola Razr; you value having a phone with a large, useful cover screen; you&apos;re looking for a well-designed flip phone that&apos;s comfortable to hold in both positions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d prefer a phone with an ultrawide lens over one with a telephoto lens; you aren&apos;t looking for a flip phone; you don&apos;t have AT&T and aren&apos;t willing to switch.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Motorola Razr Plus</a> comes out swinging as what&apos;s likely the new industry standard for flip phones, giving the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip series a run for its money. Most of all, we love this new generation for its huge 4-inch cover screen, which is more useful than those of its peers and past generations. The main screen measures 6.9 inches, and both offer bright, vivid displays. The new Razr Plus also features 256GB of storage, 12GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip.</p><p>This phone also includes a super powerful suite of camera lenses, though some were sad to see the ultrawide switched out with a telephoto lens. In any case, it&apos;s hard to go wrong at just $5.99 a month, especially considering it retails for $999.99 normally.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing is rolling out its first update for the Phone 2a Plus, which is a device that pushes its internal hardware more than the original iteration.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich spotted the update on his device earlier today (August 2) with a 768MB size. Despite the download, Nothing&apos;s first update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a> is rather light, only fixing a few problems users may find useful.</p><p>The patch notes are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Improved the speed of cold starting the camera app.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing the hotspot access point to default to 2.4G but show as 5G.</li><li>Resolved various system crashes.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing some cloned apps to not respond to auto-rotate.</li><li>Other bug fixes and general improvements.</li></ul>

<p>With the update appearing early this morning, it&apos;s likely users should begin noticing it slowly today (August 2) and beyond.</p><p>U.S. consumers are still waiting for a chance to snag a Nothing Phone 2a Plus following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">its overseas launch</a> a couple of days ago. That&apos;ll happen on August 7 when consumers can purchase the device through the U.S. Beta Program for $399 in gray. The Phone 2a Plus looks identical to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">the regular 2a</a> that debuted in March but features new color selections.</p><p>But what really sets this device apart is its internal components, specifically the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor and the upgraded 50MP front-facing camera.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a Plus is the world&apos;s first device to rock the chipset, which focuses on entertainment (think games). Based on advanced TSMC 4nm Gen 2 technology, the chipset provides the Phone 2a Plus with a 10% performance boost over the Phone 2a.</p><p>With Nothing OS 2.6 at its core, the Phone 2a Plus features a richer symbiosis between the company&apos;s software and AI. The device now offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/13842-extra-power-extra-pixels-extra-unique-phone-2a-plus">daily news digest widget</a>, backed by AI, to deliver news to users in a "simple and intuitive format."</p>

As is the case with pretty much every new Samsung phone, there are so many features that it&apos;s enough to make your head spin. Whether this is your first foldable or if you&apos;re an experienced veteran, here are the first things you should do with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p>

<p>One of the best things about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is that Samsung has yet to bring the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Instead, the scanner is actually embedded in the Side button, making it easy to quickly unlock your phone. However, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 also includes Face unlock, which could come in handy in a pinch, despite it not being as secure as using a fingerprint. </p>

<p>For whatever reason, Samsung still ships its phones with the navigation bar enabled. This is fine for some, but gesture navigation is arguably a much better experience.

<p>Although one of the bigger upgrades with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is its IP54 rating, that won&apos;t save your phone if you accidentally drop it. Just like the rest of your technology, we recommend keeping it as protected as possible. Despite sporting a slightly tweaked design, there are still a plethora of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases">Galaxy Z Fold 6 cases</a> to choose from. </p><p>Currently, our favorite is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinborne-Compatible-Magnetic-Minimalist-Textures/dp/B0D7C2QSCP/">Thinborne Aramid Fiber case</a>, as it&apos;s extremely thin and feels great in the hand. Plus, it makes it so that your Galaxy Z Fold 6 is compatible with MagSafe accessories. That last part is especially important as we&apos;re still waiting for Samsung (and others) to adopt the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">Qi2 standard</a>. </p>

It can be a bit awkward trying to draw a diagram using just your finger, not to mention the precision offered by using a stylus over your built-in digits. </p><p>There are a couple of options to choose from, as Samsung is continuing to sell the S Pen Fold Edition. This is a stylus that&apos;s designed for the Galaxy Z Fold series and was updated last year. However, there&apos;s also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-s-pen-pro-vs-s-pen-fold-edition">S Pen Pro</a>, which supports the Galaxy Z Fold 6, along with any other Samsung device that sports S Pen compatibility. </p>

<p>If you want to get really technical, you <em>could</em> consider the Galaxy Z Fold 6 as being two different phones in one. While this is great, it also means that your home screen layouts won&apos;t be uniform between the Cover and Main screens. Thanks to Cover Screen Mirroring, that&apos;s no longer an issue, as everything will be the same between both screens. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Home screen</strong>. </p><p>3. At the top of the page, tap <strong>Cover screen mirroring</strong>. </p>

<p>For the sake of continuity, Samsung also makes it so that you can keep using an app, even if you fold the phone. By default, if you&apos;re using an app on the main screen and then close the Fold 6, the app is also closed. This means that you have to go and open the app again, which could be quite a bit frustrating. </p><p>That&apos;s no longer an issue, provided that you first enable this feature. Improving things even more is that Samsung lets you pick and choose which apps you want to have this feature available for. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Display</strong>. </p><p>3. Tap <strong>Continue apps on cover screen</strong>. </p>

<p>While Samsung throws everything but the kitchen sink into the Settings app by default, there&apos;s actually quite a bit more that you can do. Good Lock has been a staple on practically every compatible Samsung phone that has come across our desks for years. </p><p>Although it&apos;s not installed by default, you can download the Good Lock app from the Galaxy Store on your Fold 6. Then, jump through the different options and install the modules that you think would be helpful. It truly does take your Samsung phone to the next level. </p>

<p>Despite foldable phones being around for the better part of five years and the likes of Samsung and Google making big strides on the software side, not every app supports the form factor. This means that you might end up using an app that doesn&apos;t take advantage of the entire screen, resulting in pillar boxes being placed on either side. </p><p>To combat this problem, Samsung has implemented an option that lets you pick the aspect ratio for your apps. In many cases, this forces the app to use the entire screen. However, you can also choose either 16:9 or 4:3 if you prefer the way an app looks in those aspect ratios. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Display</strong>. </p><p>3. Tap <strong>Full screen apps</strong>. </p>

<ul><li>Google details its coming parental feature for "select" Android devices, tablets, and Samsung Galaxy watches known as "School Time."</li><li>Parents can set the days, times, and apps their child can use during School Time, locking the rest of the device away until after.</li><li>Google is also introducing some additional "safety settings" for all users under 18 that can give a little peace of mind.</li><li>The company recently started rolling Gemini availability out to teen users following its 1.5 Flash model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With back-to-school looming, Google is detailing a new feature for Android that helps give parents peace of mind about their child and their phone.</p><p>Arriving for select Android phones, tablets, and Samsung Galaxy Watches is Google&apos;s latest highlighted feature "School Time." In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/families/android-update-school-time-parental-controls/">Keyword post</a>, School Time plays off a feature Fitbit rolled out for the Ace LTE devices that helps parents limit the screen time available for their child&apos;s phone.</p><p>Parents can set a start and end time for the school feature alongside the days it should be active.</p><p>When School Time is active, your child&apos;s device will be locked down. Parents can leverage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">Family Link</a> to set what apps their kids can use during learning hours. Your child can tap the "available apps" button to see a comprehensive list of what&apos;s useable at the time.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google to find out which specific devices are receiving this feature and will update this post when more information becomes available.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.37%;"><img id="omSmi6wXZTSk4bPEYcmb9i" name="google-school-time-parental-android-feature.jpg" alt="Google announced "School Time," a parental to help keep your child on track during learning hours." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/omSmi6wXZTSk4bPEYcmb9i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Parents can also set a specific list of contacts their child can text or call when School Time is enabled once the time to return begins. School Time will roll out on select devices "over the next year."</p><p>Additionally, Google highlighted a few extra parental tools that can be used as styles and rules change with your child&apos;s growth. Parents and teens will soon be able to link their accounts so the former can see the latter&apos;s watch history. This is on tap to roll out "later this summer." Family Link&apos;s scope is expanding to encompass teens to let parents limit their exposure to certain apps or products.</p><p>All users under 18 will have "safety settings" in place. This means SafeSearch will be enabled and auto-play on YouTube will be turned off.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-flash-model-access-expands">announced its 1.5 Flash model</a> for Gemini in late July, which boasted more accuracy and quicker response times. That debut was joined by the company&apos;s expansion of its AI bot to teen users and the school system. Those at least 13 years old can utilize Gemini&apos;s smarts when searching for information for papers or help with math homework.</p><p>Similar to its new safety settings for those under 18, Gemini&apos;s availability to teen users comes with a set of guardrails. Gemini won&apos;t expose such users to "inappropriate content" when answering questions. Gemini will also display chips — pop-up buttons that contain context-sensitive information — following AI responses so users can fact-check them.</p>

<ul><li>Citing a Samsung insider, a report claims the company's leadership is furious with its recent products and the close design language to Apple.</li><li>The MX Division's chairman, Lee Jae-yong, has reportedly become "angry," making situations "tense" at Samsung following criticism from the media and consumers.</li><li>The other side of the chairman's anger is the latest bout of product quality problems hitting the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, prompting an immediate halt on all shipments.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Problems have reportedly started rising internally at Samsung, particularly with its MX Division responsible for mobile devices and wearables.</p><p>The reports from a supposed Samsung insider speaking with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ajunews.com/view/20240801110154499#ADN">Aju News</a> (Korean) suggest the division&apos;s chairman, Lee Jae-yong, has become upset with their design direction. The issues stem from the latest Galaxy Buds 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. It&apos;s not hiding that these devices echo Apple&apos;s AirPods and Watch Ultra in a few ways, which is where these rumors start.</p><p>The company insider claimed, "the chairman himself stepped in after the controversy over Apple&apos;s design plagiarism and quality issues surrounding the Buds 3 series and Galaxy Watch 7 released last month." They added, "the internal atmosphere is currently very bad."</p><p>The MX Division chairman&apos;s frustrations are reportedly rooted in the various rounds of criticism Samsung has received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">post-Unpacked</a>.</p><p>The publication explains that when visiting a Samsung Store in Hongdae (Seoul, South Korea), many said the products were "the same as Apple." Another instance supposedly involved a Samsung Store employee stating, "you might feel that it&apos;s similar to the Apple Watch Ultra" about the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>Chairman Lee&apos;s frustrations continue with the recent product quality issues Samsung&apos;s devices have experienced. Not only have the Buds 3 been recalled for another round of quality assurance, but the company has been forced to either "exchange" or "refund" consumers their money.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tBtk7MD44sf9bYHJz4qsRM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-3-vs-pro-close-06.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBtk7MD44sf9bYHJz4qsRM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro, it&apos;s clear that Apple was a source of inspiration for Samsung. With a stem design instead of the round, bulbous look of Galaxy Buds past, Samsung encroached on Apple&apos;s territory. Whether this was in the name of competition or not, the Korean brand&apos;s leadership is <em>not </em>pleased.</p><p>From the design of the buds to the case, the Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro are very <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-airpods-android-device">AirPod reminiscent</a>.</p><p>Shortly after Unpacked, user reports flooded Samsung&apos;s official channels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-delays-galaxy-buds-3-pro-shipments">with problems</a> regarding the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Reports varied from the buds being two different heights to LED issues and problems with the in-ear silicon tearing quite easily. The issues were unsightly and Samsung quickly halted all Galaxy Buds 3 Pro shipments until it could conduct a full quality sweep.</p><p>The other side of this is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. An "Ultra" model watch is something Apple has done for a while and typically offers a bulkier appearance than the standard model. Samsung did the same, and while the watch&apos;s body may differentiate itself, the orange, rocky band and button scream Apple.</p><p>With South Korean users and Samsung&apos;s leadership upset, it&apos;ll be interesting to see what happens this time next year.</p>
