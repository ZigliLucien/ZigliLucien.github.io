<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out a bunch of new security features for its Messages app that use on-device AI to fend off spam, shady links, and other digital junk.</p><p>As part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">top messaging app</a> picked up some upgraded scam detection, zeroing in on catching fake delivery and job offer scams.</p><p>If it detects a potential scam, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> will either toss it into the spam folder or alert you with a warning. It uses on-device machine learning to catch these tricks while keeping your chats private, according to the search giant's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. This update is currently being tested by beta users who have activated the spam protection feature.</p><p>Next up, Google is rolling out smart alerts for potentially risky links. These malicious URLs can cause serious trouble, from installing harmful software to sending users to fake phishing sites.</p><p>The messaging app will alert users when they get links from unknown sources and filter out messages with such links. Currently, Google is testing this feature with users in India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, with plans to roll it out globally later this year.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that while many scam texts come from abroad, they’re not all international. Google has revealed that users will soon be able to automatically hide messages from international senders not in their contacts. Those messages will go straight to the "Spam & blocked" folder. This feature is currently being tested in Singapore and will roll out to more countries soon.</p><p>The latest safety upgrades also bring smart alerts that automatically blur nudity in images. If users try to share explicit content, they'll get a warning about the potential risks. This feature will be enabled by default for users under 18, while adults will have to opt in via the Android settings.  This update is expected to roll out in the coming months for Android devices running version 9 or later.</p><p>Scammers don’t only rely on international numbers; they often impersonate real businesses or even friends. To combat these tricks, the Messages app is launching a contact verification system that uses each contact's public key to confirm their identity, checking sender credentials via a QR code or registered phone number.</p><p>Let’s hope Google speeds up the rollout of these new features. After all, over a billion people are counting on Google Messages to keep their daily chats flowing, as per the company.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> blew us away when it was unveiled a few years ago, and it still impresses in 2024 with efficient Tensor G2 performance, some fun camera features, and OS updates through October 2025. It may not be the newest kid on the block any more, but if you want a smartphone for under 500 bucks, this deal on the Pixel 7 Pro is an awesome choice. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCQVFQHD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="729fcdbc-7457-448c-8b51-79cb7d03a35a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>That&apos;s a truly remarkable discount on a device that we considered to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> that money can buy back in 2022. While the Pixel 7 Pro has since been replaced by newer models, it&apos;s got a larger AMOLED display than the similarly-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, plus awesome cameras, the still-capable Tensor G2 chipset, and software support through October 2025, at least.</p><p>The only issue with buying the Pixel 7 Pro in 2024 is that you won&apos;t get as many OS and security updates as you would with a newer phone, and that curved screen that Google later abandoned may not be for everyone. It&apos;s also worth noting that this discount is coming from a third-party seller at Amazon, so I can see it disappearing shortly after I hit that Publish button.</p><p>Still, the Pixel 7 Pro has stood the test of time and will likely go down in the smartphone history books as one of the best phones that Google ever produced. Getting your hands on one of these devices for under $500 seems like a no-brainer, and it isn&apos;t even Black Friday yet.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-black-friday-samsung-deals-2">Which retailer has the best Black Friday Samsung deals?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you&apos;re looking for! Pretty much every retailer under the sun will be launching holiday sales as we approach Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, so you&apos;ll want to be vigilant and look around before committing to one retailer (or you could simply bookmark Androidcentral.com for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">comprehensive deal coverage</a>). </p><p>That being said, if you are hoping to buy unlocked Samsung devices, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart will probably be your best bet. If you&apos;re willing to make a trade-in or update your wireless service, consider checking with your phone carrier or Samsung itself to see what offers are available. </p>
<h2 id="should-i-shop-on-black-friday-or-cyber-monday-xa0-2">Should I shop on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? </h2>
<p>The biggest discounts on devices such as smartphones, TVs, and video game consoles usually go live on Black Friday, while Cyber Monday is typically a better time to purchase smaller items like accessories and smart home tech. With that being said, some devices will sell out before Monday hits, so don&apos;t wait to buy if something catches your eye. </p>

<h2 id="when-will-black-friday-sales-start-2">When will Black Friday sales start?</h2>
<p>Although no retailers are naming it as such, the Black Friday sales have pretty much already begun. In the coming days, you&apos;ll see retailers across the web launching sales to get shoppers ready for the holiday season — the big question is whether these offers will improve as we near November 29th. Needless to say, if you&apos;re looking for a Samsung deal this holiday season, bookmark this page: I&apos;ll keep updating this guide with new offers as they go live. </p>
<h2 id="what-samsung-deals-can-i-expect-during-black-friday-2">What Samsung deals can I expect during Black Friday?</h2>
<p>If Amazon&apos;s recent Prime Day sale (aka Big Deal Days) is any indication, you can expect the return of record-breaking discounts on the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, and the latest lineup of Samsung smartwatches. Samsung smart TVs are also likely to receive some major discounts, and if we&apos;re lucky, we might see the first batch of price drops on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and Galaxy Tab S10 series of tablets. </p>

With an upcoming software update, Instant Translate could gain full feature parity with the regular Google Translate mode.</p><p>The feature was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-translate-richer-seamless-instant-translate-apk-teardown-3492801/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, who demonstrated the new Instant Translate functionality in the YouTube video below.</p>

<p>The changes were picked up in Android Authority's teardown of the APK for <strong>v8.20.71.687383449.1</strong> of the Google Translate app. While there's no guarantee that this functionality will be released to the public, it's clear that Google is testing big changes to Instant Translate. After the team at Android Authority managed to activate the feature, they saw all the Google Translate UI elements in Instant Translate mode. </p><p>When you use the default Google Translate mode in the mobile app, you have a lot of features at your fingertips. You can translate text, of course, but the user interface packs many more tools. For starters, the output can be spoken and copied. There will also be definitions and grammar suggestions that will help you understand the way words and phrases differ across languages.</p><p>The unfortunate part of using Instant Translate is that all these tools go away when this mode is activated. It'll convert text from one language to another as you type in real-time, but the above actions — from speaking to copying — are unavailable until you exit Instant Translate. That is, for now. The upcoming version of the Google Translate app could bring all the above functionality to Instant Translate mode, making it one of the best ways to use the app. </p><p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes to Instant Translate are available to users of the Google Translate app soon. In addition to the new functionality for Instant Translate, the report notes that Google Translate may add the ability to recover a recently deleted translation. </p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced new Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite platforms with Oryon CPU tech and 3X/ 12X CPU and AI performance over previous versions.</li><li>Snapdragon Cockpit Elite enables AI tricks like an LLM assistant trained on the car manual and zonal audio.</li><li>Ride Elite supports up to 40 cameras and sensors at once for self-driving cars, plus behavior-learning tech to take automatic actions based on your preferences.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Whether or not you have any interest in owning or riding in a self-driving car, Qualcomm says that its automaker clients want to pack their cars with more AI technology. With its new Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite, the company is promising ambitious, futuristic AI capabilities that hover between exciting and science-fiction.</p><p>Available starting in 2025, the 2nd-gen Cockpit Elite uses the same Oryon CPU tech found in its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> CPUs—which were announced yesterday at the Qualcomm Summit—with 3X the CPU performance of the last Snapdragon Cockpit. It also sports a Hexagon NPU with 12X-boosted AI and an Adreno GPU capable of supporting an absurd 16 4K displays simultaneously in one car, as well as "real-time ray tracing" and "immersive 3D experiences" for "critical visual information."</p><p>I asked the Qualcomm team why any car would need that much graphical power; they explained that this allows your car's infotainment display to span the entire front dashboard while still leaving processing power for TVs on seatbacks for passengers and graphical augmentations on your side mirrors.</p><p>Presumably, non-autonomous vehicles wouldn't need as many distracting screens, but luxury automakers would have that option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DZHqzrNr8zvEkHstLNKj9" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-cockpit-elite-zonal-audio" alt="Graphic showing "AI-enabled zonal audio" and what the Snapdragon Cockpit/ Ride Elite SoC looks like." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DZHqzrNr8zvEkHstLNKj9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The boosted CPU supports simultaneous tasks like navigation, music, calling, and gaming simultaneously. But the flashy star of Cockpit Elite, unsurprisingly, is the AI tech.</p><p>Qualcomm says its Hexagon NPU is "built to handle Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters." Each car's specific hands-free assistant would be trained on the car's manual so you could, for example, ask what a warning light means.</p><p>Snapdragon Cockpit Elite would also "learn and adapt to your preferences," Qualcomm claims, and even "take actions automatically." This part of the presentation felt looser on hard details; I asked what exact preferences the AI could learn, and heard examples like your car routing you home without your input if you usually do so at that time. It could also recognize which backup route you like to take during heavy traffic, or guide another driver (like your spouse) towards your usual parking spot.</p><p>In addition, Snapdragon Elite would recognize the number of passengers and change its usual patterns accordingly, like preventing phone notifications if someone else could hear them or using "zonal audio" to localize relevant audio to the driver while focusing on music for the passengers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kctCsTVt8Fnsnbcj6JLdG" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-ride-elite-ai" alt="An explainer slide showing how AI tech would work in a car for Snapdragon Ride Elite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kctCsTVt8Fnsnbcj6JLdG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon Ride Elite, which essentially pairs with Cockpit Elite as a single SoC for self-driving cars.</p><p>Ride Elite supports up to 40 sensors, including multiple 16MP cameras with 360º FoV and passenger-facing infrared cameras. It's meant to capture signs, lanes, and objects clearly, as well as recognize passenger gestures.</p><p>It simultaneously supports radar/lidar point-cloud processing, automotive security when parked, and other behavioral AI tricks like auto-rerouting around accidents, self-guided parking, and opening your sunroof depending on the weather.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1668px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.12%;"><img id="usTR5AxzY3vLupqkWqjPwB" name="Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Snapdragon Ride Elite Infographic" alt="An infographic showing how the Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite compare against the 1st-gen "non-Elite" models for CPU, GPU, NPU, and other features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usTR5AxzY3vLupqkWqjPwB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1668" height="936" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All combined, the Qualcomm Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite seem to promise smarts that are good enough to power the talking AI car from Knight Rider. We'll have to see how much a powerful SoC like this costs, both for automakers and for consumers, and whether the ambitious AI promises actually lead to helpful automation for drivers.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube Music could be working on support for clamshell foldable phones to refine its user experience.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-now-playing-widget-galaxy-z-flip-cover-display-apk-teardown-3492702/">Android Authority</a>, the YouTube Music mobile app&apos;s latest version (v7.24.51) holds clues that point toward a "FlipWidgetProvider." The publication conducted an APK teardown of the app and found a string that directly mentions a widget for a "flip" device, which is reportedly confirmed to be Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p>The post states the app&apos;s code shows that the "music player" widget can be enabled via <strong>Settings > Cover Screen > Widgets </strong>once YouTube rolls it out. Users may find this useful as such a widget isn&apos;t supported on the Flip series. However, it <em>is </em>on your standard slab phone like the Galaxy S24 series for the home screen. The widget gives options like play/pause, skip forward/back, and thumbs up/down options.</p><p>With its expected arrival on the Flip series&apos; cover display, users can have enhanced access to their music <em>without </em>opening the phone. Considering the size of the Galaxy Z Flip cover display, this widget will give users more mileage. Speaking of, it&apos;s unclear which devices will grab YouTube Music&apos;s widget support.</p><p>The widget will likely debut on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>; however, it&apos;s unclear how far back Samsung is willing to go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hTUG84r5j64bMjQgCgnSjF" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-apps.jpg" alt="Apps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTUG84r5j64bMjQgCgnSjF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung dubbed the larger screen of its Flip series the "Flex Window" when the Flip 5 launched in 2023. It was clear from the beginning that the "window" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">needed to be more flexible</a>. Users couldn&apos;t open any app they wanted on the cover display. Samsung implemented a "curated, optimized experience," limiting your options. Originally, the Flip 5&apos;s cover screen supported the following apps: Google Messages, Samsung Messages, WhatsApp, YouTube, Netflix, and Google Maps.</p><p>The ability to open more apps was tucked behind Samsung&apos;s Good Lock app launcher. The launcher gave users control over almost every app they had. This YouTube Music widget with Flex Window support will likely give users a more refined music control experience.</p><p>In other news, YouTube Music was busy rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">a Gemini Extension</a> for desktop and Android users. Users will find a series of suggested commands for the AI for music lookup, album discovery, or specific radio genre. After Gemini locates the song, users are thrown into YouTube Music for the playback or continuous radio stream.</p>

<hr>
<p>After teasing us with the announcement that Circle to Search is coming to its phones, Motorola is finally launching the feature on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">2024 Razr series</a> via a new update rolling out now.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> and the more affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> are currently receiving a new update, which seems to be a regular security and stability update at first glance. The update release notes only mention the September 2024 security patch and stability improvements, but nothing else. However, after I finished installing the update, Circle to Search was live on both phones.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is a simple way to search what's on your screen by pressing and holding the navigation bar and circling or selecting specific items. The feature works with images, text, and even audio, and it can translate what's on your screen in a pinch. Think of it as a more accessible Google Lens.</p><p>The feature has been exclusive to Pixel and Samsung phones since its launch earlier this year but has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-steps-up-to-challenge-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-with-this-ai-feature">recently started arriving on more phones</a>.</p><p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-is-finally-catching-up-to-samsung-with-these-ai-features">previously stated</a> that Circle to Search would be available on its devices, but the company neglected to state which devices would get the feature or when. We asked for clarification, but so far we have not received an answer. That said, it appears the 2023 Razr models have not received Circle to Search after receiving the most recent software update.</p><p>As for the models that did receive it, the feature is enabled by default, so you can start circling and searching after the phone reboots. To disable Circle to Search, navigate to <strong>Settings > Gestures > System navigation</strong>, where you'll find an option to toggle the feature off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="cX7CuSXUEPr52yrpFGsukQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-circle-to-search" alt="Circle to Search on the Motorola Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cX7CuSXUEPr52yrpFGsukQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update comes in at 1.05GB for the Razr Plus but just under 1GB for the Razr 2024.</p><p>Aside from Circle to Search, I also caught that the quick settings menu has a very pronounced fading effect when swiping out of it, something I didn't notice before. Otherwise, I haven't noticed anything else of note.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-of-many-2">The first of many?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GHUdW3V8ETfSKaSvqyKesj" name="Moto-AI-features-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-3.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHUdW3V8ETfSKaSvqyKesj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Curiously, this is the first update I've received since the phone launched in July, and that's not from a lack of checking. Motorola, while not being the best with timely updates, is usually good at keeping its bi-monthly cadence, which was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>.</p><p>It's possible the company was preparing to add the feature and thus delayed the update. Still, it's nice to see the feature being added so quickly after other OEMs like Honor are also getting Circle to Search.</p><p>In the meantime, Motorola is also preparing to add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">new Moto AI features</a> to its phones. At Lenovo Tech World 2024, the company revealed that these features were currently in beta and being tested with a small group of Razr 50/Ultra and Edge 50 Ultra users. However, the beta would be extended by the end of the year for more users.</p><p>These features will be able to summarize your notifications, remember conversations, recall images, and more. Motorola is also testing a Large Action Model (LAM) that essentially navigates apps on your behalf, doing things like ordering coffee and booking an Uber, although this is only a proof-of-concept at the moment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5" name="Moto-AI-LAM-Starbucks-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-5.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3749" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that Circle to Search is live on the Razr, hopefully Motorola's update cadence will improve. We also expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> to arrive on Motorola phones at some point, but Motorola has been pretty mum regarding its update plans. So far, at least one Motorola phone has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-edge-50-fusion-gets-android-15-beta">already received the Android 15 beta</a>, which is a good sign.</p>

Although it&apos;s an economy-level phone, the A35 is well-liked for its good-looking 6.5-inch display, decent battery life, and its inclusion of four years of Android updates. It&apos;s certainly nothing special if you&apos;re looking for peak performance, but those wanting a decent phone at a low price point might appreciate this deal.</p>

Performance certainly isn&apos;t going to blow anyone away with just 6GB of RAM and the Exynos 1380 processor, but this is a price point that&apos;s truly hard to beat for what&apos;s being offered.</p>

<ul><li>Leaks surface about the Pixel 9a's cameras and suggest its primary lens could drop to 48MP from the Pixel 8a's 64MP.</li><li>The ultrawide and selfie cameras are rumored to remain at 13MP.</li><li>A drop in camera strength was speculated, especially following Google's Director of Design's comments about why the Pixel 9's visor was so large.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors have surfaced regarding the camera strength of Google's next budget Pixel — and we can't say we're surprised.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> featured a camera worthy of champ status, but the latest rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-camera-specs">Android Headlines</a> claim its successor might see a sharp change. According to its post, the Google Pixel 9a is rumored to debut with a 48MP primary lens instead of the strong 64MP of its soon-to-be predecessor.</p><p>The next budget phone is suspected to arrive with a dual camera array, with the second lens being an ultrawide sensor like the Pixel 8a. The publication purports the Pixel 9a will continue that trend at 13MP. The post adds that the centered punch-hole selfie camera will likely stick with 13MP, too.</p><p>If the Pixel 9a sticks with the same sensors as last year, we might know what to expect. The Pixel 8a's ultrawide sensor features OIS (optical image stabilization), an <em>f</em>/2.2 aperture, and a 120-degree FOV. On the other hand, the selfie camera also features an <em>f</em>/2.2 aperture with a 95-degree FOV.</p><p>The publication then claims the Pixel 9a's rumored 48MP primary sensor is the same one Google gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. The company's foldable successor offers a 1/2-inch primary sensor with an <em>f</em>/1.7 aperture, OIS+EIS, and an 82-degree wide-angle view.</p><p>Moreover, rumors state the budget Pixel will feature the flagship Pixel 9 series' "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>" feature. The company debuted this during its keynote which, in layman's terms, is a function that pastes one snapshot onto another, giving the illusion that it was taken in one go. Add Me lets users get in on group photos as the photographer is typically the one that gets left out.</p>

<p>These camera rumors give us something to think about following the surprising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">alleged imagery</a> of the Pixel 9a. The renders showed the device missing an iconic Google symbol: its large camera visor. It seems the Pixel 9a will offer a camera housing flush to its back panel with its LED flash nestled directly to its right.</p><p>The potential camera strength of this device was in question, especially after Google defended the massive Pixel 9 series bump.</p><p>The company's Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">credited consumer interest</a> in photography and videography for the massive bump. People want to take better pictures/videos, but that comes at the cost of requiring larger sensors and lenses. This fact alone pushed what's possible for a camera array's thickness, which is why its recent Pixel 9 series housing is so pronounced.</p><p>With rumors consistently showing a Pixel 9a with a flush array, it makes sense why follow-up speculation drops its primary camera strength.</p><p>Other rumors state the budget Pixel could offer an 8/128GB (RAM/storage) configuration and a slightly larger battery than the Pixel 8a's 4,492mAh. Speculation about its display continues as rumors originally claimed 6.1 inches. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-dimension-display-size-rumors">a recent suggests</a> the display <em>could </em>increase to 6.2 or 6.3 inches.</p><p>The Pixel 9a may debut in Q2 2025.</p>

<ul><li>A report states Xiaomi's recent flagship phones utilize a unique co-processor that supports a snappier, more responsive Fast Pair.</li><li>Xiaomi's 14T Pro features CHRE (Context Hub Runtime Environment) support alongside other devices like the 14T and the 14 series.</li><li>The report states Xiaomi can do more with CHRE support, like potentially adding crash detection.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A discovery inside one of Xiaomi&apos;s recent flagship phones shows that a special chip is being put to work to make device pairing easy.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-fast-pair-on-chre-3492633/">Android Authority</a>) discovered "CHRE" support while examining the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro</a> code. The support was confirmed after an "android.hardware.context_hub" flag was found. According to Rahman, all of this refers to Google&apos;s Context Hub Runtime Environment, a specific Android API that "offloads" certain OS tasks, like Fast Pairing, to an ultra low-power co-processor.</p><p>More digging shows the 14T Pro contains a preloaded "nanoapp" called Google Nearby. The app enables Fast Pair discovery to run on CHRE.</p><p>In short, support for the context hub and the Google Nearby app makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fast-pair-bluetooth">Fast Pair</a> snappier and more responsive when called. Additionally, Rahman states Xiaomi could take things further with its CHRE support, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel">adding crash detection</a> and more.</p><p>CHRE support and the nanoapp were also discovered on the Xiaomi 14 series, 14T, and the POCO F6 series.</p><p>Rahman adds that the preloaded Nearby app is a "connectivity library" for Fast Pair <em>and </em>Quick Share. Supposedly Google stated CHRE was intended to "improve the responsiveness" of Quick Share, though it&apos;s unclear if support for such advancements has arrived.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VJLNPqbRSbFtvBvFoPnAsG" name="xiaomi-14t-pro-18.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14T Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJLNPqbRSbFtvBvFoPnAsG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s Fast Pair technology already made it easier for consumers to link Bluetooth-supported accessories with their phones. CHRE takes things further by making that "within range" necessity more responsive. Aside from devices like earbuds, Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-nest-matter-rollout-android-fast-pair">Fast Pair for Matter-supported</a> devices through Google Home.</p><p>A consumer&apos;s Home, Home Mini, or even Nest Hub Max would serve as the Matter hub. Fast Pair technology makes the onboarding process much faster when weaving new devices into your smart home ecosystem.</p><p>On Xiaomi&apos;s side, it seems likely that the company will continue CHRE support once its next phone, the 15 series, debuts. The company was in Hawaii yesterday (Oct 21) at Qualcomm&apos;s Summit 2024 to discuss what consumers can expect. Xiaomi&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-snapdragon-8-elite-keynote-announcement">SVP Adam Zeng announced</a> that the 15 series will be the first phone to feature Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC globally. The device will be paired with the company&apos;s HyperCore technology to reduce internal core temperatures and power consumption.</p><p>Moreover, the Xiaomi 15 series is slated to debut "at the end of October."</p>
