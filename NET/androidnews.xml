<ul><li>A report claims that Google is dropping the dongle design and pursuing a "TV Streamer" box to continue the Chromecast lineage.</li><li>The leaked photos show the box features a sloped design on a small pedestal with a redesigned remote that drops the Assistant icon and moves the volume rocker.</li><li>It was rumored earlier this year that Google was working on a Chromecast 4K successor, which pairs with a leaked remote photo from October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There&apos;s been a lot circulating about the "next generation of Chromecast," but a new report claims that Google isn&apos;t going the dongle route.</p><p>A couple of images shared with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/22/google-tv-streamer/">9to5Google</a> claim to be of the new "Google TV Streamer" box, which is said to replace the Chromecast dongle. The alleged lifestyle photos suggest the table-top designed box will have a slated form. This TV Streamer appears much wider than it is tall, as well. Additional functions, aside from streaming, are unknown.</p><p>The box will reportedly feature a slightly redesigned remote. It seems Google plans to keep the circular directional pad on top with the back option and a colored home button nestled beneath.</p><p>The "Voice" button drops Google Assistant&apos;s icon for a simple microphone symbol and is sat next to the volume rocker. The rocker in itself sees a shift from the side of the remote, which is what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast users</a> are currently accustomed to.</p><p>The rest of the remote will supposedly hold a YouTube and Netflix button, a "Star" shortcut icon, and a mute button.</p><p>Smaller rumored details state that the "TV Streamer" box will feature a power cable and an HDMI cable flowing from its rear ports. Moreover, the publication ponders whether or not Google will give this box the rumored Pixel Tablet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-media-handoff-discovered">ultra-wideband handoff feature</a>.</p>

<p>The rumors behind a "new" Chromecast have continued to evolve, but a report from April suggested a refreshed model could sport <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-successor-may-come-soon-new-remote">more RAM and/or storage</a>. Performance issues that are plaguing the almost four-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV 4K</a> could also be solved thanks to a new chip. The rumor stated a new remote could be paired with the streaming device, which we&apos;ve heard before.</p><p>Late last year, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-new-remote-leak">leaked rendering</a> of a tutorial photo for this revamped remote surfaced. The photo showed a button layout similar to what the photos offered to 9to5 look like. The circular D-pad on top with several buttons, the volume rocker, and the new "Star" icon would let users quickly hop into apps they&apos;ve enjoyed most.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when we could hear more about this "TV Streamer" box. However, we are coming up on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">August 13 hardware event</a> for Pixel devices. Let&apos;s not hold our breath over it.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that users can no longer purchase new episodes or seasons of shows directly on Google TV. </li><li>The company seems to be transitioning its content to Youtube, considering all new shows can now only be purchase via that app. </li><li>The update is set to roll out in the coming weeks, based on location and will not impact the ability to purchase movies on Google TV. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced on Tuesday (July 22) that it is changing how people purchase shows on Google TV.  </p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/thread/286737539/upcoming-changes-to-purchasing-tv-shows-from-google-tv?">blog post</a>, users can no longer buy episodes or seasons of TV shows on the platform from Google TV and Android TV devices. However, this update doesn&apos;t impact the ability to purchase movies on the platform. It looks like the company wants to completely transition to YouTube, keeping all streaming under one roof—as TV shows purchased until Tuesday will now be available through the YouTube app. </p><p>In 2022, YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/stream-full-seasons-tv-free-youtube/">added</a> thousands of TV shows to its platform, which allowed US viewers to watch full seasons of TV shows for free with ads, including "Hell’s Kitchen," "Andromeda," "Heartland," and more. At the same time, about 1,500 movies could also be streamed on the platform, making it easier for users to find the content they need in one place.</p><p>"You can continue to purchase <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9675559?hl=en&ref_topic=9257602&sjid=5906391914651371696-NC&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=1">TV shows from YouTube</a> depending on country availability," the post added. </p><p>Nevertheless, users can still access previously purchased shows on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, "including active rentals and entire TV seasons, regardless of where the purchase was made." New shows purchased on YouTube since yesterday can now only be streamed on the same platform.</p><p>Google has not clearly stated the reason behind this transition. However, it does say that this update will roll out in the coming weeks based on your country. This is said to impact Android and iOS users with the Google TV app on their devices.</p><p>The move definitely seems strange since the company seemingly wanted Google TV to be the hub for all things streaming back in December 2023, when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/play-movies-tv-shutters-in-january-2024-for-google-tv">announced</a> that the Google Play Movies & TV app would stop working and transition to the Google TV platform. Now that users can no longer purchase new shows on Google TV, it could cause them to move away from the platform altogether. It remains to be seen if Google will continue to have Google TV as a streaming platform or if it will also be gradually shelved.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Head of Mobile, TM Roh, recently discussed the company's focus on AI and the changes it could create.</li><li>Roh stated that the "AI phone" could push Samsung to create phones with new hardware, packed with upgraded sensors and maybe larger screens.</li><li>Samsung is looking into more affordable foldable phones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is going all in with its AI endeavors, as shown by a quick interview with one of its executives.</p><p>According to an interview between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.afr.com/technology/samsung-plans-different-shape-for-ai-phones-20240715-p5jtm5">Financial Review</a> (paywall) and Samsung Head of Mobile TM (Tae-moon) Roh, the company is doubling down on AI in phones (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_is_working_on_ai_phones_which_could_be_radically_different_from_current_phones-news-63807.php">GSMArena</a>). Shortly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">after Unpacked</a>, Roh stated that the company now sees the "AI phone" as its main business. Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile stated that, in the future, mobile AI will become increasingly "multi-modal."</p><p>To do this, a change-up in device hardware is likely. While Samsung views its current array of hardware as "sufficient" enough to handle AI, improved sensors and perhaps larger screens are in the cards.</p><p>"This new era of mobile AI calls for new hardware requirements, new performance, new form factors, opening up for new possibilities, so that mobile AI can be better leveraged with new requirements in hardware," Roh added.</p><p>Such hardware changes could be "radically different" when looking at the current lineup of phones, tablets, and other devices. Roh refused to state what sort of design changes Samsung was interested in pursuing. But we can&apos;t help but remember those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">unique foldable and rollable phone prototypes</a> Samsung had at CES 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="cnVn4Mi6GJUxWT7XdjFabJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-plus-all-colors-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cnVn4Mi6GJUxWT7XdjFabJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;re likely far off from those changes, but Roh stated that a present focus is on its foldable. "A more affordable price point" is an important focus, one Samsung recognizes as a "key demand" from the market. Roh informed the publication that Samsung is focusing its R&D on partnerships with other companies to pursue the "possibility" of cheaper foldable phones.</p><p>The company held its summer Unpacked event on July 10, which debuted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a>. While the hardware changes were minimal (and downright iterative), the Fold 6 is now slightly wider and more square. The Flip 6 looks extremely similar to the Flip 5 but boasts a stronger 50MP primary camera and a 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>Samsung also saw its foldable devices as the perfect place for Galaxy AI due <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-ai-experience-optimized-upcoming-foldable-teased">to their versatility</a>. There&apos;s likely more in store; however, the company briefly explained that its "Live Translate" will soon be available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-galaxy-ai-might-soon-translate-your-whatsapp-calls-on-the-fly">for third-party messaging apps</a> like WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 looks fairly similar to the Flip 5, though it boasts a much-needed 50MP primary camera. With a 6.7-inch internal display and a useful 3.4-inch cover screen, the Flip 6 can get things done and leave plenty of room for fun.</p></p>

<p>Another day dawns, and with it, another MagSafe product for me to test. If you&apos;re a content creator of any sort, you&apos;re going to be madly in love with the Moonside MagLight. At first, you might think it&apos;s just a magnetic ring light, but you&apos;d be underestimating a great product severely if you left it at that.</p><p>Before diving into its many capabilities, I need to give you a quick summary of the product. You can buy the Moonside MagLight as is, which is the Standard Pack, for about $87. Or you can do the smart thing and get the all-inclusive Creative Pack for $135. The Creative Pack takes the modest smart ring/cube light and transforms it into the mother of all accessories. That&apos;s the bundle I was sent, so that&apos;s the one I&apos;ll be talking about in this hands-on.</p>

<p>I bet you&apos;re already trying to evaluate the $135 asking price, but I&apos;m going to go ahead and say that whatever&apos;s inside the box goes well above and beyond that value.</p><p>Included for the price is a MagLight, a USB-C cable, a soft felt bag, two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe adapter rings</a> for non-MagSafe or non-Qi2 devices, a lanyard, a silicone frame for the MagLight, a MagFlip stand, and a MagPod with a Mini Tripod.</p>

<p>The Moonside MagLight is an RGB-laden 4,000mAh power bank that comes with a USB-C cable and two adhesive MagSafe rings for Android phones or non-MagSafe iPhones. Get this, Moonside&apos;s MagLight is both MagSafe and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2 compatible</a>, so you get up to 15W wireless charging on both iOS and Android devices.</p><p>The Moonside MagLight has 59 LEDs on the back and eight LEDs on the front, and each of those LED lights is individually customizable. That means you can handpick a specific color—out of 16 million colors—for each of those 67 LED bulbs within the light. How do you do that? Through the mobile app, of course!</p>

<p>The Moonside MagLight initially connects to your phone via Bluetooth, but what&apos;s super cool is that you can change the mode of connectivity to Wi-Fi through the app. And let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, the Moonside app is really something.</p><p>You get information like the battery life, connectivity mode, firmware version, whether you want to enable or disable wireless charging, and extensive settings for the LED lights. These include custom colors and brightness levels, completely turning the lights off, and downloading or creating new presets, scenes, and groups.</p><p>The attention to detail is incredible, but the app doesn&apos;t make it feel overwhelming. You feel like you can learn at your own pace.</p>

<p>I really appreciate the fact that you can turn the lights off completely, or choose to disable wireless charging. This gives you more control over the device and how you want to use it based on your needs in the moment.</p><p>The MagFlip is a magnetic stand made of extremely robust metal that feels reassuringly tough. It&apos;s surprisingly lightweight and unbelievably thin for something that feels this durable. The MagFlip has extremely strong magnets embedded in its arms, so you can put the MagLight on one side and your phone on the other, essentially creating a light source for your phone&apos;s camera while filming or taking pictures.</p>

<p>You can get even more creative with the MagLight and MagFlip combo, creating a mock camcorder with a customizable RGB light attached to it. I tried it out to capture images and videos in low-to-dark light settings, and the results were pleasing. Since the MagLight has adjustable brightness and produces a soft, diffused light, your content looks really nice. If you play around with the colors, you can create some really cool images or videos with this setup.</p><p>When you&apos;re in bed watching something on your phone, the MagFlip is the ideal phone stand. It&apos;s lightweight and sturdy at various angles, and thanks to the power of magnetism, it holds your phone in place.</p>

<p>For media professionals and influencers who need a little more height, the MagPod with Mini Tripod is a more suitable setup. This adjustable tripod is sturdy and built to be as reliable and stable as the MagFlip stand. You get a little arm attachment with MagSafe support, which is the MagPod, and it screws into the top of the Mini Tripod from Moonside.</p><p>The tripod and arm take up barely any space, but you don&apos;t have to sacrifice build quality for that small footprint. I was honestly very impressed with the ball joint in the Mini Tripod and just how sturdily it stays put at odd angles. You can also attach the MagPod to standard cameras and use the MagLight with your professional lenses that way.</p>

<p>Considering the comprehensiveness of the Moonside MagLight Creative Pack, it&apos;s hard to knock the product. You get excellent bang for your buck because if you were to buy these things individually, they&apos;d definitely cost you a lot more. Moonside gives you a one-year warranty for its products, so there&apos;s comfort in that as well.</p><p>All in all, this is a great deal and an unmissable set of tools for content creators, whether they&apos;re amateur influencers or more experienced media experts. Whoever you may be, if you like taking pictures and making videos, this is a superb starter pack.</p>

<hr>
<p>Emojis have become a part of our daily lives, so Google is bringing them to a new place and preparing us for new additions.</p><p>In light of World Emoji Day, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/world-emoji-day-2024/">glossed over a few fun facts</a> about emojis while also sliding in teasers for what&apos;s to come for YouTube. The video platform&apos;s Shorts are primed to receive a new "Emoji Kitchen Effect" feature for created videos. It seems users can experience a unique game overlayed on their video, picking which emojis they like the most.</p><p>Tilting your head left or right will select the emoji, which will combine to form a fantastic new creation (or an abomination). Google states this will roll out for users creating Shorts "in a few weeks."</p><p>An additional set of emojis is set to join Google&apos;s products under the Unicode 16.0 release. These are the seven expressions set to enter your keyboard: fingerprint, leafless tree, harp, face with bags under eyes, splat, shovel, root vegetable.</p><p>The release of these emojis will be quite spread with the post stating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> will pick it up "by March 2025." Other Google products should receive it "early" next year with the emojis appearing as a web font by September 2024.</p>

<p>Google then reiterates some present features in its ecosystem, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/june-2024-android-feature-drop">like emoji combos</a>. This new function arrived in June and lets users place two emojis into Messages and see a recommended "combination" of them. Take a disco ball and a set of headphones, and you&apos;ll get a glittering, iridescent disco headset. The combo can be texted as a sticker through Gboard.</p><p>There&apos;s also the ability to alter and set <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gboard-update-emoji-skin-tone-gender-presentation">a different skin tone</a> for certain emojis on Android, which rolled out last October.</p><p>Last year, Emojipedia showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/world-emoji-day-2023">the various trends and changes</a> that the world of emojis has experienced. Among them, the post stated that 26% of the posts on Twitter (now X) contained an emoji. That number was up 22% from what was observed in 2013. Last year, the most popular emoji award went to 😂 Face with Tears of Joy, with 🤣Rolling on the Floor Laughing in second and the ❤️ Red Heart in third.</p><p>Now, in 2024, Emojipedia held its usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://worldemojiawards.com/2024/most-popular-new-emoji">award ceremony</a> and gave the crown to 🙂‍↔️ head shaking horizontally.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve spent nearly two weeks with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, which launches tomorrow (July 24), testing how it compares to past Galaxy Watches. Thus far, it&apos;s a significantly better experience than the last-gen Galaxy Watches, but that also applies to the (much cheaper) Galaxy Watch 7. That makes buying the Galaxy Watch Ultra at its full $650 price tag a big ask.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra follows in the Apple Watch Ultra&apos;s footsteps, with upgrades like the third Quick Button, siren, and 3,000-nit display matching Apple&apos;s premium offerings. It&apos;s not a carbon copy, thankfully: Samsung kept its circular design identity intact <em>and</em> offers much better battery life. Plus, Samsung has used the "Ultra" label for nearly two decades — remember its "Ultra Edition" phones in the 2000s? — and has more right to the name.</p><p>Here&apos;s the issue: Samsung isn&apos;t competing with Apple, which gets away with high price tags, but rather itself and the expectations it&apos;s set with past generations. People accepted the $450 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and the $400 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>. The surcharges for better battery life, style, and controls felt reasonable. With the Galaxy Watch Ultra, some of the improvements are very niche, while the 3+-day battery life used to cost $200 less to get. Nor do you get the premium perks we&apos;ve come to expect with Ultra phones, like extra RAM or display size.</p><p>That&apos;s enough preamble and market analysis. Only you can decide if you can afford an expensive smartwatch, so I&apos;ll focus specifically on what makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra a great watch — and how it fares against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> today.</p>

<p>Samsung will release the Galaxy Watch Ultra on July 24, 2024, for $649 / £599 / €699 / CA$879 / A$1,299 / ₹59,999, with preorders ending on July 23. The $299 Galaxy Watch 7 is significantly more affordable.</p><p>Available in White, Silver, and Black, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has three band options: Marine, Trail, and Peakform. Preordering lets you add a second band for free. The nylon Trail band is the lightest for the best comfort but will absorb sweat. The elastomer Marine band will repel water for swimming and water sports but feels heaviest. And the rubber Peakform band is a sporty middle-ground option.</p><p>Samsung is offering a significant trade-in discount (varying by country) for the Galaxy Watch Ultra. In the U.S., for instance, you can get up to $350 off by trading in a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic or Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, plus the free second band. Any smartwatch in good condition will save $100, while specific Apple or Garmin watches save you more. This boosted trade-in value may end after the 23rd, however.</p>

<p>Samsung designed a watch that looks better in person than in photos. All you can see from afar is a chunky square; in person, the shiny, metallic contours and buttons, rounded edges, and raised bezel look attractive and distinct from any other smartwatch I&apos;ve worn.</p><p>Without a band, the Galaxy Watch Ultra weighs 60.5g / 2.13oz, comparable to the Watch 6 Classic 47mm (59g) but heavier than the Watch 5 Pro (46.5g). Unlike the Classic, most of that extra weight is for squircle aesthetics, not the function of a rotating bezel. Switching to this will be a real transition if you&apos;re used to the 1.5-inch Watch 6 (33.3g), though not compared to other "flagship" watches.</p><p>Still, this thing is chunky. Samsung claims it&apos;s 12.1mm thick, not including the massive health sensor lump; it&apos;s actually closer to 16mm. If you use this for sleep tracking — instead of buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> — you&apos;ll sleep on one specific side every night so it doesn&apos;t push into your wrist.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LaWFFCja96ECf6t6Bwb82M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-side-view.jpeg" alt="A close-up view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its Marine band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaWFFCja96ECf6t6Bwb82M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My colleague Nick argued that the watch "didn&apos;t feel like it was an overly bulky or massive watch" during his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra hands-on</a>, and I agree that it <em>looks</em> normal, though I&apos;m more conscious of its weight than I am wearing a traditional smartwatch while typing away at my desk. Out and about, I don&apos;t notice it.</p><p>I enlisted my smaller-wristed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch 9</a>-wearing fiancee for her opinion, having her wear the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> on either wrist. She said she&apos;d happily wear either but that she preferred the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s design and the fit of the Marine band over Apple&apos;s Trail band, which she said made it look and feel "top-heavy."</p><p>Though I find the Marine band too thick and would&apos;ve preferred the thinner nylon option, it <em>proportionally</em> matches the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s bulk, so the weight distributes more naturally, and it appears less oversized. I don&apos;t mind an imbalanced, blocky look for a softer, more breathable band, so I&apos;d choose Trail or Peakform.</p>

<p>What makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra "niche" is its rugged design, which is tailored for extreme conditions. All Samsung watches have the MIL-STD-810H label slapped on, meaning they should survive if dropped on the floor. However, Samsung specifically tested the durable Ultra for "high/ low temperatures, altitude, humidity, immersion, salt, fog, dust, vibration, and drops."</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra can survive elevations up to 29,527 feet, or slightly higher than Mount Everest. Of course, it&apos;s only rated for temperatures of -4°F to 131°F (-20ºC to 55ºC) before functions fail, and most mountain peaks get much colder than that. Ultra users will probably wear it in more casual workout conditions.</p><p>Samsung promises that the Galaxy Watch Ultra has 10ATM water resistance (double most watches&apos; max depth) and was tested in salty or chlorinated water, so you can safely swim anywhere so long as you gently rinse it off afterward. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="j3sbcMwSzXdxXWBGby3EjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-display.jpeg" alt="A close-up view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its default watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j3sbcMwSzXdxXWBGby3EjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Quick Button, nested between the usual two Home and Back buttons, opens up your Samsung Health exercises by default, though you can reconfigure it to trigger your flashlight, stopwatch, or water lock mode. Hold it down, and you&apos;ll trigger an 85db siren to help people find you in emergencies.</p><p>During a workout, you tap it to pause the activity instantly instead of having to swipe left and tap a button with sweaty fingers. It&apos;s extremely convenient, the main thing I&apos;d miss as a runner if I downgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p><p>My main complaint is that Samsung made the Quick Button crown-shaped but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">didn&apos;t add any crown functionality</a>. Without the Watch 6 Classic&apos;s physical bezel, you&apos;re fully reliant on swipes or rotating your finger along the display edge to scroll, and I much prefer a physical dial since that leaves my view of the display uninterrupted. Without a crown or bezel, the Ultra experience is missing something.</p>

<p>Samsung gave the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 7 44mm the same 1.5-inch, 480x480 display, except that the Ultra climbs up to 3,000 nits. That extra brightness looks fantastic in direct California sunlight, richly colorful and unimpeded by reflections. </p><p>It has Sapphire glass to protect against scratches and an elevated bezel that makes the display less likely to scrape against something than the fully-flat Watch 7. </p><p>You might wish Samsung had made the Ultra display even larger to justify the higher price, but it&apos;s already heavy enough. Maybe Samsung will transition the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2</a> to a squircle, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">as has been rumored</a>, to differentiate the Ultra from mainline Galaxy Watches. For now, Samsung made the right call by keeping things familiar for long-time Android watch fans.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 7</a> have nearly identical hardware. The four main Watch 6-to-7 upgrades — the Exynos W1000 CPU, doubled storage, dual-band GPS, and 3x the LEDs for better heart rate data — are found on both watches. I&apos;m glad Samsung didn&apos;t keep these new perks exclusive to try and upsell us, but that does mean the Ultra doesn&apos;t have that many exclusives besides extra battery life and built-in LTE cellular through your carrier.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t make these upgrades any less valuable. I&apos;ll talk in a later section about the excellent GPS and HR performance, and the doubled storage is vital for anyone who wants to stream music, podcasts, or audiobooks while using the Watch Ultra as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-to-want-lte-smartwatch-but-not-anymore">standalone smartwatch</a>.</p><p>As for the Exynos W1000 upgrade, I&apos;m having trouble quantifying its value. It&apos;s undoubtedly faster than my Watch 6 and (especially) Watch 5 Pro, loading apps and processing Google Assistant queries in a flash. But is it "2.7x quicker" than the last-gen watch, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/wearable-processor/exynos-w1000/">Samsung&apos;s marketing claims</a>? I can&apos;t see that stark difference in real-life use. I appreciate the boost, but I wonder if the Watch Ultra will still feel as fast in a few years with later Wear OS versions.</p>

<p>Samsung promises that the Galaxy Watch Ultra lasts 60 hours in standard conditions with always-on display active, 16 hours of workout time with dual-band GPS, or 100 hours in power-saving mode. </p><p>I haven&apos;t tried the latter yet, as I&apos;ve tried to put the Ultra through its paces whenever possible. As for standard longevity, it hasn&apos;t quite lived up to specs: the Ultra tends to only last about 40–45 hours with AOD, in my experience, with it stretching about 10–20 hours further without AOD. I&apos;ll have more definitive stats in my final review.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra did impress me by using just 15% battery across two hours of workout time, which would put it on pace for 13 hours of tracking. That&apos;s below estimate but still more than enough for most athletes, with enough capacity left for the rest of the day and night.</p><p>My Galaxy Watch 5 Pro consistently lasted longer out of the box with the same 590mAh capacity. I suspect two likely culprits: the Ultra&apos;s display and CPU. 3X the nits of brightness will burn more battery to keep things readable outdoors. And even though Samsung <em>says</em> its 3nm Exynos is more efficient than the Exynos W930 or W920, it&apos;s still clocked higher and doesn&apos;t have a co-processor to use Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS hybrid interface</a>.</p><p>Despite hoping the Galaxy Watch Ultra would last slightly longer, it still gives you an important step up over the Galaxy Watch 7 (and most other Android watches). And it has decently fast 10W charging, good enough to fill up from dead to 100% in two hours or less. But I do wonder if Samsung could&apos;ve squeezed a few more mAh into this ultra-thick watch.</p>

<p>Samsung tripled the number of LEDs in the Galaxy Watch Ultra compared to the Watch 6, which it promised would improve accuracy during intense workout activities from 88% to 94%. It also added dual-band GPS, which lets the watch pull your location data from multiple satellite positions to work around any obstructions like buildings or foliage.</p><p>Does it make a difference? Health and fitness data was my biggest knock against the Watch 6 when I reviewed it last year. This year, I performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">rapid-fire fitness test</a> and found that the Galaxy Watch Ultra closely matched up against a Garmin watch for GPS accuracy and a dedicated heart rate strap for HR data. It only struggled in one instance: when running an anaerobic track workout at a near-max heart rate.</p><p>Since then, I performed a longer test, running with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and Galaxy Watch Ultra on each wrist, both in dual-band mode. In the end, they both had a matching 160 bpm HR average and were only 0.01 miles apart in tracked distance after 9.5 miles. They also deviated by only 1 step per minute for tracked cadence, and their total tracked steps were only 309 apart after over 17,000 steps total.</p>

<p>Looking more closely at how they compare, the Galaxy Watch Ultra did start to struggle a bit in the later miles, randomly dipping in moments when I was stepping up my pace, then overcompensating and rising to higher heart rates. It averaged out, but "serious" athletes may want to rely on a dedicated strap for the best results.</p><p>In terms of GPS accuracy, Garmin did win the battle; the Galaxy Watch Ultra had mile-long stretches where it showed me off my running path, while Garmin stayed perfect. Practically, though, it didn&apos;t matter: the Ultra and Forerunner stayed parallel, without the weaving or signal loss the GPS-only Watch 6 had.</p><p>Overall, the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s fitness hardware is much stronger than in previous generations. The next step is to improve Samsung Health&apos;s rather basic fitness software, but I don&apos;t mind relying on third-party apps via the Play Store for now.</p>

<p>Most of your Samsung health data comes in a few forms: passive HR and stress data during the day, active ECG readings, and sleep tracking at night with data like blood oxygen (SpO2), skin temperature, respiration, and sleep stages.</p><p>Now, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking"><em>hate</em> sleeping with a watch</a>, which is a downside to this job. I got bored with it and slept wearing the Galaxy Watch Ultra and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review" target="_blank">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> as a comparison point since the latter is designed to track the same data seamlessly. Thankfully, both devices gave pretty darn similar results across all of the above categories. It&apos;s another step up from last year, where the Galaxy Watch 6 gave me some wonky sleep numbers. That said, I&apos;ll have more definitive data for the full review.</p><p>As a final minor point, I continue to be unimpressed by Samsung&apos;s BIA sensor. Last year, the Galaxy Watch 6 measured my body fat percentage, which was about 4% higher than my Withings scale (28 vs. 24%). This year, it has me at 24.7% instead of my current reading of 19.8%, with about 10 extra pounds of fat. I suspect the Ultra&apos;s little microcurrents can&apos;t reach down to my legs, so the algorithm just extrapolates based on my height and weight.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 44mm has most of the same perks as the Galaxy Watch Ultra, aside from its extra durability, battery life, and brightness. You can also buy it with LTE support if that matters. You miss out on the extra battery life, which is a fairly major drawback, and its design is much more basic. In exchange, it weighs (and costs) about half as much and measures 2.5mm thinner.</p><p>Looking outside of Samsung watches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> are two Android watches with consistent three or four-day battery life, and both cost significantly less than the Galaxy Watch Ultra. They both have their drawbacks, however. The TicWatch has yet to receive Wear OS 4, meaning it still has no Google Assistant; OnePlus&apos; watch has documented issues with heart rate accuracy. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Galaxy Watch Ultra if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Better battery life is your first priority</li><li>You're using an older smartwatch and want a new one that'll last years</li><li>You prefer the Galaxy Watch Ultra style over the Watch 7 (or Watch 6 Classic)</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Galaxy Watch Ultra if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're attached to the "Classic" look and bezel controls</li><li>You prefer a lighter smartwatch experience</li><li>You can't afford the Ultra for what it offers</li></ul>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is a great smartwatch that&apos;s enjoyable to use, adding the hardware changes necessary to make it feel powerful and reliable. Even if serious athletes would probably prefer something like a Garmin Fenix or another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brand, the Ultra falls in between casual and serious users in an intriguing way.</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch Ultra isn&apos;t all that different from the Watch 7. Its design is a bit polarizing without a physical bezel or crown, and its battery life isn&apos;t quite as long as I&apos;d hoped, steadily draining throughout the day even without "heavy" use.</p><p>If you can get your hands on one for a reasonable trade-in deal, I&apos;d certainly recommend upgrading to the Galaxy Watch Ultra if it looks and sounds appealing. Otherwise, at full price, it might be a tall ask. And given Samsung&apos;s path from Pro to Classic to Ultra in the last three years, you might decide to hold out for whatever new smartwatch experiment comes next, Ultra or otherwise!</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Revamped but risky</strong></em></p>
<p>Ignoring its high price and cheaper Watch 7 sibling, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is a great device that made nearly all of the hardware upgrades I'd have hoped for in a flagship smartwatch. I wish Samsung had given it a working crown and a little more battery to work with, but it's still a great option for anyone that can afford it.</p></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>So, you picked yourself up a shiny new Motorola Razr Plus 2024. Whether or not it&apos;s your first flip phone, setting up a new phone can be a daunting task, and even more so when the device has two screens. Fortunately, we&apos;re here to make the setup process a bit easier by showing you the first things you should definitely do once you move all your data over and are taken to the home screen for the first time.</p><p>Of course, we recommend you look through all the settings to get a full understanding of what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> can do, but these should put you in a pretty good place.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-adjust-the-display-colors"><span>Adjust the display colors</span></h2>
<p>One of the first things I like to do when setting up a phone is make sure the display is set to my liking. While many phones come with just two display settings for color reproduction, the new Motorola Razr Plus 2024 has three, giving you a little more control over your viewing experience.</p><p>Visit the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and select <strong>Display</strong>. Navigate to <strong>Colors</strong>, where you&apos;ll be met with three options: Natural, Radiant, and Vivid. These are laid out in order of how saturated the colors will appear, so Natural is a bit more muted while Vivid is heavily saturated and Radiant is somewhere in between.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="dbA3NiAXhQ4Mz4WoxpYF5g" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-display-colors.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 display color settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbA3NiAXhQ4Mz4WoxpYF5g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you select your preferred display mode, navigate to the bottom of the page, where you&apos;ll find a <strong>color wheel</strong>. This allows you to further adjust the temperature of the display, which can affect how the phone&apos;s color theme appears. To make it easy, there are also preselected options at the bottom, which includes Warm, Cool, and Custom, although you&apos;re always welcome to leave it at Default.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-control-panel-style"><span>Change control panel style</span></h2>
<p>With Motorola&apos;s new Hello UI, the company has switched up some of the various UI elements of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. However, the Control Center, where you&apos;ll find your quick settings toggles, will appear the same when you first turn it on. What Motorola doesn&apos;t tell you is that you can change how this looks to give it a more modern look.</p><p>To switch to the new mode, navigate to the <strong>Settings menu</strong>, then select <strong>Home & lock screen</strong>. Tap <strong>Control Center</strong> and select <strong>Modern Style</strong>. Now, when you swipe down from the top left corner, you&apos;ll find your notifications. Swiping down from the top right corner will take you to a fullscreen control center with permanent toggles for display brightness, volume, and connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="DSJsKmPPfMniR54d2kYqTf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-modern-control-center.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 modern control center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DSJsKmPPfMniR54d2kYqTf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tap the <strong>pencil icon</strong> in the top right corner and hit <strong>Edit quick settings</strong> to enable more toggles and place them wherever you want.</p><p>While it might seem bothersome to swipe down from two different sides of the display, you can always swipe over between notifications and the Control Center for quick and easy access. There&apos;s also a handy setting that lets you swipe down on the power button to open the Control Panel.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-sidebar"><span>Set up the sidebar</span></h2>
<p>Motorola&apos;s flavor of Android has a lot of handy features, but among my favorites is the Sidebar, which allows you quick access to your most used apps with just a swipe. I would highly recommend this for power users such as myself.</p><p>Navigate to the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and <strong>Gestures</strong>. Select <strong>Sidebar</strong> and tap the toggle to <strong>Use sidebar</strong>, then tap the <strong>settings cog</strong> at the bottom. From here, you can select up to 20 apps, tools, and contacts to add to your sidebar and arrange them however you please.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="rMEKfydWwAVkAEwqtm8WLg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-sidebar-1.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 sidebar settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMEKfydWwAVkAEwqtm8WLg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One you select your apps, tools, and contacts, hit the <strong>settings cog</strong> at the top right for even <strong>More Settings</strong>. Here, you can choose how apps open—whether in full screen or in freeform mode (floating window), set the power key to open the sidebar when you double tap, choose how notifications open, and turn on vibration feedback.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="R54nG3LnxNWYGfHkK33Pjh" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-sidebar-2.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 sidebar settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R54nG3LnxNWYGfHkK33Pjh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once your sidebar is set, you&apos;ll see a small bar on the side of your display. Swiping it will open your sidebar, which is available on almost any screen aside from full-screen games and videos.</p><p>You can always adjust where the bar sits on the display so that you can reach it more easily. Just open the sidebar then touch and hold the bar at the top, which will let you drag and place it anywhere on the screen. The two options at the bottom of the bar let you open your full app drawer in a window or adjust your sidebar.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-sleep-display-and-aod"><span>Enable Sleep display and AOD</span></h2>
<p>Always-on Display is one of the more handy features on any smartphone, and Motorola has put its own spin on it with the addition of Sleep Display. This lets you quickly interact with the display while the phone is "asleep," so you can view notifications and media player controls.</p><p>To enable both, head to the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and navigate to <strong>Home & lock screen </strong>(this setting is also in the <strong>External display</strong> menu). Toggle <strong>Sleep display</strong> or tap on the option to open the menu. Here, you can enable the always-on display, which will work on both the internal and external displays (it will turn off when the phone is in your pocket or in battery-saving mode).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="S4u3RxJsRcZRC2F74Fvu6h" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-sleep-display-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 sleep display settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4u3RxJsRcZRC2F74Fvu6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also turn on various <strong>Sleep display</strong> options, like <strong>Tap to show</strong> or <strong>Approach to show</strong>, the latter of which will turn on the interactive display when your hand approaches the cover screen.</p><p>The AOD also extends to the new Desk display feature, which we&apos;ll get to next.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-and-customize-desk-display"><span>Enable and customize Desk display</span></h2>
<p>One of the unique things about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> is the fact that they, well... flip. You can open the display at various angles for different functions, one of which is Motorola&apos;s new Desk Display. With this, you can set the phone down in Tend or Stand mode and it will display a screensaver of sorts while the phone is idle.</p><p>Navigate to the <strong>External display</strong> option in <strong>Settings</strong> and tap <strong>Desk display</strong>. You&apos;ll see two different options for <strong>Tent</strong> and <strong>Stand</strong>. Tap either one and toggle the option at the top to <strong>Show info in tent/stand mode</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="5u5eUCzTCUTqwA6xRfPYff" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-desk-display-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 desk display settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u5eUCzTCUTqwA6xRfPYff.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, you can select the options for what you want to show on the display, such as a clock or a picture (preset or add your own), notification icons, and music album covers. You can also enable the approach gesture to show the lock screen when your hand moves close to the external display.</p><p>It&apos;s a great way to utilize the form factor, and the images that Motorola includes are often quite cute.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-customize-your-cover-screen"><span>Customize your cover screen</span></h2>
<p>Speaking of the cover screen, this is something you&apos;ll definitely want to take some time to set up. While you can do this from the cover screen itself, it will probably be easier to set up from the main display.</p><p>Head to the <strong>External display menu</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> to view all of your options. You can set separate wallpapers and themes for your home screen and lock screen, adjust the font and display size, set the phone to answer and hang up when you flip the phone open and closed, manage the music player screen, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="8Yn4rJXrXue9akFA3twDui" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-external-display-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Yn4rJXrXue9akFA3twDui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Panels is one of the more important options, as this gives you all the fun functions that lets you get the most out of your cover screen. Navigate here and enable any of the 12 available panels and rearrange them at the top in your preferred order.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve done that, close your phone and swipe through your panels to make sure they&apos;re to your liking. You may need to sign into apps like Spotify or enable synching with your preferred calendar.</p><p>You can also pinch the screen to see all your panels and delete or add more. Swiping down from the top will reveal your quick settings, and tapping the icons in the bottom left corner will reveal notifications, battery info, and media.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-cover-screen-apps"><span>Set up cover screen apps</span></h2>
<p>When setting up the cover screen, make sure to <strong>enable the Apps panel</strong>. Close the phone and <strong>navigate to the Apps panel</strong>, then tap the <strong>pencil icon</strong> in the top right corner to <strong>Manage apps</strong>. Select the apps that you want access to from the cover screen and tap the check mark to confirm your selections. Then, on the Apps panel, <strong>press and hold</strong> on the apps to move them around and arrange the panel how you want.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.39%;"><img id="XgCFe37NqoTBJzKTZgHgZj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cover-screen-apps.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgCFe37NqoTBJzKTZgHgZj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2310" height="1372" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You should also add app shortcuts to the cover screen home page. When on the home page, <strong>press and hold</strong> the display to open the editor. Tap <strong>Home screen</strong> and tap on one of the empty boxes to add an app, then hit <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom when you&apos;re finished. You have a limit of four app shortcuts for the home screen.</p>

<p>We&apos;ll have a more in-depth look at how to set up and use apps on the cover screen, but this should get you started.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-moto-ai-to-create-a-new-wallpaper"><span>Use Moto AI to create a new wallpaper</span></h2>
<p>AI is the name of the game in 2024, and Motorola is getting a piece of the pie. While Google and Samsung both have a pretty similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI wallpaper</a> feature for Android 14, Motorola went in its own direction for the feature. The company has two different features you can select from to set up an AI wallpaper: Style Sync and Magic Canvas.</p><p>To access both, <strong>press and hold</strong> on the home screen and select <strong>Wallpapers</strong> in the menu. Tap <strong>Create with AI</strong> and select from either of the aforementioned options.</p>

<p>With <strong>Style Sync</strong>, you&apos;ll be prompted to <strong>take a photo or upload one</strong>. When you do, it will analyze the image and give you a few options of wallpapers based on the colors or patterns.</p><p>With <strong>Magic Canvas</strong>, you <strong>type in a prompt</strong>, and the phone will attempt to create an artistic image based on your text.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-toggle-auto-camcorder-mode"><span>Toggle Auto camcorder mode</span></h2>
<p>Motorola has a number of fun camera modes you should play around with, but one of them is Auto Camcorder Mode, which lets you take advantage of the folding form factor when holding the phone at an angle to shoot video.</p><p>To enable this mode, <strong>open the camera</strong> and tap the <strong>settings cog</strong> in the right corner, then toggle on <strong>Auto Camcorder Mode</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:118.61%;"><img id="C5U8sZm94u599vFWBX8hbg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-Auto-Camcorder-Mode-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 Auto Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5U8sZm94u599vFWBX8hbg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2310" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, when you fold the phone 90 degrees and flip it horizontally, the phone will count down from three and automatically start recording video, just like how you would hold an old-school video camera. It will also automatically show a live preview of the video on the cover screen, and you can even zoom in and out by moving your thumb across the bottom half of the display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.91%;"><img id="wRDbxYcYUA6Ja3bUcWiXtf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-Auto-Camcorder-Mode-UI.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 Auto Camcorder Mode UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wRDbxYcYUA6Ja3bUcWiXtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2640" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also quickly set the phone vertically while the countdown is still going to shoot a vertical video, which is perfect for social media. The only difference here is you won&apos;t have access to the zoom box at the bottom of the display, but that&apos;s likely because you&apos;ll probably be in front of the phone anyway when shooting vertically.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-smart-connect"><span>Set up Smart Connect</span></h2>
<p>Smart Connect is the equivalent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, allowing you to connect your phone to a PC or external display to turn it into a mobile desktop, simultaneously control your phone and other devices with a single mouse and keyboard, or seamlessly share content between your phone and your PC.</p><p>You can get started by opening the Smart Connect app and selecting a device type: PC, Tablet, or Display.</p><p>For PCs and tablets, you&apos;ll need to download the Smart Connect app onto the other device. For Displays, your phone will be able to connect to Miracast or Chromecast-enabled displays.</p>
