                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Projectors are on the rise globally, and Yaber wants to take advantage of that. The Chinese manufacturer is a relatively new entrant to this category, but it made decent inroads over the last two years on the back of budget-focused options. The brand has ambitious goals, and its general manager Marshall Mao wants to establish Yaber as an entertainment powerhouse.</p><p>To that effect, the brand will roll out new products and venture into new categories, but before all of that, it is looking to increase market share in areas where it has an established presence. That&apos;s the narrative behind the introduction of the T2 and T2 Plus, two budget portable projectors that have a unique retro styling, powerful sound, and bright 450-lumen projection.</p><p>I tested a lot of portable projectors in recent years, and Yaber&apos;s T2 Plus is an intriguing addition not only because it has a lengthy list of exciting features, but also because it is one of the most affordable options in this category. I used the T2 Plus for just over a month now, and here&apos;s why I think it is a great option if you&apos;re looking for a budget portable projector.</p>

<p>Yaber unveiled the T2 and T2 Plus on June 25, and the projectors are now available globally. The standard T2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yaber.com/products/yaber-projector-t2-t2-plus?variant=44166432751787">available for $299 on Amazon</a> (with $80 coupon), and you can also pick it up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yaber.com/products/yaber-projector-t2-t2-plus?variant=44166432751787">at Yaber&apos;s website</a>. The T2 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Yaber-Projector-Bluetooth-Portable-Compatible/dp/B0DD2SFDQG">retails for $349 on Amazon</a>, and the only difference between the standard model and the Plus variant is the Google TV dongle. If you already have a preferred streaming dongle, you can just get the regular T2.</p><p>Yaber says it&apos;s increasing its presence in the U.S., and as such, you can get the T2 Plus at Target, Walmart, and Best Buy — both online and retail storefronts. Yaber just introduced a Keith Haring limited edition variant of the T2 Plus with custom artwork on the sides and the handle, and that model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yaber.com/products/t2-special-edition">available for $399</a>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-yaber-t2-plus-design"><span>Yaber T2 Plus: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HNkGMypaAfxdiVtsaLCpbE" name="yaber-t2-plus-4.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HNkGMypaAfxdiVtsaLCpbE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most projectors broadly share the same design aesthetic, but that&apos;s not the case with the T2 Plus. Yaber did a great job with the design of the projector, and the cream color scheme combined with the retro styling gives makes it worthy of attention. If anything, it reminds me of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-horizon-ultra-4k-projector-review">XGIMI Horizon Ultra</a>, which costs five times as much.</p><p>Anyway, the styling doesn&apos;t suggest that the T2 Plus is a budget projector, and the build quality is pretty good too. The projector has a plastic chassis, and I don&apos;t have any issues with the overall fit and finish. There are vents at the front and back that ensures the projector doesn&apos;t overheat, and they&apos;re covered by a grille that blends in with the rest of the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uh9LGovYMJ3ru7HQLoNWXH" name="yaber-t2-plus-18.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uh9LGovYMJ3ru7HQLoNWXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a fabric cover over a third of the chassis, and this is where the audio drivers are located. The fabric contrasts well with the plastic chassis, and gives the T2 Plus a lot of character. There&apos;s a power button at the top, and the usual Yaber branding. The only issue I have with the design of the T2 Plus is that it is bigger and heavier than other portable projectors I used, limiting its usability outdoors.</p><p>The gold-accented lens housing looks great, and Yaber bundles a lens cap with the package that&apos;s meant to protect the lens from any dust. That said, the cap isn&apos;t tethered to the projector, and it&apos;s easy to lose it — I have no idea where I left it. The T2 Plus has sensors at the front that handle auto keystone and focus, and there&apos;s JBL branding to highlight Yaber&apos;s collaboration with the audio manufacturer.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a decent amount of connectivity considering the T2 Plus is aimed at the budget category. You get an IR slot, USB port, HDMI, 2.5mm audio out, and Ethernet. I don&apos;t see the Ethernet port getting much usage on this device, but I&apos;m glad it&apos;s available. On the bottom left is the barrel port to connect the power cable; the T2 Plus has a built-in battery, but if you want to run the projector at maximum brightness or charge the battery, you&apos;ll need to plug it in.</p><p>A unique trait of the T2 Plus is the carrying handle; it allows you to easily take the projector anywhere. What&apos;s interesting is that the handle doubles as a stand, so if you need to project against a wall, you can just extend the handle downwards and angle the T2 Plus. This is a neat design idea, and I made good use of it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s9VeqfMpqd9xnbFmeWfw6J" name="yaber-t2-plus-20.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9VeqfMpqd9xnbFmeWfw6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yaber has a basic UI of its own, but instead of building a smart interface, it just decided to bundle a Google TV dongle in the box, and that&apos;s a sensible choice. The dongle is connected to a 90-degree angled HDMI connecter so it doesn&apos;t jut out at the back, and it can easily be powered by the USB port at the back.</p><p>The built-in battery lasts up to two hours on a full charge, and that&apos;s decent enough if you want to use it outdoors. The T2 Plus has other niceties, including auto keystone adjustment and autofocus, and setting up the projector is about as easy as it gets. Just connect the dongle, power up the projector, and you&apos;ll get the usual configuration flow to set up Google TV and link it with your Google account.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iFwm8gJ8nqiWUWco9QFG5E" name="yaber-t2-plus-2.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iFwm8gJ8nqiWUWco9QFG5E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hassle-free usage makes a big difference, and the way Yaber handled the software is elegant. Other brands have had significant issues getting a Netflix license — this is still the biggest drawback of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro</a> — and by offering an existing dongle instead, Yaber worked around the issue. </p><p>The interface itself is identical to any Google TV device, and while it isn&apos;t as fluid as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Shield TV Pro</a>, it doesn&apos;t have much lag in regular use. There&apos;s Google Assistant and Cast, so you can easily cast content to the device with your phone. The bundled remote is also decent, and overall, Yaber did a great job with the essentials.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WmnXPaAZREhEHpvPhQH4dG" name="yaber-t2-plus-13.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmnXPaAZREhEHpvPhQH4dG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, you will need to connect a dongle to the back of the projector, and use a USB cable to power that. In a similar vein, while auto keystone does a decent job most of the time, it doesn&apos;t activate when the handle is down and the projector is inclined at an angle — you get a message that the sensor is obstructed. This is a pretty basic issue, and Yaber should have realized the positioning of the sensors would be a problem.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-yaber-t2-plus-picture-and-sound-quality"><span>Yaber T2 Plus: Picture and sound quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kKq7mQRSchzAUUsvsC5vpH" name="yaber-t2-plus-19.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKq7mQRSchzAUUsvsC5vpH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yaber says the T2 Plus goes up to 450 lumen, and the projector does a great job in this area. It is brighter than most other portable projectors I tested, but you will need to plug it in to get the maximum brightness — just like every other model in this segment. I usually have a power station on hand to connect projectors as it&apos;s just convenient, and I recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ecoflow-river-2-max-review">EcoFlow River 2 Max</a> — it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/EF-ECOFLOW-Portable-Charging-Generator/dp/B0CVZQ5RN1">costs $339 as of writing</a>.</p><p>Even with the built-in battery, the T2 Plus goes up to a decent brightness. Obviously, you can&apos;t use the projector if there&apos;s a lot of ambient light, but at night or with the blinds drawn, the T2 Plus comes into its own. The image quality is decent too, with good color vibrancy. It goes up to 1080p, and I didn&apos;t have any issues streaming YouTube or Netflix on the device.</p><p>The onboard sound is detailed and loud, and it doesn&apos;t distort at high volume. You can use the T2 Plus as a glorified Bluetooth speaker, and it&apos;s good enough at this particular task.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-yaber-t2-plus-the-competition"><span>Yaber T2 Plus: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S7QPZ3jUFEwFHfXdu97tMU" name="xgimi-mogo-2-pro-14.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S7QPZ3jUFEwFHfXdu97tMU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t a shortage of portable projectors, and XGIMI&apos;s MoGo 2 Pro continues to be a solid choice in this category. It gets sufficiently bright, is noticeably smaller, and has good colors. The biggest issue with the projector is that it doesn&apos;t have a native Netflix client. The MoGo 2 Pro doesn&apos;t have a built-in battery, but you can easily power it via a 65W power bank.</p><p>If you need a built-in battery and Netflix, the Nebula Capsule 3 is a good alternative. It doesn&apos;t get anywhere as bright as the T2 Plus, but it is smaller, and has better battery life.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a portable projector with Netflix</li><li>You need good sound quality</li><li>You want a built-in battery that lasts two hours</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a projector to use in daylight</li><li>You want easy portability</li><li>You want reliable auto keystone correction</li></ul>
<p>Yaber didn&apos;t leave anything on the table with the T2 Plus. The projector has a great design, and while it is on the larger side, the carrying handle makes it relatively easy to move it around. The onboard sound is decent, and the battery lasts up to two hours.</p><p>The biggest reason to buy the T2 Plus is the image quality. The projector gets brighter than most of its immediate rivals, and you get vibrant colors with a decent amount of customizability. It still isn&apos;t ideal for daytime use, but it does a better job in this regard than the likes of the MoGo 2 Pro.</p><p>Yaber&apos;s decision to use a standard Google TV dongle means you get Netflix and all other streaming services without any hassle, and ultimately, the T2 Plus is a good all-round choice if you need a portable projector.</p>

<ul><li>OPPO's executive director, Zhou Yibao posted on Weibo a concept image of a tri-fold device.</li><li>The device seems to sport sharper, square corners, slim bezels, and (potentially) an under-display selfie camera.</li><li>Curiously, Zhou Yibao removed the Weibo post, but from its contents, it seems that OPPO plans to progress with the tri-fold form factor.</li><li>Huawei, Xiaomi, and TECNO also reportedly have tri-fold foldables in production.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The race for tri-fold phones heats up as yet another smartphone OEM states they have one in the works, too.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://innogyan.in/2024/08/29/oppo-triple-foldable-phone-officially-exposed/">innoGyan</a>, the executive director of OPPO, Zhou Yibao, took to Weibo to state that the company has its own tri-fold device in development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_trifold_concept_showcased-news-64323.php">GSMArena</a>). From the concept image shared, the device features glossy hinge placements and a (potential) matte finish on its three rear panels.</p><p>It seems as though OPPO is leaning toward an in-display selfie camera. However, this is likely an early concept of what&apos;s in development, so it may not pan out that way. Other aspects suggest the phone could adopt a square form factor with pointed corners instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-and-n3-flip-global-launch">rounded ones like its other foldables</a>.</p><p>The display also seemingly features very minimalistic bezels along the edges. This could make for quite an immersive viewing experience — especially with a screen that large. Zhou Yibao&apos;s photo doesn&apos;t expand on what the cover display may look like, nor does it show off the rear camera array.</p><p>Interestingly, OPPO&apos;s executive director removed the post from Weibo shortly after posting. Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-triple-screen-foldable-3476510/">Android Authority</a> states that Zhou Yibao "suggests" that the posted concept is one OPPO is moving forward with.</p><p>The device will (hopefully) see a "formal reveal" after the OEM reportedly wraps up other projects.</p>

<p>Tri-folds have been thrust into the spotlight ever since Huawei&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-tri-fold-phone-former-ceo-photographed">former CEO was spotted with it</a>. The device is rumored to feature a 10-inch display when unfolded and a tipster claims the one the former CEO held is "similar" to previous prototypes. The live photo shows the device with a far left-side selfie camera, as well.</p><p>While Huawei&apos;s tri-fold is rumored for a September reveal, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">TECNO unveiled its version</a> officially two days ago on August 27. When folded, the company states users will experience a 6.4-inch display, but unfolding it reveals a 10-inch 3K OLED panel. Aside from small bezels, TECNO&apos;s device measures 11mm in thickness when folded. That is slightly thinner than Samsung&apos;s recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> as TECNO looks to take a leg up.</p><p>The announcement adds that the phone will adapt to how users are utilizing it so multitasking, wallpapers, and more feel more intuitive. TECNO&apos;s reveal was concept-only, meaning there&apos;s no information as to when we can expect it.</p><p>Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-tri-fold-phone-development-rumor">Xiaomi is working on a tri-fold phone</a>, reportedly, though this report was scant on details, aside from the fact that it might use the latest Snapdragon chip and the Leica camera system.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>battery life is a major selling point for you; you want a sleek phone and have liked past efforts from Motorola; you want intelligent camera features, such as the incredible Motorola Horizon Lock.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a telephoto camera that zooms in more than 2x; you want a newer device; you&apos;d rather go with something from the Samsung Galaxy lineup.</p><p>There&apos;s more than one reason why we considered the Edge Plus the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones#section-best-overall">best Motorola phone</a> last year, including its super-long battery life, high-powered performance, and the screen&apos;s 165Hz refresh rate, to name a few. Even if it is from last year, this phone holds up fairly well to the competition.</p><p>From our perspective, this was the best phone Motorola had released in a long time, and we always love seeing such an aesthetically pleasing device hit the market. Plus, Motorola&apos;s intelligent camera features like Horizon Lock, which intelligently stabilizes the horizon of captured video, make it fun to take pictures and video, even if there are a few odd limitations on 4K video recording.</p><p>If you&apos;re a fan of Motorola in general, then $300 off might be just the catalyst you need to try out the Edge Plus.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The internet never lies. Except when it told us that the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> with its long-ass name was at least 300% better than Google&apos;s Tensor 4 because benchmarks are eleventy times better. I think. Maybe.</p><p>This video from YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SucwT88p0oY">In Depth Tech Reviews</a> says otherwise. Using his 100% bonafide scientific methods, the Tensor G4-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> did better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (at this point, I like typing it) and is equal to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max&apos;s</a> A17 Pro when it comes to actually doing things.</p><p>My God, tech names suck.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SucwT88p0oY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>In case you can&apos;t be bothered to watch the video, all phones were cranked to max refresh rate, a Microsoft Teams meeting was joined, screen sharing mode was enabled, a 2160p YouTube video was played in picture-in-picture mode, Google Maps was set to navigate to the Dubai Mall, and all this is left running in the background whilst playing Asphalt 9. Yeah, it&apos;s totally normal things people do every day.</p><p>The verdict? Pixel 9 Pro XL handily beats the S24 Ultra because the S24 got too hot and crashed. And the Pixel couldn&apos;t do it without the sheer power of the mighty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">Google Tensor G4</a>. In fact, the Pixel was as good or better than the iPhone and we know that the iPhone&apos;s chip is like a supercharged V8 engine running on jet fuel and nitrous oxide. </p><p>While you knowingly nod because you knew the Pixel was unbeatable, please remember the poor Galaxy S24 during this difficult time.</p>
<p>OK, I can&apos;t do this. It&apos;s all bullshit.</p><p>The video is real, and it happened just the way I described it, but it means absolutely nothing. Just like running benchmarks and saying something different means absolutely nothing. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Let people enjoy doing it</a> if they like, but know that none of this makes any difference to anyone else.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re curious, this test shows that Google is doing a better job with thermal management than Apple and Samsung are doing. Certainly better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">previous Pixels</a>. That&apos;s not surprising because Google already said as much.</p><p>In the end, you&apos;ll find a phone for a particular thing if you want to buy it. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a> from companies like Red Magic that are better equipped to play games than anything from Samsung or Google. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-samsungs-s-pen-work-so-damn-well">productivity phones</a> like the Galaxy S24. And there are AI phones like the Pixel 9.</p>
<p>One thing they all have in common is that the companies making them have a vision about what they want the product to do. Do not fool yourself into thinking that Google isn&apos;t capable of building a product that beats Samsung at running Geekbench tests. It just doesn&apos;t care because it thinks you won&apos;t care. Google, at least for now, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">all about AI</a> and designs its products to work well with the way it does AI.</p><p>That&apos;s what the Pixel 9 is: the Google AI phone. Doing some crazy stuff might make for an entertaining video, but it doesn&apos;t tell you that one product is better than another. Buy what you like and whatever does the things you want it to do.</p><p>And for God&apos;s sake, can we stop arguing about it?</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the start of its rollout of Gemini's Q&A for Gmail on Android devices.</li><li>Q&A lets users ask Gemini to surface unread emails for the day or week, with the added ability to create a personal query.</li><li>Gemini's Q&A mirrors the side panel of tools Google rolled out for Gmail's web version in June, which expanded to include a few Workspace apps.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Gemini AI smarts have grown once again, as the company details an update for Gmail that could be a time saver.</p><p>As detailed in a Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/gmail-q-new-way-of-searching-your-inbox.html">blog post</a>, Gemini&apos;s Q&A feature on Android mirrors the AI&apos;s side panel view available on Gmail&apos;s web version. Users should notice Gemini&apos;s typical star icon beside the search bar as the update becomes available. Tapping it will produce a small menu with a few pre-made questions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can show you unread emails, unread emails from "this week," and the status of any orders you&apos;re expecting.</p><p>Users can skip these pre-made options and hit the text box beneath that for a question about a specific need. Google states that you can use your custom prompt to instruct Gemini to summarize emails about a topic or to find conversations between a specific person/contact.</p><p>Google adds that Gemini&apos;s Q&A can also be accessed from the "summarize this email" chip when viewing a conversation.</p><p>The AI model&apos;s latest productivity feature is rolling out for Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and Google One AI Premium add-on users.</p><p>The update has started rolling out today (August 29) and may take up to 15 days to complete for rapid/scheduled release domains. With Android users receiving this today, iOS folks will have to wait a little longer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.39%;"><img id="ZBLTR6sKMt5cuhqhP3oBYG" name="gmail-gemini-questions-answers-feature-rollout.jpg" alt="Google has started rolling out its Q&A Gemini feature for Gmail on Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZBLTR6sKMt5cuhqhP3oBYG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="276" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company then teased that Gemini&apos;s Q&A feature on Android will soon extend to encompass a user&apos;s Drive content. Google didn&apos;t provide a concrete timeframe aside from "in the future."</p><p>In June, Google detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-is-now-in-gmail-to-write-summaries-and-craft-replies-on-the-fly">a substantial update</a> for Gmail — though it was primarily for web-based users. The post highlighted the AI&apos;s inclusion in Gmail&apos;s sidebar on computers, packed with summarization, reply suggestions, and more. Additionally, Gemini&apos;s ability to understand a user&apos;s direct query about information in an email stood out.</p><p>Google highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-docs-sheets-slides-drive.html">the expanded capabilities</a> of Gemini&apos;s side panel, which ropes in Workspace apps like Docs, Slides, and Drive. For those apps, the AI can polish your writing, offer tips, and "creatively generate new content" from your Cloud-stored files. This is likely the direction Google is heading with its Q&A expansion coming up for Gmail on Android in the future.</p>

<ul><li>Verizon detailed its partnership with Skylo to bring commercial direct-to-device satellite-based texting services to its customers "this fall."</li><li>Skylo is the same satellite network Google uses for the Pixel 9, and Verizon states it will offer satellite roaming capabilities whenever its network is lost.</li><li>Verizon states that the service will arrive for "certain smartphones," but it does not specify which phones users can expect.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Verizon announced the beginning of a "first-of-its-kind" trial of satellite IoT, bringing such communication to commercial users "this fall."</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-skylo-launch-direct-device-messaging-customers">press release</a>, Verizon says it has partnered with Skylo to bring satellite-based text messaging to its customers (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/29/verizon-satellite-messaging/">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Srini Kalapala, Senior vice president of Technology and Product Development for Verizon stated, "We are encouraged by the progress being made in satellite-to-device communications for consumers and are equally excited to be driving technical innovation trials in the space of satellite IoT solutions."</p><p>Verizon highlights its partnership with Skylo due to its mobile satellite spectrum. The post adds that this technology should help "avoid" any network interference caused by terrestrial signals. More importantly, it brings that level of stability Verizon hopes to achieve for users connecting to satellites for text messaging in rural areas and places without a cell signal.</p><p>Starting later "this fall," Verizon states it will rollout its direct-to-device satellite-based text messaging capabilities for "certain phones." The company states this access will grant emergency messaging and location sharing with its cellular network is lost.</p><p>The company adds that it will be the first mobile carrier to launch commercial satellite-based communication. Unfortunately, Verizon doesn&apos;t specify which devices to expect satellite connectivity for. The publication speculates that this could arrive for a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-satellite-dies-before-it-could-live">don&apos;t have this capability built-in</a>.</p><p>While Verizon drums this up as a feature regular customers can expect, it does tease more for its enterprise (Business) users. Dubbed "satellite IoT roaming," the network provider hopes to expand its work with this communication to agriculture, transportation, maritime, and more.</p><p>The post adds that this solution can aid companies in monitoring animal movements, soil quality, and crops.</p><p>What&apos;s notable about this announcement is Verizon&apos;s use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-pixel-9s-satellite-sos-runs-on-tech-from-skylo-and-garmin">the same global satellite network</a> that Google leverages. Through Satellite SOS, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series uses Skylo to send, receive, and route a user&apos;s SOS functions from their phone to a satellite. All of your relevant emergency information is chucked over to Garmin and its 24/7 Response Team for assistance.</p><p>Google recently launched Satellite SOS on its Pixel 9 series, which included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/satellite-sos-launches-demo-pixel-9">a useful demo</a>. Users can simulate what it&apos;s like to connect to a satellite and have a pretend conversation about an emergency. The feature offers a set of questions at the start; however, the demo forgoes that in this fake scenario.</p>

Most people dismiss this idea, the companies that make the things assure us this isn&apos;t the case, but it looks true after all.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/heres-the-pitch-deck-for-active-listening-ad-targeting/">404 Media</a> discovered that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cmglocalsolutions.com/">Cox Media Group</a> was offering targeted advertising using the things you say out loud near gadgets with a microphone and an internet connection., which it called "Active Listening" ad targeting. Furthermore, documentation obtained by 404 lists Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Bing as CMG partners.</p>
<p>This is a nightmare scenario that a lot of us are worried about, even though we&apos;re constantly being told it can&apos;t happen. CMG never said how it could listen in when devices weren&apos;t supposed to be active, but unless the company was outright lying to customers, they have figured it out using particular devices or software trickery.</p><p>I contacted Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft with questions because we all deserve some answers. Meta and Microsoft have not yet responded, but when I hear back from them, I will include their responses in this post. In the meantime, a years-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/h/facebook-does-not-use-your-phones-microphone-for-ads-or-news-feed-stories/">blog post</a> from Meta specifically states how the company does not use your phone&apos;s mic to target ads.</p><p>A Google statement reads, "All advertisers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations as well as our Google Ads policies, and when we identify ads or advertisers that violate these policies, we will take appropriate action." Since this information became public, the company has removed CMG from its partner program.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.00%;"><img id="Ys5LkSexQAwkoKmyE2mP45" name="active-listening-header-art.png" alt="A CMG Active Listening sales presentation slide" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ys5LkSexQAwkoKmyE2mP45.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A slide from CMG's Active Listening </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 404 Media)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amazon told me in a statement that "Amazon Ads has never worked with CMG on this program and has no plans to do so." A plainly worded statement that I like to hear because there are millions of Alexa-enabled devices in homes across North America.</p>
<p>Technically, being able to listen in when you shouldn&apos;t is a tough nut to crack, especially with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-device" target="_blank">Echo devices</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phones</a>. All devices using Alexa and Google Assistant/Gemini have a microphone that&apos;s always active but programmed to initiate any sort of connection only when a specific keyword is identified. </p><p>You can see what Alexa has "heard" by looking in <strong>Settings > Privacy > Review Voice History</strong> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-alexa-app-redesign-rollout">Alexa app</a>. You can do the same for Google Assistant devices through the <strong>Settings > Privacy > Home Activity</strong> section of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/new-google-home-app-nest-cam-indoor">Google Home app</a>.</p>
<p>Android devices and Amazon Echo devices offer an additional safeguard: a visual indication when the microphone is active. On an Echo device, a blue LED turns on when Alexa is talking to the internet. Your Android devices have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-disable-microphone-and-camera-privacy-controls-android-12" target="_blank">status bar icon that shows a microphone</a> whenever an app or service — even Google&apos;s own services — has access to the mic. This was part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> and is available to every phone manufacturer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NxsDmp5nJoJM5zkhjqQkij" name="amazon-echo-spot-2024-music-bedside.jpg" alt="Amazon Echo Spot 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NxsDmp5nJoJM5zkhjqQkij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These are very valuable tools that you need to start paying attention to. I&apos;ve no doubt some very smart people work for CMG, but there are plenty of other companies with super-smart employees — employees who are smart enough to find ways to defeat the built-in protections to keep your private conversations private. Apparently, you can be intelligent without being ethical.</p>
<p>I don&apos;t know what this means for the smart home. I like being able to yell and have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">thermostat</a> adjusted or the kitchen light come on. I don&apos;t like knowing that someone may hear me talking to my wife about car tires and then show me ads for car tires. I dislike it so much I&apos;m willing to unplug my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Nest Hub</a> and put it in the closet.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231214235444/https://www.cmglocalsolutions.com/blog/active-listening-an-overview">blog post for Active Listening</a> was taken down shortly after the report, and in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cox-active-listening-claims-conversations-phones-target-ads-12-2023">statement obtained by Business Insider</a>, CMG stated that its businesses "do not listen to any conversations or have access to anything beyond a third-party aggregated, anonymized and fully encrypted data set that can be used for ad placement."</p><p>Still, I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve heard the last of this situation, and I know people at the companies who build our devices and work hard to prevent this can&apos;t be happy about it. In the meantime, know that the idea of someone always listening might just be real.</p>

<hr>
<p>All signs point to Samsung gearing up to release its next “FE” model, the Galaxy S24 FE. It’s a slightly more affordable version of the Galaxy S24 with a pared-down feature set to match. Following months of leaks and rumors, it’s now time to get excited. The smartphone has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-fe-fcc-certification-listing-launch-rumors">appeared in regulatory filings with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a>. In the phone world, that means a launch could be imminent.</p><p>Typically, Galaxy FE models don’t have breakthrough designs or creative form factors. They’re often just a derivative of the current Galaxy flagship design or the last “Fan Edition” smartphone. However, a leak from April 2024 indicates that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-images-leak">Galaxy S24 FE could be coming in a bunch of new and fresh colors</a> from Samsung this year. Smaller bezels could be coming too, and multiple leaks have pointed to an October release window.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QQxJUB8kzYcB6dkJT9yBBi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-display-lockscreen-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QQxJUB8kzYcB6dkJT9yBBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The regular Samsung Galaxy S24 display. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it’s hard to see a way that the Galaxy S24 FE becomes a surefire recommendation, even as the regular Galaxy S24 season nears a year old. We don’t know the exact specifications yet, but Samsung will have to shave off some Galaxy S24 features to offer the Galaxy S24 FE at a lower price point. Last year, the Galaxy S23 retailed for $800 and the Galaxy S23 FE later debuted at $600, offering a mid-tier variant $200 cheaper than Samsung’s base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a>. </p><p>We liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a> when it arrived, but it launched when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> was frequently discounted and the S24 was just a couple months out. No matter how good it was for its mid-range price, that made it an odd phone to recommend.</p><p>This year’s Galaxy S24 retailed for $800 too, and it’s available for that price from most retailers at the time of writing. However, if you look carefully, you’ll notice that the base-model Galaxy S24 goes on sale <em>a lot</em>. Just last weekend, the phone was $150 off at major retailers, bringing the price down to $650. These massive discounts happen often, and deals holidays like Prime Day and Black Friday net you even bigger savings.</p><p>While it’s great that you can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> for between $600 and $700 if you buy it at the right time, this creates a problem. There’s little reason to buy an “FE” model for $200 less than Samsung’s flagship if the flagship is also heavily discounted. Let’s say the Galaxy S24 FE comes in at $600, keeping in line with last year’s pricing. Would you want to buy that phone, or hold out for a Galaxy S24 deal? We can’t say for absolute certainty which would be the better deal — we haven’t tried the Galaxy S24 FE, of course, and it hasn’t been announced — but my money’s on the discounted Galaxy S24.</p><p>If you’ve been following the smartphone market for a while, this isn’t a new problem, and it isn’t unique to Samsung. A similar discourse follows the Google Pixel lineup. Originally a tiny sector with only a few devices, the Pixel lineup now features seven phones that are still being sold from the Google Store, including the Pixel 9 series, Pixel 8a, and Pixel 7a. That might be bumped up to eight devices soon, as Google confirmed it’s brining back the original Pixel Fold when the Pixel 9 Pro Fold originally launches.</p><p>Google’s now-bloated lineup feels like overkill where the Pixel A-series is concerned. By the time the Google Pixel 9a comes out, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> will probably cheap enough to make the difference negligible. The same now goes for the Galaxy FE series.  If I had to guess, the Galaxy S24 and the Galaxy S24 FE will be very similar in price when the new midranger launches.</p>
<h2 id="you-should-hold-out-for-black-friday-deals-instead-2">You should hold out for Black Friday deals instead</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9h4qLmMGqc4uXuxtpH2esm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-purple-frame-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9h4qLmMGqc4uXuxtpH2esm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It all begs the question of whether we need these pared-down midrangers in the first place. The Galaxy FE and Pixel A series both undercut their flagship counterparts only slightly, and I’d rather see Samsung and Google discount their base-model flagships than develop and produce a whole new phone. The tech industry wants to tout how environmentally conscious it is, but the best way to be sustainable is to simply make fewer things. Even if something is 100% recycled and carbon-neutral, it’s still more harmful than just making use of what we already have — the Galaxy S24.</p><p>That’s wishful thinking, I know. There’s more to it than that, though. After testing many of the best phones and scouring the internet for deals for years, I’m convinced that buying a Galaxy FE or Pixel A phone at full price is usually a bad deal. If you can hold out for a discount on a flagship or have just a bit extra money to spend, you’d be better off buying a Galaxy S24 or Pixel 8.</p><p>I bet this will be even more true with the Galaxy S24 FE. It’s slated for release in October, if the rumors are correct, which is about a month before Black Friday and Cyber Monday. I can’t predict the future, but I would expect the Galaxy S24 to see a significant discount around the holiday shopping season, making it a more attractive buy than the Galaxy S24 FE for budget buyers. If that’s the case, why even bother with the Galaxy S24 FE?</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's latest security patch for Galaxy S21 models has hit the U.S. market</li><li>It includes critical and high vulnerability fixes from both Google and Samsung.</li><li>The update is available for all carrier networks alongside the factory-unlocked versions in the country.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s latest software update for the Galaxy S21 series recently hit the U.S. region. It includes the August security patch and some fixes to vulnerabilities.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-august-2024-security-update-released-usa/">SamMobile</a>, the latest security patch bearing the <strong>G99xU1UEUCGXGB</strong> version is being rolled out to the U.S. region&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review">Galaxy S21</a>, S21 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review">S21 Ultra</a> models. It also fixes around 50 vulnerabilities reportedly found in the previous firmware. Along with the factory-unlocked models, the update is also believed to be available for all local carrier networks.</p>
<p>Samsung enthusiasts are anticipating the next major One UI 6.1.1, which is rumored to be coming soon. In the meantime, this minor yet essential update is a welcome sight. It rolled out to the Galaxy S21 series in other Asian and European regions about two weeks ago. </p><p>Users of the aforementioned devices in the U.S. can head over to <strong>Settings > Software update ></strong> and hit <strong>Download </strong>and<strong> Install.</strong></p><p>The latest update follows the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-august-2024-security-patch">critical August update</a>, rolled out to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which fixed a major flaw dubbed <strong>CVE-2024-32896</strong>. It reportedly impacted most of Samsung&apos;s smartphones and tablets. It was later rolled out to other Galaxy S24 devices as well. You can check Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">full August security update list</a> at that link.</p>

<p>In other news, another Galaxy S21 model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe">Galaxy S21 FE</a>, was found testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> with One UI 7.0 running on top of it, per a leaked benchmark test (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-android-15-one-ui-7-benchmark/">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>The latest findings contrast with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">recent report</a> highlighting the delay of the One UI 7 beta rollout, which has been put on hold. Previously, the beta rollout was scheduled to launch on July 29. The current development of One UI 6.1.1 and stability issues with the upcoming Android 15-based operating system are believed to be the primary reasons for the delay.</p><p>Regardless, the benchmark test suggests that the much-anticipated One UI 7.0 may be sooner, although One UI 6.1.1 would be the first one to roll out.</p>

<ul><li>A new rumor claims Samsung is working on a "thinner and lighter" Galaxy S25 Ultra that will beat out its previous Ultra model devices.</li><li>Without getting specific, the tipster claims the S25 Ultra will beat Google's Pixel 9 Pro XL and Apple's next iPhone 16 Pro Max in those respective areas.</li><li>Following the rumors, there were concerns about the device's battery and whether or not Samsung would change its materials to enable a large capacity in a smaller space.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors continue to swirl about the Galaxy S25 Ultra as the latest speculates about some key changes.</p><p>A post on X from known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1828698013243769173">Ice Universe</a> claims that Samsung is working to build the "thinnest and lightest" Ultra model phone with the S25 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/08/galaxy-s25-ultra-thinner-lighter-than-iphone-16-pro-max.html">Android Headlines</a>). According to the post, the device will feature specifications in those areas that may rival Google&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro XL and Apple&apos;s upcoming iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p><p>The post didn&apos;t go into specifics; however, the publication notes that Google&apos;s recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> weighs 221 grams. If Samsung is truly going for "lighter," then that&apos;s where things begin and not the 232 grams of the S24 Ultra. Moreover, the Pro XL measures 8.5mm in thickness while the S24 Ultra is 8.6mm.</p><p>This fact (and rumor) has sparked some curiosity from consumers with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Urban_el_soul_2/status/1828698268454236305">one comment</a> wondering if there will be a battery swap. Samsung&apos;s current flagship Ultra offers a 5,000mAh battery, leaving the user to wonder if the next will utilize a silicon battery to keep it thin, yet powerful.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ice Universe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5071601329242163">took to Weibo</a> to post a couple of supposed renderings of the S25 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/28/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-design-note/">9to5Google</a>). The imagery seemingly doubles down on what we&apos;ve seen previously as the device could sport slightly slimmer bezels and rounded corners instead of ones that dig into your palm.</p><p>Unfortunately, the brief side view of the device doesn&apos;t offer much in terms of the tipster&apos;s recently proposed "thinness."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The S25 Ultra will be the thinnest and lightest of all Ultra flagship phones to be released soon, including iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pixel 9 Pro XL.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1828698013243769173">August 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung was (unsurprisingly) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-wont-probably-blow-your-mind-with-its-battery-life">rumored to continue</a> to feature a 5,000mAh battery inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra. With reports claiming that the company plans to go thinner and concerns about its battery, it makes us think back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery</a> from OnePlus. The Chinese OEM highlighted the new technology in June as it worked to pop a 6,100mAh battery into the Ace 3 Pro.</p><p>OnePlus used silicon-carbon material to keep the battery "smaller than the conventional 5,000mAh batteries found in most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>." Of course, deciding to change the R&D behind the battery of the S25 Ultra will depend on <em>how </em>thin Samsung plans to go — if this is happening.</p><p>Another recent Galaxy S25 Ultra rumor suggested that it will feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-narrow-body-frame-rumors">narrower aspect ratio</a>. This would join the alleged shift to rounded corners instead of squared ones, as Samsung may look to improve the one-handed experience of its top model.</p><p>It was also suggested that a few name changes could befall the S25 Ultra and S25 Plus, but that&apos;s still in the air.</p>
