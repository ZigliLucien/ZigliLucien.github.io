<p>In our opinion, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">Jabra Elite 10s</a> are the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> on the market today, and you can save $50 on them while this deal lasts. Buyers love the Elite 10s for their solid audio quality and features, like spatial audio and ANC. Plus, they're comfortable to wear, they offer up to 30 hours of battery life with the charging case, and they're rated IP57 for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are only a few left in gloss black and titanium black at Best Buy, though you can also get this deal on the cocoa and cream colors if you get there too late—or check them out from some other retailers.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Jabra-Elite-10-True-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Adv-Active-Noise-Cancelling-Cocoa/5087522827">Walmart - $199.99</a> |<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-True-Wireless-Earbuds/dp/B0CB91JNZT">Amazon - $199.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jabra-elite-10-dolby-atmos-true-wireless-in-ear-heaphones-gloss-black/6553258.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="206afa41-aac4-4997-8d1a-1d3638d137e9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Jabra Elite 10 wireless earbuds: $249.99" data-dimension48="Jabra Elite 10 wireless earbuds: $249.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want earbuds with premium audio and listening features, such as ANC, Dolby Atmos, and EQ presets; wireless charging is a major priority for you in headphones; you&apos;re looking for an especially comfortable pair of earbuds.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> ; you prefer bigger name-brand options like earbuds from Sony or Bose; you want hi-res codec support. </p><p>The Jabra Elite 10 earbuds feature powerful and clear audio from 10mm drivers, along with EQ presets, a useful, adaptive ANC, and beautiful spatial audio. The Jabra app also makes it easy to configure audio however you want, while built-in microphones let you talk on the phone or use voice assistants like Siri. On their own, these earbuds offer up to 8 hours of battery life, or up to a total of 30 hours with the use of the charging case.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the head tracking feature offers a pretty cool surround sound-like audio feature, though it can make the battery life drop pretty substantially. While they aren&apos;t as durable as the classic Jabra Elite 8 Active, they will still hold up pretty well compared to most earbuds.</p>

Some of its arguments have genuine merit, but Google, which made $300 billion last year, looks more like a shameless bully than anything else.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-starts-removing-links-to-california-news-outlets-ahead-of-proposed-bill">California&apos;s Journalism Preservation Act</a>—which would charge Google a percentage of its advertising revenue from links to California news publications—hasn&apos;t passed yet. That hasn&apos;t stopped Google from preemptively "removing links to California news websites" and "pausing further investments in the California news ecosystem," according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/news/california-journalism-preservation-act-puts-news-ecosystem-at-risk/" target="_blank">sorrowful post</a> from Google News&apos; VP Jaffer Zaidi. </p><p>If this sounds familiar, it&apos;s because Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-response-canada-bill-c-18">blocked Canadian news sites</a> in response to a similar bill before eventually relenting with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-canada-bill-c-18-agreement">CA$100 million payout</a> to news organizations. It also had a similar showdown with Australia a few years back.</p><p>Google wants to nip this in the bud, showing the California State Assembly that it will happily kill California news sites to preempt this policy while pinning the blame on politicians. Because, like California&apos;s CCPA anti-cookie law, this "link tax" law would likely have nationwide implications for the internet if it succeeds (or fails) here.</p>
<h2 id="why-google-is-attacking-its-own-state-2">Why Google is attacking its own state</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Ju59Sqekeua2jvxr2GDQoT" name="Android-statue.jpg" alt="Android statues" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ju59Sqekeua2jvxr2GDQoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android statues at Google's Mountain View campus </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s main stated objection to the California Journalism Preservation Act is that it already helps "publishers of all sizes grow their audiences at no cost to them." It doesn&apos;t mention the reverse, that Google&apos;s entire business strategy involves making billions off of ad revenue for content <em>it</em> didn&apos;t pay for.</p><p>Local news publications, losing their print revenue, became fully dependent upon Google Search. Digital ad revenue wasn&apos;t enough to remain financially <em>in</em>dependent: many joined the California Newspapers Partnership, while others got bought up by billionaires, private equity groups, or nationwide conglomerates like Hearst. And all of them slashed their newsrooms down.</p><p>Zaidi says these same organizations would "use funds from CJPA to continue to buy up local California newspapers, strip them of journalists, and create more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/the-rise-of-the-ghost-newspaper/" target="_blank">ghost papers</a> that operate with a skeleton crew to produce only low-cost, and often low-quality, content." If that weren&apos;t already happening today, the prospect might be scarier. </p><p>Content farms already exist, all fighting for top placement in Google&apos;s SEO algorithm. It&apos;s typically been local journalism that loses to bigger sites that take and repackage original reporting with clickbait headlines, then rank higher on Google Search by default.</p><p>The CJPA, which requires a 70% investment of taxed funds in journalists, would presumably prevent these media groups from just taking Google&apos;s money from ghost papers for themselves. Even a pittance of Google&apos;s annual profits might keep these sites afloat, which would in turn help Google with its AI endeavors.</p><p>Instead, its no-California-websites strategy will bankrupt the few independent sources of news it has left since well-known brands like the LA Times are already struggling to survive.</p>
<h2 id="google-isn-apos-t-thinking-long-term-2">Google isn&apos;t thinking long-term</h2>
<p>Right now, Google Search typically gives its top results slot to either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-sponsored-ads-only-hurt-its-credibility">Sponsored ads</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> summary that repackages data from news sites instead of the featured snippets that highlight the site with the best answer. It technically cites sources, but most are hidden in auto-closed dropdown menus. </p><p>Once AI stops hallucinating and can provide quick answers to questions, it&apos;ll mean people don&apos;t have to hunt through multiple links to find the answer—which benefits Google in the short term. The problem is that the reduced traffic will bankrupt the sites that provide that information to Google, which will lobotomize its AI in the long run. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new Google Gemini AI app </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like any public tech company, Google&apos;s primary drive is maximizing shareholder profits. The "Killed by Google" trope became so prevalent because Google is unsentimental about casting aside projects (and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-lays-off-hundreds-in-ar-assistant-while-losing-fitbit-executives">own talent</a>), especially in recent years.</p><p>In executives&apos; eyes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-pay-publishers-1-billion-over-three-years-news-articles">Google News Showcase</a> and its $1 billion investment are more than generous, and they&apos;re the ones highlighting reputable news sources as more and more people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gen-z-search-using-tiktok-and-instagram-instead-of-google">turn to video-based news sources like TikTok and Instagram</a>. </p><p>In this context, only a law like the CJPA will motivate Google to compensate the websites that it <em>needs</em> to survive. Without it, Google will starve news organizations of what little revenue they have left, water down its Search results with unreliable AI data and sloppily researched newsers, and push younger generations to rely on video apps for news even more than they do now.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-case-against-the-cjpa-2">The *real* case against the CJPA</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5" name="New-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="X logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the virtue signaling about preserving journalism, the crux of Google&apos;s argument is buried near the end of Zaidi&apos;s post: That the CJPA in its current form "would create a level of business uncertainty that no company could accept." </p><p>Google and other aggregate sites don&apos;t want to add a new, variable operating cost to their earnings spreadsheets that might discourage shareholders from allowing them to continue linking to news sites. That&apos;s it.</p><p>A nationwide version of this bill, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA), prompted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-opposes-journalism-bill-that-would-harm-press-freedoms-and-free-speech-online" target="_blank">ACLU</a> to oppose it, saying that "by making platforms pay to access and display these facts, this legislation would make it harder for consumers to find news on social media, or in their search results. Platforms would likely choose not to link to news at all, or charge customers to view it."</p><p>I can certainly picture someone like Elon Musk making clickable links a Twitter Blue feature, hurting its status as a political town square for breaking news. While bigger sites like Google clearly have the money to pay news sites more, other sources might not have the same profitability to afford it. This could suppress news information in ways we can&apos;t predict. </p><p>In other words, I&apos;m not blindly saying that the CJPA is perfect or that companies aren&apos;t justified in trying to stop it and preserve the status quo that "works" now.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="M6HFoKyPCZeGYFyfkYRK5n" name="Google-logo-dark-illuminated-wide.jpg" alt="The Google Logo in Black and White under a sepia shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6HFoKyPCZeGYFyfkYRK5n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll freely admit to my own bias as a California-based journalist. This policy wouldn&apos;t affect me personally since Android Central&apos;s parent company isn&apos;t based here. However, it would affect the Bay Area newspapers my parents still diligently read every day or the single sources of local coverage that many small California cities have.</p><p>It&apos;s a near certainty that these people will begin losing their jobs, quickly. Before coming to Android Central, our new news editor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/nandika-ravi">Nandika Ravi</a>, was displaced from her previous job after her Ontario-based employer lost 33% of its traffic thanks to Instagram, Facebook, and Google banning Canadian links, subsequently laying off one-third of its staff shortly after the policy change. </p><p>She told me that the site, which used to cover seven cities in that province, had to cut local coverage for the smaller cities to stay afloat, and that the layoffs also hit larger news organizations, meaning those laid off wouldn&apos;t find any openings elsewhere. Finding remote work in another country was her only option. </p><p>At the time, Android Central&apos;s Jerry Hildenbrand wrote that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-and-canada-prove-that-doing-the-right-thing-sometimes-sucks-for-everyone">both Canada and Google were in the right</a>: Canada had the duty to prop up struggling news publications for the sake of a healthy, informed democracy, and Google had every right to refuse to pay for content when it can share free content from elsewhere.</p><p>That said, Google has become the successful monopoly it is today, in part, thanks to a very friendly California legislature that essentially let it form its own Mountain View fiefdom. To lash out at its home state and put Californian jobs and journalism in jeopardy to try and force friendly government policy is a bad look, if nothing else.</p><p>Whatever happens, Google&apos;s willingness to worsen its search results to keep hoarding its wealth is precisely why fewer people are willing to trust Search blindly these days. No one is "feeling lucky" anymore.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a couple of updates for Maps and Search that are designed to aid users in finding more sustainable ways to travel.</li><li>For Maps, users will find low-carbon travel alternatives alongside driving routes while Search picks up long-distance information for trains and buses.</li><li>Google is also bringing more awareness to emissions from flights for developers creating apps and websites.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ahead of Earth Day next week, Google is bringing a few updates to Maps and Search that may help users make better-informed choices around more "sustainable" methods of travel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> is set to pick up a feature that displays low-carbon alternatives when traveling. The company states users in Maps will soon find routes for walking and public transit alongside driving routes.</p><p>However, Google will only do this if "travel times are comparable and practical" so you won&apos;t be too delayed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:155.84%;"><img id="VqixVGEruz6yzHzrx3oCiF" name="google-maps-sustainable-travel-options-route.jpg" alt="Google is starting to show low-carbon alternatives for those traveling using Google Maps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqixVGEruz6yzHzrx3oCiF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="385" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These low-carbon alternatives will appear in "over fifteen cities" worldwide. This includes Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, Montreal, Paris, Rome, and Sydney. Google will begin rolling this feature out today (April 17) for Maps.</p><p>The second feature involves Google Search, as users can now inquire about long-distance trains and buses. For instance, the company says users can search for "Boston to Philadelphia train" and quickly discover schedules and ticket prices in a neat table below the search bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:368px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:163.04%;"><img id="eY38LLLn8zpqgAHxTqmeHT" name="google-search-long-distance-train-bus-routes.jpg" alt="Google Search will now offer information on schedules and tickets for long-distance trains and buses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eY38LLLn8zpqgAHxTqmeHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="368" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Search will provide links for users who need to book their tickets when selecting a result that best suits them. Joining this update, Google states it will add train route suggestions as an alternative when searching through the Flights app for a plane to catch.</p><p>Also rolling out today, users will find schedules for trains in 38 countries, including the U.S. For buses, Google is adding support to 15 countries, also including the U.S.</p><p>Google is also looking to increase awareness regarding airplane emissions. The post states that the company is bringing its Travel Impact Model (TIM) to its developer API. This will let app creators display flight emission information on their products or websites.</p><p>Additionally, developers can pick up a Google Sheets add-on and the TIM emissions calculator to help estimate a flight&apos;s amount per person. Google states this arrives as an additional tool alongside its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-google-travel-tips-and-tricks#section-get-the-best-deals-with-google-flights">Flights app</a>, which already displays such information for those who are curious.</p><p>These updates are rolling out today (Apr. 17) for users. If you&apos;re not yet seeing the features, give the app a little more time today and through the rest of the week.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps has new features for EV vehicle owners that provide them with useful information on their road trips.</li><li>Maps will provide accurate information about the EV charging points going forward.</li><li>It can include information such as the charging speed, what type of plug is used at the charging station, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps should help you find your electric vehicle charging station much easier on navigation as it is getting new features. These updates help users find information about the EV charging station and plan charging stops for road trips.</p><p>Google has announced that in the coming months, users can find AI-powered summaries in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, which describe an EV charger&apos;s specific location per user review so that they can easily spot the charging point. The example that the search giant cites is a multi-level parking lot, where finding the exact point can be tricky, and that is where the company&apos;s AI prowess comes into play.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:312px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:192.31%;"><img id="qXY8GD3VYJEoA7BvBqBZVD" name="google-maps-ai-summaries.jpg" alt="Google Maps AI Summaries" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXY8GD3VYJEoA7BvBqBZVD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="312" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The information is gathered from millions of user reviews on Google Maps, which will help pinpoint the charging spot for EV vehicle owners. Going forward, users can also witness additional details about which plug type will be available at such charging locations.</p><p>Moreover, finding EV charging information will be easier, especially when users&apos; vehicles are low on charge. Soon, users will be able to see nearby charges on "the in-car map" that showcases information like "real-time port availability and charging speed," notes Google in a press release. Users can expect the rollout to be global, particularly the vehicle owners with Google built-in in the coming months.</p>

<p>Another nifty addition comes to users when planning road trips, especially multi-stop ones. Google Maps will suggest suitable charging stops along the route, per the car battery&apos;s charge level. This new feature will also see the light of day globally in the coming months for vehicles with Google built-in.</p><p>Lastly, for users&apos; overnight stays during road trips, Google wants to save them from hunting for EV charging locations for the next morning; instead, it provides a new EV filter on the google.com/travel site where users can find hotels, which feature inside EV charging.</p><p>Google Maps recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-gets-three-new-updates">announced</a> three new updates for its users who plan trips, which included curated recommendations and customized lists. The latest release announced today is a plus for EV car owners to make their trip experience effortless. </p>

A full year of the basic Visible plan will cost $275 while 12 months of the Visible Plus plan will set you back $395 when you prepay. Since those two plans usually cost $25/month and $45/month, respectively, you could be looking at some serious savings. </p>

<p>Just a few weeks after rolling out an update that made their popular Plus plan even better, Visible has announced that they will begin offering annual payment options to new and existing wireless customers. Starting in May, pay for a full year in advance and you'll save 26% on the Visible Plus plan, no strings attached. </p>
<p>Both the Visible Basic plan and Visible Plus will remain otherwise unchanged, so if you prefer to pay monthly, you can continue to do so without any interruption. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ceb81ace-4bb7-417f-bd60-c6f93a630ada" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Save up to 26% when you pay for a full year of Visible in advance" data-dimension48="Save up to 26% when you pay for a full year of Visible in advance">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The best value here is obviously the Visible Plus plan. Paying for a full year in advance will save you a whopping $145, and you still get all of the monthly perks included in the plan, such as unlimited talk and text in over 30 countries worldwide, unlimited data on Verizon&apos;s Ultra Wideband 5G network, and 50GB of premium data every month.</p><p>Now that the March update has been implemented, the Visible Plus plan also comes with an unlimited mobile hotspot that&apos;s twice as fast as the basic Visible plan, and you&apos;ll get one Global Pass day per month (that&apos;s unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data across 140 countries).</p><p>If Visible wasn&apos;t home to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-mvno-deals-of-month-year-is-it-time-to-switch">best MVNO deals</a> before, it certainly is now. Will 2024 see more changes from the Verizon-powered wireless carrier? Only time will tell, but in the meantime, there&apos;s never been a better time to switch.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TECNO is emphasizing its camera-focused lineup with the launch of the Camon 30 Premier 5G.</li><li>The phone introduces TECNO's proprietary imaging system, promising groundbreaking features like 4K 30fps AI-noise reduction HDR video.</li><li>Beyond photography, the Camon 30 Premier excels in performance, with a large AMOLED display, MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate 5G chip, and ample RAM and storage options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO has finally launched the Camon 30 Premier 5G after showing it off during MWC 2024 in February, marking a big step for the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera-focused phone</a> lineup.</p><p>For the first time ever, the Camon 30 Premier 5G flaunts TECNO&apos;s very own imaging system. It&apos;s packing something TECNO claims is a game-changer, thanks to its 4K 30fps full-scene AI-noise reduction HDR video capability.</p><p>This means super crisp, detailed videos with true-to-life colors even if you&apos;re in dimmer settings, as per TECNO. This imaging setup, dubbed PolarAce, rocks Sony&apos;s CXD5622GG imaging chip to make all this happen. TECNO says you can even capture the breathtaking beauty of the auroras up north or the mesmerizing dusk scenes out in the desert.</p><p>On top of that, you&apos;ve got four 50MP lenses onboard, featuring a Sony IMX890 50MP OIS main camera. Additionally, there&apos;s a periscope-style telephoto lens thrown into the mix, giving you 3x optical zoom and 60x digital zoom. Plus, there&apos;s a macro lens in there too, promising to keep your subjects sharp even when you&apos;re just 2.5cm away.</p><p>Up front, the phone packs a punch with a 50MP selfie camera. It even tracks your eyes and focuses in a blink, so you&apos;ll always look your best in photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PkyKx4ZnE2KERdcZSYeN3Q" name="CAMON 30 Premier 5G-game.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PkyKx4ZnE2KERdcZSYeN3Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But a phone is more than just its camera, and the Camon 30 Premier seems to have all bases covered for reliable performance. It rocks a 6.77-inch 120Hz AMOLED display, powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate 5G chip, with a whopping 24GB of RAM (including 12GB of extended memory) and a generous 512GB of flash storage.</p><p>While it&apos;s not a flagship chipset, it promises to keep things running smooth, even when you&apos;re using tons of apps or games. Plus, it&apos;s got this 10-layer "gaming-grade" cooling system and a massive 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>The battery supports 70W charging, juicing the phone up from 0 to 50% in a mere 16 minutes. TECNO claims this battery can handle a whopping 1,600 charge cycles and will keep at least 80% of its health for a solid four years.</p><p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-30-series-launch">Camon 30 series that made its debut earlier this month</a>, the Premier model comes packed with AI-based tricks. One of these, called AI Erase, claims to zap away unwanted stuff from your photos. Also in the mix is a feature called Universal Tone, which supposedly uses AI to nail down accurate skin tones in your snaps, no matter your complexion.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G is hitting store shelves globally starting in May. Pricing will vary by region, and it&apos;s not yet confirmed if it will be available in the United States (past TECNO phones haven&apos;t been).</p>

That probably left you with some questions: Why is this a setting and shouldn&apos;t it just be better all the time?</p><p>Spoiler — it&apos;s all a lie. There is no way to add more memory to your phone, and the amount that was put in when it was built can&apos;t ever be changed. However, some software trickery that might boost performance in theory can be done. This is what you&apos;re seeing, and here&apos;s the scoop on what it does and if you really should use it.</p>
<h2 id="everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-ram-2">Everything you ever wanted to know about RAM</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.98%;"><img id="3MkApJuPKcSpnobRVkkR9o" name="Industry’s-First-8Gb-LPDDR4-Mobile-DRAM-01.jpg" alt="Samsung mobile RAM" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MkApJuPKcSpnobRVkkR9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="691" height="449" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RAM stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.crucial.com/articles/about-memory/support-what-does-computer-memory-do">Random Access Memory</a> and is hardware that every computer, including your phone, needs to operate. It&apos;s storage that holds data about the things you&apos;re doing and the apps you&apos;re actively using, and optimizing it is important because of its effect on performance.</p><p>RAM is fast. Your processor can communicate with it directly, and adding or retrieving data from it seems instant. There is no perceptible delay from the time the data moves in and out of RAM and the time whatever that does appears on your screen.</p>
<p>All operating systems have a way to manage how RAM is used, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/perf/lmkd">including Android</a>. Some of it has to be reserved for things like the cellular modem or video memory, so if your phone comes with 8GB of RAM, you only get to use about 6.5GB of it.</p><p>This is the portion used to load apps and their associated data. Your apps aren&apos;t installed in RAM (unless you&apos;ve done <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Oracle%20Linux%20and%20Virtualization/2349947_1.html">something crazy</a>) but they get loaded in when you open them. What I&apos;m saying is that having enough RAM and using it properly are important.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="64w2pHKfy7satmgYpcVq9g" name="oneplus-nord-n20-screenshot-ram-boost-how-to.jpg" alt="RAM Boost on OnePlus Nord N20" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/64w2pHKfy7satmgYpcVq9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1517" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are two things you might have heard before: "Android is Linux" and "free RAM is wasted RAM." Both are technically true, but it&apos;s really not that simple.</p><p>Android is not Linux the same way Ubuntu is Linux. Android is highly optimized for use in a low-power, low-resource system, and that means it manages memory very differently. A simple way to think of it is that your phone "learns" what apps you use and keeps those loaded into RAM so they can be opened instantly(ish). This is because of how it actually works — apps that are opened are kept in RAM until free space is needed, and then the app that&apos;s been there unused the longest gets purged to make room for something new. That&apos;s why people say free RAM is wasted.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel also can make use of a swap file. Windows and MacOS do the same. This is space on the storage drive that&apos;s marked to be used for storing apps and data for faster retrieval. If you open an app and it gets stored in the swap partition, it will load faster than it would if it weren&apos;t open at all.</p><p>This is what RAM Boost and other virtual memory features like it are really doing. And you&apos;re probably better off not using them at all.</p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-good-on-paper-2">It&apos;s good on paper</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nC9WCLHZkNDjx8mR8uQTQR" name="tortoise.jpg" alt="A baby tortoise" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nC9WCLHZkNDjx8mR8uQTQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4048" height="2277" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea of building a large dedicated space for data swapping on your storage drive is a good one. For you, it would allow more room to have more apps ready faster. Once all the technical details are addressed, it really does act like real physical RAM. That&apos;s why every computer does it on some level.</p><p>For the people who made your phone, it&apos;s a good way to spend less money and promise more performance. Companies know we love hearing that sort of thing, so they&apos;re more than happy to do it.</p>
<p>Your phone is not the same as a desktop PC, though, and using swap for application data transfer sucks — it&apos;s really, really slow. Slow 🐢. It&apos;s also unnecessary because Android was designed for phones without much memory, and it aggressively manages it all to compensate.</p><p>I&apos;m going to pick Motorola because I&apos;m more familiar with its RAM Boost feature, and it&apos;s the brand we tested here. Using RAM Boost makes a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a> worse, not better. Apps regularly glitch out or crash, and switching apps is slower with the feature enabled.</p>

<p>Why it&apos;s bad is easy to answer: the phone, like most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> with a virtual RAM feature, uses eMMC storage. This type of storage is notoriously slow and is in no way suited to act as any swap drive. Reading chunks of data is no faster than opening an app in the first place, and data transfer in and out isn&apos;t fast enough for an app that expects data in a certain amount of time.</p><p>Faster storage media, like UFS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/news-events/tech-blog/emmc-to-ufs-how-nand-memory-for-mobile-products-is-evolving/">would be better</a>, but it&apos;s still not nearly as fast as physical RAM. You would still see performance issues using a RAM-boosted application on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS storage</a> device.</p>
<p>This isn&apos;t why I recommend you not use the feature, though. You can make your phone as slow as you like because it&apos;s yours. I say don&apos;t use it because eMMC flash storage isn&apos;t designed to be used this way, and doing it will prematurely kill your phone.</p><p>This kind of flash storage has a usable life of between 3,000 and 10,000 cycles. that means you can write or read data from a storage block about 3,000 times before it starts to go bad, and by the 10,000th time, it&apos;s expected that the block is dead. This can be compounded by the way to controller handles reading and writing when the size of the data doesn&apos;t match the size of a block.</p><p>In layman&apos;s terms, you&apos;re going to wear out the storage of your phone using virtual RAM long before you would if you don&apos;t.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll be blunt: you can&apos;t expect the same performance from a budget phone that you would find in one that costs $1,000. We all know that.</p><p>If you are like me and love saving money and buying a good, cheap phone, accept and embrace it. You&apos;ll wait a second longer for an app to open, and your games won&apos;t run at 90 fps. That gives you time to think about the money you saved.</p><p>Using a feature like Motorola&apos;s RAM Boost isn&apos;t some magic fix and could wreck your phone long before you&apos;re ready to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-recycle-your-old-android-phone">recycle it</a>.</p>

<p>The best NAS for Plex should let you stream your media collection to all connected devices in your home. </p><p>Plex is a terrific platform that lets you manage your media library with ease, and the service has a ton of useful extras when it comes to video playback. The best part is that the Plex client is available on just about every platform, making it straightforward to stream your content. And you don&apos;t need to pay anything to get started. </p><p>Plex has a paid tier called Plex Pass that gives you a ton of additional features, including the ability to use hardware transcoding. If you have a lot of older media that needs to be transcoded before being played back on TVs or phones, you may want to go this route. But for a majority of users, the free Plex media server is going to be more than adequate. </p><p>You can do plenty of other things with a NAS, including backing up photos and videos from all of your phones, setting up virtual machines, access powerful productivity software that doesn&apos;t need any monthly fee, and a whole lot more. NAS servers designed for Plex tend to have powerful hardware in general, unlocking a suite of enticing use cases in addition to streaming media.</p><p>I tested dozens of NAS models over the course of the last three years, and these are the best Plex NAS servers you can buy today.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS224+ is the best choice if you want a powerful NAS with standout software. The NAS can easily handle Plex transcodes, the Intel hardware is terrific in daily use, and the 2-bay server is affordable enough while still offering all the features you'll actually use.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS423+ runs the same Intel hardware as the DS224+, so it holds up just as well for Plex media streaming. The difference is that you get four drive bays here, and the dual M.2 slots allow you to add SSD storage.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS923+ is a powerful 4-bay server that does an amazing job as a Plex media server. The Ryzen hardware is more powerful than its Intel rival, but the downside is that you miss on Plex transcodes. If you don't need the feature, the DS923+ is a fantastic choice.</p>

<p>If you need a Plex server on a budget, the DS223j has a lot to offer. It misses out on some of the advanced features that you get in costlier NAS servers, but as a basic home media streaming solution, it ticks all the right boxes.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re new to Plex and just want a NAS that lets you stream your media collection, you should get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DiskStation DS224+</a>. The NAS has two drive bays, is powered by Intel&apos;s reliable Celeron J4125 platform, and comes with 2GB of RAM as standard. You get dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, two USB ports, and the design has good passive ventilation along with a 92mm fan at the back that manages thermals well.</p><p>That said, the hardware isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find in this segment; you don&apos;t get any M.2 drives, and you miss out on multi-Gigabit connectivity. But it&apos;s all about achieving the right balance, and the DS224+ definitely manages to do that. Although it misses out on a few things, there are no issues with performance, and for most users, Gigabit Ethernet is still more than adequate.</p><p>Where the DS224+ truly shines is its ability as a Plex media server. The NAS has a native Plex client, and configuring it takes less than five minutes. And as it uses an Intel platform, you get hardware-based transcoding — if you have Plex Pass. Most users don&apos;t need to transcode content, but if you want to share your Plex library and have devices that can&apos;t play back the content natively, it comes in handy.</p><p>I tested Plex extensively on the DS224+, and the NAS does a terrific job playing back high bitrate 4K content without any issues. And if you need the feature, it holds up well with transcodes as well. Another standout feature is the software itself; the DS224+ runs DiskStation Manager (DSM), and it has an extensive suite of utilities that make a genuine difference — you won&apos;t get this level of polish with other brands. DSM also has useful mobile apps that let you access your data on the go.</p><p>Ultimately, the DS224+ is a powerful server that&apos;s a great choice for Plex, and you can&apos;t really go wrong with the NAS.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds423-plus-review">DiskStation DS423+</a> is nearly identical to the DS224+, and the key difference between the two is that the DS423+ has four drive bays, giving you the ability to house twice as much storage. You also get two M.2 slots on the underside, and that lets you use NVMe SSDs in addition to traditional hard drives.</p><p>The rest of the features are identical; the DS423+ uses the same Intel Celeron J4125 as the DS224+, you get 2GB of RAM, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and two USB ports. As it is a larger unit, there are two 92mm fans at the back. I would have liked to see at least one multi-Gigabit port — a lot of other 4-bay servers offer it as standard these days — but other than that, the hardware is pretty decent.</p><p>As the DS423+ uses the same Intel platform, it handles Plex in much the same fashion as the DS224+. I didn&apos;t run into any issues playing back 4K content, and transcoding worked reliably as well. And just like the DS224+, you get the same great feature-set within DSM, allowing you to do so much more in addition to Plex streaming.</p><p>If you like the look of the DS224+ but need M.2 slots or additional drive bays, the DiskStation DS423+ is the ideal choice.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5402T has the best hardware in its category, and the 2-bay NAS has everything you need in a Plex server. The Intel Celeron J5105 is outstanding in daily use, you get 4GB of RAM, four M.2 slots in total, and dual 2.5GbE ports as standard.

<p>I&apos;ve used enough TerraMaster NAS servers over the years to know that the brand prioritizes value, and that&apos;s no different with the F4-423.

The new interface is cleaner and easier to use, and it has useful features. It still doesn&apos;t quite have the same level of polish as other vendors, and the mobile utilities are lacking. That said, you get the basics, and it&apos;s clear that TerraMaster is intent on tweaking its software.</p><p>So if you want the best bargain out of a Plex server, just get the F4-423.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS9xx series has always been a best-seller, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> maintains that streak. The NAS now uses Ryzen hardware in lieu of Intel, and because it doesn&apos;t have an integrated GPU, you lose out on Plex transcoding. So if you absolutely need to use the feature, you should consider the DS423+ instead.</p><p>Although most models in this category have 2.5GbE or even 10GbE, the DS923+ is limited to dual Gigabit Ethernet ports. If you want multi-Gigabit connectivity, you&apos;ll need to pay another $100 to get a 10GbE network card and slot it into the NAS. So why should you consider the NAS? For starters, the AMD hardware is outstanding; it is noticeably faster in daily use, and that makes the DS923+ better-suited for demanding tasks.</p><p>And while you don&apos;t get Plex transcodes, the DS923+ is a standout choice for media streaming. It handles Plex playback without any issues whatsoever, doing a great job with high bitrate content across two devices at the same time. The DSM software is the best around, and because you get 4GB of RAM, you can run virtualization tasks and containers with relative ease.</p><p>There&apos;s also the ability to add more drive bays down the line; the DS923+ has four bays as standard, but you can buy an external housing like the DX517 and connect up to five additional drives to the NAS. It&apos;s this extensibility combined with the powerful hardware that gives it an edge over servers like the DS423+.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS223j doesn&apos;t have powerful hardware, but it still manages to do a great job when it comes to Plex. You can install the native Plex client and stream content to devices on your home network, but the Realtek hardware doesn&apos;t have transcoding.</p><p>You may think 1GB of RAM is too low, but it&apos;s more than adequate for the DSM software, and it is double that its predecessor — the DiskStation DS220j — offered. As it is an entry-level model, the DS223j doesn&apos;t have any upgradability; the RAM modules are soldered, and you can&apos;t add multi-Gigabit connectivity.</p><p>That said, if you just need an affordable NAS server to store your media collection and back up photos and videos, the DS223j is a good choice to consider. The DSM software is easily the best in this category, and while you don&apos;t get the more advanced features, all the basics are covered.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2>
<h2 id="what-makes-plex-such-a-good-media-server-2">What makes Plex such a good media server?</h2>
<p>As a high-level overview, Plex is a free media server utility that catalogs your media collection and makes it available for streaming on all of the connected devices in your home. </p><p>It is often considered to be the best media server around, and there are a few reasons for that. First up is the fact that it&apos;s available on just about any ecosystem: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Android TV, all streaming dongles, and most smart TVs. Basically, you can install Plex on all the devices you own. </p><p>Plex also does a great job with media organization. It sorts your music, movies, and TV shows into relevant categories, and adds high-resolution album art, covers, trailers, and metadata automatically. Also, as the content is streamed locally within your home network, it doesn&apos;t count toward your internet bandwidth costs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-plex-transcode-and-how-does-it-work-2">What is Plex transcode, and how does it work?</h2>
<p>The biggest reason for Plex&apos;s dominance has to do with the fact that it can play any file on any device. Plex has a powerful transcoding service baked in, and if you have the paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/plex-pass">Plex Pass</a> plan, you can unlock hardware acceleration — that makes a huge difference for transcoding 4K files.</p><p>Even if you&apos;re using an iPhone, iPad, Amazon tablet, an older smart TV, or an Android phone, you can confidently play your media library on any device without any issues. Plex handles transcodes automatically, so there&apos;s no intervention needed from your side — and that makes it a fantastic media streaming service. </p><p>Plex streaming generally falls into three categories:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Direct Play</strong>:<strong> </strong>This is when the Plex client (your TV or streaming box) natively handles the video container and just streams the file as-is without any issues. This uses minimal resources. </li><li><strong>Direct Stream</strong>: In this scenario, the client device you're using can play the video and audio streams, but does not work with the container (like .mkv or .m4a), so Plex will copy those streams to a compatible container and send it to your device. This mode uses a few resources, but it isn't demanding on the server. </li><li><strong>Transcode</strong>: This is where things get interesting. Plex will transcode files when a client device is unable to play the video or audio streams at all. This is due to the lack of audio or video codecs (like H.265, HEVC, H.264) on the client device, and in this situation Plex converts the video to a file that can be played on the device. This is the most CPU-intensive option and needs a powerful NAS. </li></ul>

<p>There are a few things you&apos;ll need to pay attention to if you&apos;re interested in a Plex NAS. </p>
<h2 id="cpu-2">CPU</h2>
<p>This is a key consideration when choosing a Plex NAS, as you&apos;ll need a powerful CPU for transcodes. Most servers over $400 meet this criteria, but as a general rule, you&apos;ll need a recent Intel chipset — Celeron models are good for home use, but if you&apos;re sharing your Plex server with friends and family and need more bandwidth, you&apos;ll need to look at servers featuring Intel Core hardware.</p><p>While AMD has made inroads into the NAS category , Intel is still king here. If you want the ability to transcode 4K content in Plex, you&apos;ll need to buy a NAS server with a recent-gen Intel Celeron or Core CPU.</p>
<h2 id="memory-2">Memory</h2>
<p>Basically, you&apos;ll need a decent amount of RAM to make sure there are no bottlenecks. Plex isn&apos;t memory-intensive, but if you have a lot of other services running on the NAS, it could become an issue. Generally, 2GB of RAM is the bare minimum in this category, and if you&apos;re looking to run a lot of services, I&apos;d suggest getting an 8GB memory module and slotting it in. </p><p>Most NAS servers let you upgrade the RAM with ease, so you shouldn&apos;t have any issues slotting in 8GB or more memory within the server should you need it. </p>
<h2 id="connectivity-2">Connectivity</h2>
<p>Most NAS servers have two Gigabit ports as standard, and that should be adequate for home use. But if you&apos;re sharing your Plex instance and need additional bandwidth, you should look at a server with 2.5GbE or even 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. </p><p>That said, if you switch to a NAS with multi-Gigabit connectivity, you&apos;ll need to simultaneously upgrade your switch and router to take full advantage of the additional bandwidth on offer. It isn&apos;t as costly as it used to be to switch to a 10GbE home network, but you&apos;ll have to take those additional costs into consideration. For now, Gigabit Ethernet is more than adequate for handling a few Plex 4K streams without any issues. </p><p>Some NAS models feature an HDMI port that lets you connect the server to a TV or monitor. This is useful as you can then play the media stored on the NAS directly without having to stream it wirelessly on your home network. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-best-plex-server-2">What is the best Plex server?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of options if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best NAS for home</a> use, and you can choose between entry-level picks that have a single or two drive bays, and there are four-bay models that are designed to last. </p><p>But if you&apos;re in the best Plex server, there are a few additional points to consider. For one thing, Plex transcoding is a very CPU-intensive task, so you will need to look at NAS enclosures that have a powerful chipset. Thankfully, the biggest NAS manufacturers — Synology, QNAP, and ASUSTOR — deliver models catered for Plex media streaming. </p><p>Synology&apos;s DiskStation DS224+ illustrates this point perfectly — the two-bay NAS server features the Intel Celeron J4125 and handles Plex native streaming as well as transcoding without breaking a sweat. </p><p>If you want a little more room, the DiskStation DS423+ has four bays that can hold up to 64TB of storage in total. The rest of the features as the same as the DS224+, but you get two M.2 slots. </p>

<p>Right now, if you&apos;re looking to pick up a NAS for Plex streaming, the best option is the DiskStation DS224+. The upgraded internal hardware makes it an enticing model in this category, and with two Gigabit Ethernet ports and robust software features, the NAS has all the basics covered.</p><p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5402T is a really good contender as well, and it delivers the best hardware package in this segment. </p>
<h2 id="our-testing-methodology-for-the-best-plex-server-2">Our testing methodology for the best Plex server</h2>
<p>There are a few things I consider when deciding what NAS servers to recommend for Plex streaming. First up is the CPU; I run a few synthetic tests to determine its performance potential, looking at single and multi-core scores. </p><p>Then I set up a native Plex install on the NAS and run multimedia streaming tests to see resource usage in real-world scenarios when streaming 720p, 1080p, and 4K files on the local network. </p><p>I also evaluate transcoding potential by streaming a 4K file to a device that doesn&apos;t handle the native container — this is a great way to determine if the NAS can handle on-the-fly transcodes for 4K files with high bitrates. </p><p>Finally, I look at sequential read/write potential by transferring an image library containing over 5,000 files (all under 1MB), and a dozen media files over 1GB in size. </p><p>Ultimately, the best Plex server needs to be able to stream your local media library to all devices on your home network (and over the internet), and it should be able to do so consistently for several years. </p><p>All of the NAS models highlighted in this post can do just that, so if you&apos;re looking to get your hands on a Plex NAS server, you can go ahead and pick up any models in this list with confidence. </p>

<ul><li>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 has reportedly appeared in two databases as Google proceeded with its charging case certification.</li><li>The listings show the case may feature a 650mAh battery capacity, which would be a 30mAh increase from 2022.</li><li>Little else is known about the buds, but there are specs from its original iteration to look back on.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information about Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel Buds Pro model has appeared following its certification appearance overseas.</p><p>The assumed charging case for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 was spotted on UL Demko (Denmark) and Safety Korea, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-battery-leaked/">91Mobiles</a>. Regarding the former, the case&apos;s listing shows model number GH8TQ, with the database stating it features a rechargeable Li-ion battery.</p><p>What&apos;s important here is that the charging case has been given a battery capacity of 650mAh.</p><p>A photo of the Pixel Buds Pro 2&apos;s battery for its charging case appeared on Safety Korea&apos;s listing. However, further images of the device (such as its case) weren&apos;t spotted in the database as Google continued the certification process.</p><p>More information regarding the Buds wasn&apos;t detailed in the assumed Pro 2 listing, either. The publication speculates that the upcoming device could launch sometime after I/O 2024 in May, which would (ideally) feature its official launch. Rumors add that the device could be delayed and withheld until Google&apos;s fall launch of the Pixel 9 series.</p>

<p>While rumors of the new device are limited, we have the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a> from 2022 to look back on. The original device featured a charging case with a 620mAh battery, which means the rumors could spell a 30mAh boost if true. As the publication notes, the Buds Pro could deliver 31 extra hours of battery. The increase might see that number increased slightly, but we&apos;ll have to wait to be sure.</p><p>Moreover, the original Buds Pro could last for around 11 hours with ANC disabled and seven with it on. If Google is looking to boost its case&apos;s battery, then perhaps there&apos;s more in store for the buds, too.</p><p>Also, with Google&apos;s newfound endeavors with AI, perhaps we&apos;re looking at a chance for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to impact the Buds Pro 2.</p><p>It remains to be seen what Google is preparing to bring for I/O 2024. It was rumored that the company&apos;s fall event could be packed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-successor-name-change-rumors">upcoming Fold successor</a> could shift toward that later section of the year. If Google does delay its Buds Pro 2 launch until the fall, then we might see even more excitement.</p>

<ul><li>Digging through Android's code seemingly unearthed Google's work at implementing a new satellite SOS UI.</li><li>The UI will guide users through a setup process as they must align their phones with a satellite to begin communicating with emergency services.</li><li>Google is preparing to bring satellite connectivity capabilities with Android 15 and with its upcoming Tensor G4 chip for the Pixel 9.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some digging into Google&apos;s code seems to have unearthed an alleged first look at how users will get its Android satellite connectivity to work.</p><p>According to Google News <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/4004">on Telegram</a>, users will have to keep their phones in line with satellites floating in low orbit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/pixel_9s_satellite_sos_interface_is_in_the_works_heres_what_it_looks_like_now-news-62447.php">GSMArena</a>). During setup, the code shows that users will be prompted to "get a clear view of the sky" by avoiding obstructions like buildings, trees, and mountains. </p><p>Once done, users will be given a UI page with a large circle in its center. Its purpose is to aid users in locating a satellite in their vicinity. A stronger connection will be obtained by ensuring you&apos;re facing the satellite straight on, meaning it&apos;s in the center of the radius.</p><p>The post adds that users can minimize this SOS page when connected to continue texting emergency services or family members. Android will turn the page into a floating display on a device&apos;s homepage, similar to a widget.
