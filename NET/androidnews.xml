                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you put most book-style foldable phones next to each other, you&apos;ll notice a trend. Most of them are tall and narrow when closed, which allows them to be a bit more square when unfolded. To me, this has always felt like the wrong design decision, as it was one that tried to stick as close to a "regular" smartphone design rather than playing to the strengths of a book-style foldable.</p><p>That is until the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a> came along in 2023. Oft-rumored and substantially delayed past its original release, the Pixel Fold opted for a squat, wide design that unfolded into a landscape almost 16:9 aspect ratio, much more closely mimicking a tablet than other book-style foldables.</p><p>But its sequel, the awkwardly named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, decided to act more like other foldables I&apos;ve used and forget the unique identity of its predecessor. While Google may have improved many other aspects of its latest foldable, the wrong choice was to go for a more "traditional" foldable phone design. Here&apos;s why I want to see Google go back to a wider design for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

<h2 id="it-apos-s-better-for-apps-2">It&apos;s better for apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-display-unfolded-reading-google-books.jpg" alt="Reading a book on the Google Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the key takeaways from my original Pixel Fold review was that the wide aspect ratio wasn&apos;t just great for apps on the outer screen but better on the inner display, as well. But this wasn&apos;t inherently because the screen was <em>wider</em>. Rather, it was because opening the Pixel Fold made apps think you were suddenly using a tablet in landscape mode.</p><p>In fact, the only other foldable that was like this was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-review">Oppo Find N2</a>, and that device was never released outside of China.</p><p>That last part is the most important part of the Pixel Fold&apos;s design, as it ensures that the giant screen is used correctly. Every other foldable on the market still acts like a giant smartphone when opened up. It&apos;s essentially a "wide portrait" screen, and it makes many apps feel awkward and useless when opening them on the big screen.</p><p>Take Gmail, for example. While Google worked to ensure that many of its apps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-apps-redesigned-for-foldable-phones">started behaving more like tablet apps</a> when opened on big foldable displays, Gmail still thinks it&apos;s being opened on a normal tall, narrow smartphone screen even though it&apos;s being displayed on a big, wide foldable display. That is unless you&apos;re opening it on the original Pixel Fold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tqerr5n64PjMStH4NiH3Am" name="google-pixel-fold-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-gmail.jpg" alt="Comparing Gmail on the Google Pixel Fold and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tqerr5n64PjMStH4NiH3Am.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the Pixel Fold, Gmail opens up in the proper landscape tablet dual-pane view, giving you the list of folders and tags on the left, while the open email or list of emails resides on the right side. Sure, you could get this same view if you rotated your open foldable 90 degrees sideways, but I&apos;d rather it just open the right way <em>the first time.</em></p><p>When I&apos;ve got a big foldable screen, I expect to have a more efficient workflow than when on a smaller phone screen. In other words, I shouldn&apos;t need to pull out the slide-out menu on the left. It should just be there. This also keeps me from having to constantly navigate forward and backward when reading emails, as emails open next to my inbox instead of on top of it.</p><p>Another example is the YouTube app, which actually opens in tablet view no matter which way you rotate a foldable, but videos themselves work better on the Pixel Fold&apos;s aspect ratio when using them in "flex" mode. That&apos;s when you fold the display at an angle and use the bottom half like a kickstand to watch a video or play a game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aXRKfspxkSNQCs8FcK9ggk" name="google-pixel-fold-honor-magic-v3-youtube-video.jpg" alt="Comparing a YouTube video's aspect ratio on the Google Pixel Fold and the Honor Magic V3 when in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aXRKfspxkSNQCs8FcK9ggk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original Google Pixel Fold displays the video on the entire half of the screen, while every other foldable I&apos;ve used has black bars on the side because the display doesn&apos;t have the right aspect ratio for this purpose. The example above is the Pixel Fold next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Honor Magic V3</a>, but this particular problem occurs on all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a>.</p><p>One more example is Discord, which is generally a terrible app to use on book-style folding phones because it&apos;s so darn buggy. But using it on the Pixel Fold is less problematic on the big screen because it actually fits the entire chat, plus the navigation pane and server list on that beautiful, wide inner display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b3ywRgNKzH8gj5SZQt4jvk" name="google-pixel-fold-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-discord.jpg" alt="Comparing Discord on the Google Pixel Fold and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b3ywRgNKzH8gj5SZQt4jvk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Comparing Discord on the Google Pixel Fold (left) and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the chat gets cut off because of the narrower aspect ratio. To see the entire chat, you actually need to slide the side panel back of the screen to the left, leaving a giant chat window to take over your screen and waste a lot of space.</p><p>While a notable number of apps have worked to fix these issues over the past year since the original Pixel Fold launched, there are still plenty that don&apos;t behave as expected on large foldable phones.</p><p>Developers can, of course, opt into showing tablet UIs when large screens are present but it doesn&apos;t fix the inherent problem of displays that are too tall and not wide enough. The original Pixel Fold fixed this, but I&apos;m afraid no other company will have the courage—Google included—to attempt the same move again, and that&apos;s a real shame.</p>

You can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sarahandersencomics.aninfinitestory.io/#/"><strong>check out the comic for yourself</strong></a> at that link, and start exploring.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/aninfinitestory/">An Infinite Story</a>, the team behind the infinite storytelling platform, has shown off demos with Disney art and real-life sports superstars like LeBron James and Tom Brady, but it&apos;s looking to partner closely with artists like Andersen to create interactive worlds that go beyond the usual comic-panel format you see with webcomics.</p><p>Essentially, any tiny dot or line on the canvas may hold entire art pieces and worlds, so you&apos;re encouraged to pinch-and-zoom onto every area to catch all the Easter eggs. For this demo, you must count every single hidden cat, and those that score closest to the correct number are entered into a contest to win prizes like signed books or original art drawn by Andersen.</p>

<p>I had the chance to sit down with Andersen and Infinite Story co-founder Bobby Chiu, an Emmy-winning artist who designed characters for Tim Burton&apos;s Alice In Wonderland and works on other Hollywood animated movies like Super Mario Bros.</p><p>I confirmed that "After Owning a Cat" had no generative AI elements; instead, it takes preexisting art from Sarah&apos;s Scribbles with its "original aesthetic and style," then places them in the wider canvas, while adding new art with the same aesthetic style made in collaboration by Andersen, Chiu, and other team members. It&apos;s an "expansion on a creative process" that "feels new and innovative,” says Andersen.</p><p>Long-time Sarah&apos;s Scribbles fans will recognize strips and "characters" like her pets and various body parts, as this experience pays homage to them. But it has an Inception-like theme where the deeper you go, the more the world of Sarah&apos;s Scribbles takes on a bizarre feline spin you&apos;ve never seen before in the comic. </p><p>The "cat takeover" theme offers a unique twist to the usual hidden-art-game formula, and it allowed Andersen to try a different kind of storytelling with a "unifying narrative" than she can normally accomplish with a few comic panels.</p><p>Andersen is excited to use this same format for future comic tie-ins. I asked if she might bring in other Sarah&apos;s Scribbles themes like cryptids or uterus woes for a hidden-art comic; she laughed at the idea of a whole anatomy-themed experience, but mentioned that she&apos;s working on other new comics — including one with a fantasy theme — that could use this format to build backstory and character ideas that&apos;ll make their way into the comic.</p>

<p>As for how the Infinite Story platform works, Chiu and fellow engineer Josh Tyler didn&apos;t share too many details, except that it&apos;s WebGL platform agnostic and is best suited for mobile pinch-and-zoom (though you can experience it with a computer trackpad too).</p><p>This Sarah&apos;s Scribbles demo is essentially a trial run for them, and they designed it to be "easy" for users to find every hidden nook and cranny, with shining icons that appear if you&apos;re stuck. Eventually, they intend to add "new game modes" like "puzzlers, time trials, web comics, and cooperative treasure hunts" that provide more challenge and encourage more free exploration.</p>

<p>Hidden object game companies and webcomic apps like Webtoons would probably jump at the chance to incorporate this tech, so I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if An Infinite Story tech ends up in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> of the future, if not hosted on their own app for unique experiences.</p><p>Either way, it&apos;s an intriguing new gaming/ storytelling format that puts more emphasis on lovingly recreating art instead of "borrowing" it via genAI, and I think that&apos;s pretty neat. I&apos;m excited to see what other artists end up using this format.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Garmin InReach Messenger Plus is Garmin's "first satellite communicator with photo and voice messaging in addition to global two-way texting, location sharing, and SOS."</li><li>You can now provide more context during an SOS, such as describing the problem or taking a photo of your location.</li><li>Garmin promises IPX7 water resistance and 600 hours of battery life with 10-minute check-ins or a year in standby mode.</li><li>The InReach Messenger Plus costs $499, plus $14.99/month or more for satellite.</li></ul>
<p>The Garmin InReach Messenger Plus is a portable satellite communications device that lets you message family, share your location, or call 24/7 emergency services through your phone over satellite. It&apos;s quite similar to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/is-garmin-inreach-messenger-worth-buying">InReach Messenger</a>, except that it now supports multimedia instead of text characters alone.</p><p>Through the Garmin Messenger app on your smartphone, you&apos;ll be able to send full photos, 30-second voice clips, or 1,600-character messages to friends and family so they&apos;re kept in the loop on your no-signal excursion. The InReach Messenger Plus acts as a satellite relay — assuming you pay for the subscription. </p><p>Like the original InReach Messenger, the Messenger Plus has a covered SOS button you can open up and trigger to signal for help, as well as a tiny MIP LCD for showing information like weather or incoming messages. You can technically send messages on the device itself with the left/ right/ OK buttons, but you&apos;ll need your phone for the new messaging features.</p><p>During SOS calls, you&apos;ll now be able to send voice messages and photos to Garmin Response, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-2023-sos-report-shows-how-satellite-saves-lives">responded to 14,500 SOS activations thus far</a>. This could provide useful context that text alone couldn&apos;t, which might make the Plus worth the extra cost.</p>

<p>Both InReach Messenger models have IPX7 water resistance for a decent amount of ruggedness on the trail. They both weigh about 4oz, with 1.08" diagonal (160 x 68) displays.</p><p>The Messenger Plus lasts 600 hours (25 days) with 10-minute check-ins or 120 hours with 2-minute check-ins; the original Messenger lasted 28 days or 144 hours in the same conditions, so the new model must use more battery in exchange for smarter messages.</p><p>You can use either for "Safety Charging," topping off your dead smartphone via the included cable. You can also check weather forecasts over the InReach network.</p><p>Unlike the original InReach Messenger, the Messenger Plus has an actual compass instead of a GPS compass while moving, as well as Garmin Explore app support. This enables features like turn-by-turn routing, searchable POIs, courses, and satellite imagery of your surroundings.</p><p>Overall, the Garmin InReach Messenger Plus has the same primary purposes as its predecessor, only with better smartphone connectivity. Aside from messaging, it tracks your GPS location and sends it to the Garmin Explore app on your smartphone, where you can download and follow offline maps or broadcast your real-time location to loved ones. </p><p>While this device costs much more than the original InReach Messenger, it&apos;s slightly less costly than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">Garmin GPSMAP 67i</a> handheld with satellite that&apos;s designed as an all-in-one, standalone device without needing your smartphone. The Messenger Plus lets you use a touchscreen device you&apos;re more familiar with.</p><p>We recently learned that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-pixel-9s-satellite-sos-runs-on-tech-from-skylo-and-garmin">Pixel 9&apos;s satellite tech uses Garmin Response</a>, but with Skylo&apos;s satellite data. Since increasingly more smartphones use satellite tech, this device feels like a direct response, adding support for multimedia that a smartphone could handle easily.</p><p>The biggest knock against the InReach Messenger Plus will be its price: $499, plus the need to pay at least $15/month for satellite connectivity. I&apos;d say it&apos;s primarily designed for those who spend long stretches off the cellular grid, but want to stay better connected with family during those stretches. For those people, it&apos;ll be worth the high cost.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google, Masimo, and Qualcomm are working together to boost health tracking on Wear OS with new, premium features.</li><li>Google’s new partnership means it has licensed Masimo’s blood oxygen tech, plus other health features.</li><li>Masimo’s new platform will work well with Wear OS, providing accurate health tracking and smooth Android syncing.</li><li>Manufacturers can design their smartwatch exteriors and interfaces, but Masimo handles the internal tech design and testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google and Masimo have teamed up to create a reference framework that helps manufacturers speed up the development of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> smartwatches.</p><p>You might remember Masimo as the company that sued Apple, pushing for an import ban on the Apple Watch. The medical tech company claimed Apple used its blood oxygen tracking technology without permission.</p><p>Sales of the Apple Watch were briefly halted, but instead of agreeing to a licensing deal, Apple disabled the blood oxygen feature across all Watch models to ease the legal tensions.</p><p>Recently, Google enlisted Masimo and Qualcomm to create health-focused reference platforms for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/16/wear-os-health-reference-platform-google-masimo/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This partnership aims to boost Google’s vision for advanced health tracking and bringing premium features to its wearable platform.</p><p>While Google takes charge of the Wear OS experience, the smartwatch makers are still responsible for building and integrating fitness tracking from scratch.</p><p>The variety of health tracking options across different price ranges benefits consumers but also leaves room for cost-cutting by manufacturers. The challenge is that it’s tough for users to determine how effective or reliable these features are before buying.</p><p>Thanks to the new partnership, Google has secured a license for Masimo&apos;s blood oxygen tracking tech that Apple sidestepped, along with a range of other health features.</p><p>As per Masimo’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240913710494/en/" target="_blank">press release</a>, the new reference platform is designed to fit right in with the Wear OS ecosystem. It offers a bunch of health tracking tools, such as Masimo’s biosensing tech, that aim for accurate data and easy syncing with Android phones.</p><p>According to the announcement, manufacturers using the new reference platforms and Masimo’s tech can still design and build their smartwatch exteriors and user interfaces as they like. But for the internal parts, like Snapdragon chips and Masimo’s biosensors, Masimo will take care of all the design, production, and testing.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smart rings are on the rise, and while the likes of Oura and Ultrahuman have an early-mover advantage, the arrival of Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> has catalyzed this category. I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman&apos;s Ring Air</a> for most of the year now, and it is genuinely one of the best wearables I tested.</p><p>Noise is looking to get in on the action with the introduction of the Luna Ring. The brand is a leading wearable manufacturer in India, and it predominantly caters to the entry-level and budget categories. It is looking to undercut Ultrahuman by a sizeable amount, with the Luna Ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gonoise.com/products/luna-smart-ring">available in the country for ₹19,999 ($238)</a>. By contrast, the Ultrahuman Ring Air <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/ULTRAHUMAN-Ring-AIR-Sleep-Tracking-Subscription/dp/B0CHF4P1G9">retails for ₹28,499 ($340)</a>.</p><p>The affordability makes the Luna Ring enticing, and after using the smart ring for a month, I can admit that the hardware is just as polished as the Ring Air. The Luna Ring is available in five color options — silver, gold, gold, black, and matte black — and weighs just three to four grams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bnN3njVVjCY7FEfHppzccG" name="noise-luna-ring-2.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bnN3njVVjCY7FEfHppzccG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis is made out of titanium, and the inner casing has a plastic finish and includes a heart rate sensor, blood oxygen sensor, skin temperature sensor, and an accelerometer. The sensor suite is standard stuff, and like the Ring Air, the Luna Ring doesn&apos;t look or feel like a smart ring.</p><p>It is a little wider than regular rings, but other than that, it isn&apos;t immediately evident that you&apos;re wearing a smart ring. The PVD coating is decent, but like other smart rings, it picks up scratches in daily use. Other than that, I don&apos;t have any issues with the design itself; Noise did a good job in this area, and the Luna Ring looks just as elegant as its rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bPaZonPZTXwnmZg7ERr8uH" name="noise-luna-ring-8.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring on the charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPaZonPZTXwnmZg7ERr8uH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big allure of smart rings is the ability to measure activity and health metrics without using a bulky smartwatch or a fitness band, and the Luna Ring gets the basics right. It measures heart rate continually, and you get to see skin temperature readings, SpO2 levels, and activity throughout the course of a day.</p><p>There is some variability to heart rate measurements when seen against the Ring Air, but the margin of error isn&apos;t high. The bigger issue is that activity monitoring is inconsistent, particularly with cardio workouts; I use an exercise bike indoors, and the Luna Ring&apos;s data was in line with that of basic fitness bands.</p><p>It is still usable if you just need a broad overview of your workouts, but if you want accurate heart rate measurements and training load, you have to get a smartwatch. The Ring Air had similar issues with activity monitoring, but a slew of software updates made a real difference, and while it still isn&apos;t anywhere as good as a smartwatch, it has a definite lead over the Luna Ring in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qvzJfxBiY6G5Pg2YxZ4LoG" name="noise-luna-ring-3.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring next to device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvzJfxBiY6G5Pg2YxZ4LoG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Luna Ring comes into its own is sleep tracking; it is much less annoying than wearing a smartwatch to bed, and Noise&apos;s sleep metrics are decent. You get good insights into your sleep cycle, and you get a score along with suggestions on how to get better rest. On that note, the brand collates activity and health data to provide a readiness score, and it is pretty good too.</p><p>Because there isn&apos;t any panel on the smart ring, you don&apos;t get any notifications or alerts on your finger, and you&apos;ll need to use the app to track activity data. The interface itself is clean, and it connects to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sync-your-fitness-band-google-fit">Google Fit</a>, but there isn&apos;t much in the way of customizability. What&apos;s particularly annoying is that the app inundates you with notifications about connecting to the Luna Ring, and I had to disable the notification channel an hour after I started using the smart ring.</p><p>Also, you will need to give the app access to the alarm permission, and that isn&apos;t something I had to do with most other wearables. I don&apos;t see why Noise needs this as you can&apos;t set alarms on the ring itself, and it is irksome. I didn&apos;t see many issues with connectivity, but there were occasions when data wouldn&apos;t sync with the app automatically.</p>

<p>Battery life is another area where the Luna Ring doesn&apos;t quite measure up. Noise touts five-day battery life between charges, but in my usage, the Luna Ring barely made it past two days before it needed to be plugged in. That&apos;s a day less than what I get out of the Ring Air, and while it&apos;s still better than smartwatches, battery longevity isn&apos;t as good as its rivals.</p><p>And then there&apos;s the charging situation. You&apos;ll need to line up the sensors with the ridges on the charging stand, and even after doing that, the ring wouldn&apos;t charge. I had to fiddle with the positioning before I could get the ring to charge, and that was the case with every charge cycle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pg57BnKf6uXwgHis9wqnSG" name="noise-luna-ring-1.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring next to charging station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pg57BnKf6uXwgHis9wqnSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It would have been easier to recommend the Luna Ring if it were a smidgen more affordable — ideally around ₹16,000 ($191). Because as it stands, I don&apos;t see the smart ring nailing the brief. It has a lightweight design and is comfortable to wear throughout the day, and I like what Noise did with the sleep metrics and readiness score. That said, activity monitoring is unreliable at best, and the battery doesn&apos;t last as long as I imagined.</p><p>The biggest issue is the notification spam; yes, I know this can be addressed by muting notifications, but I shouldn&apos;t have to do that. If you&apos;re in India and are mulling a smart ring, Ultrahuman&apos;s Ring Air is still the better choice — it is costlier, but you&apos;re getting a much better product overall. If you need something on a budget, I&apos;d suggest waiting until the Luna Ring gets a decent discount. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google was spotted rolling out an audio feature addition to Android 15 to prepare for its official launch.</p><p>Android 15 is beginning to receive an update containing the return of the "Noise Control" option for connected audio devices. As detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1835432242858152229">Mishaal Rahman</a> on X, this button should give users easier control over the ANC and transparency modes of earbuds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>In the volume panel, users will find the Noise Control option in line with Spatial Audio and Live Captions. Tapping the new button will show the previously mentioned earbud modes alongside an "off" option.</p><p>Android 15 originally missed this option due to a redesign.

<p>Google was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-volume-panel-redesign-collapsible">rolling out a redesign</a> for Android 15&apos;s volume panel in April during Developer Preview 2.

With the choice to expand or shrink the redesigned panel, switching to a set of Pixel Buds Pro saw the exclusion of Noise Control.</p><p>Rahman adds that the button, or "Slice," is brought about thanks to the Pixel Buds app to bring control of the earbuds to the volume panel. Google&apos;s return of the option brings some much-needed convenience back to the volume panel.</p><p>In other news, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a> for enrolled testers last week.

<ul><li>Early rumors about the next ASUS ROG Phone suggest there will be a display "upgrade."</li><li>Rumors fail to detail those upgrades; however, a database listing shows the phone will likely sport 65W charging again.</li><li>The ROG Phone 8 series was a drastic shift in design from the Phone 7 as ASUS revamped the display, thinned the device, and changed its rear LEDs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like it&apos;s that time again for ROG Phone rumors, as a new post claims the next device could sport a worthy change.</p><p>Early leaks stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/5888095979/OxfJpuown?pagetype=groupfeed">Smart Pikachu&apos;s</a> post on Weibo, claiming the ROG Phone 9 could see an "upgrade" to its display (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rog-phone-9-leak-specs-3482187/">Android Authority</a>). Unfortunately, the tipster didn&apos;t specify what this updated display could look like. The publication speculates the Phone 9 could grab a "brighter," "higher resolution" display compared to the Phone 8 series.</p><p>The tipster did provide a snapshot of ASUS pushing the alleged ROG Phone 9 through China&apos;s Quality Certification Centre. Per the listing, it seems the device will continue to feature 65W wired fast charging. Details about its battery capacity, which comments questioned, were unavailable.</p><p>Moreover, it seems the device was tagged with model number ASUSAI2501A.</p><p>Other rumors suggest the device will feature 24GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage. These numbers are likely of the device&apos;s maximum configuration. For comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8 Pro</a> offered similar options, though its base offerings were 12/256GB.</p><p>The ROG Phone 9 is rumored to grab Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, which is set to debut in October.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="tQoTc7NeiKXk2bEHQ2nhuD" name="asus-rog-phone-9-early-rumors.jpg" alt="A set of early rumors stating the ASUS ROG Phone 9 could feature a display upgrade and 65W charging." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQoTc7NeiKXk2bEHQ2nhuD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smart Pikachu / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding the supposed display upgrade, the Phone 8 delivered a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED display with FHD+. At its max, the device could provide a 165Hz refresh rate, which, considering its focus on gaming, is like a dream for mobile gamers. ASUS also protected the device&apos;s front panel with Corning&apos;s Gorilla Glass 2.</p><p>When ASUS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-launch-date-teaser">teased the device</a>, the company showed off its smaller bezels, turning its display into a more immersive experience. The slight "chin" on the top and bottom of the ROG Phone 7 was gone as ASUS brought in that punch-hole selfie camera.</p><p>The soon-to-be predecessor also features 65W wired fast charging. That speed helps recharge the 5,500mAh battery quickly — and it&apos;s the battery capacity that we&apos;re still wondering about for the Phone 9.</p><p>The design of the Phone 8 was also radically different compared to the devices before it. During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-series-launch">its launch</a>, ASUS showed off its minimalistic back panel outfitted with a set of 341 programmable LEDs known as "AniMe Vision." The Phone 8 and 8 Pro packed a load of AI-backed programs like "X Capture" to record highlights during intense moments and AI Grabber for quick game-related searches.</p><p>With such radical changes, what ASUS has planned for the Phone 9 series is still anyone&apos;s guess.</p>

<ul><li>A few Galaxy S25 Plus renderings have leaked and suggest design cues similar to the other two series devices.</li><li>The phone is rumored to arrive slightly thinner than the 2024 model with all-black camera sensors, flat sides, and rounded corners.</li><li>Another leak claimed the phone may stick with the 4,900mAh battery; however, its charging strength wasn't stated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We might have the entire Galaxy S25 series to look at now as an alleged rendering of the Plus model surfaces.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-2025">Android Headlines</a>, known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1836060662511923515">OnLeaks</a> provided a glimpse into the potential design changes of the Galaxy S25 Plus. At first glance, the device may (unsurprisingly) stick to a design similar to leaked renders of the other two series models. The Galaxy S25 Plus is rumored to feature a clean rear panel with a triple vertical camera array that sees a slight change.</p><p>The lenses are purported to debut with a thicker black ring around each lens. It&apos;d be quite a change <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">over the Galaxy  S24 Plus</a> and the S24 series in general as those phones had a thinner, shimmering outline much closer to the lens.</p><p>A 6.7-inch display might greet consumers once more while rumors add the S25 Plus could see a "marginal" dimension change. According to the post, the phone might arrive 0.4mm thinner than 2024&apos;s iteration. The device&apos;s rumored dimensions are as follows: 158.4 x 75.7 x 7.3mm. These are ever-so-slightly lower than its predecessor&apos;s 158.5 x 75.9 x 7.7 mm measurements.</p><p>The rendering suggests the Plus model will continue to feature rounded corners alongside flat sides, which has recently become a trend for Samsung. Overall, these alleged S25 Plus renders theorize a device that will mirror its predecessor, except for the potential camera lens ring swap.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication spotted Ice Universe&apos;s speculation on the phone&apos;s battery capacity (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-battery-capacity-leaked/">SamMobile</a>). Speculation states the S25 Plus will feature a 4,900mAh battery, the same as the S24 version.</p>

<p>It might not be a surprise that Samsung may stick with the same battery capacity as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-wont-probably-blow-your-mind-with-its-battery-life">a previous rumor</a> stated a similar future for the Ultra model. The top-of-the-line edition could stick with the same 5,000mAh battery paired with 45W wired charging. Ice Universe&apos;s recent post on X claims the vanilla S25 will also stick with the same 4,000mAh capacity.</p><p>Charging strengths for the Plus and vanilla models weren&apos;t stated, though it&apos;s hard to see Samsung changing them.</p><p>What is (apparently) changing are the camera rings for the upcoming S25 series. A previous set of renderings leaked for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">the base S25</a>, showing a similar tune. That device was rumored to debut at a slightly thinner and smaller measurement. The S25 seems fairly close to the S24; however, a device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">with more change</a> could be the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Early renderings showed off a device that was incredibly flat with the sides to go with it and rounded corners. The softer corners could help the handheld experience as older Ultra users will know about those sharp corners in their palms. Additionally, another rumor claims the Ultra model could sport a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-narrow-body-frame-rumors">narrower aspect ratio</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta introduced its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-rolling-out-a-restricted-version-of-its-app-for-teens">Instagram Teen Accounts</a> today. It&apos;s designed to control what your teenager can access while using Instagram and to limit who can contact them through their Instagram account. </p><p>It looks good to investors and concerned parent groups, but this is not how you fix anything because it&apos;s probably not going to work as well as we would like.</p>
<p>I think of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-new-kid-friendly-features">parental control software</a> the same way I think of the door lock on your house. They are there to make sure people who want to do the "right thing" will do it but don&apos;t deter anyone else. If I want to break into your house, no lock will stop me and if your kids want to do or see something on the internet you do not approve of, they will.</p><p>This sort of software isn&apos;t necessarily bad. A minor child has no say when it comes to rules about being online because mom or dad are 100% in charge of their well-being. And that kind of responsibility can be overwhelming for some parents. Relying on a software solution to act as a nanny can seem helpful, and for a lot of kids, it might work — mom or dad said no can be enough to do the "right" thing.</p>
<p>I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and say most kids aren&apos;t like this, based on my own experience as a kid. I&apos;m old enough that we didn&apos;t have Instagram or any sort of social media, but there were things we were pressured to do, just like peer pressure can make a kid today want to be all-in when it comes to being online. And yeah, a lot of the time, I did what I could get away with. Deterrents were only inconveniences.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5760px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="SX2nXLvwDtMDyfDaAy6rzA" name="Instagram-teen-accounts-notification.png" alt="Instagram teen accounts notifications" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SX2nXLvwDtMDyfDaAy6rzA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5760" height="3840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that&apos;s the real problem here — software is never going to stop your kids from doing what they want to do. As long as they have access to Google, they will be able to bypass any filtering software you&apos;ve set up. Kids are smart. Usually smarter than mom and dad when it comes to this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>In this case, it&apos;s even easier. There&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-two-factor-authentication-your-instagram-account">Instagram account</a> mom and dad can see, and then there&apos;s the other one a kid can make with a free email address. One is used to talk with family and friends from church, and the other is used to be yourself — or what you think you want yourself to be. Remember, the internet is forever, and what you do and say today will follow you throughout your life.</p><p>Instagram uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-ways-to-verify-age-on-instagram" target="_blank">age verification software</a> in a number of countries, but something like this could be bypassed by pointing to a free VPN to say you live in an eastern European country like Croatia. Like everything else, software can&apos;t stop anyone who is determined.</p><p>Meta could solve this if they wanted to. One Instagram account per device means the only account a kid can have is the one mom and dad approve of — unless a kid has a secret phone for their secret Instagram, of course. Even trying to use the web browser could be redirected to only open the app. If Meta really cared, it would do this.</p>
<p>Things like this pop up all the time; companies have to try and build controls into their software because the world has things parents don&apos;t approve of. I get it and agree. There are some things out there a kid should simply not engage with.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying companies shouldn&apos;t build things like this, but let&apos;s not pretend it&apos;s going to be a perfect solution. Maybe a better way to handle it is to talk with your kids. Let them know they will see and hear a bunch of crazy while they are online, and help them make the right decision themselves. Just because you&apos;re a parent doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t also be a friend.</p><p>I&apos;m not about to tell you how to raise your children. I will tell you that any parental control you set up is easy to bypass because your kids are smarter than you give them credit for. That includes the Instagram Teen Experience.</p>

<p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">launched the Moto Tag</a> at the tail end of June 2024, and sales went live about a month ago. I put it to the test as soon as I got my hands on the Bluetooth tracker, which was about one and a half weeks ago.</p><p>I have tested literally all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">best Bluetooth trackers</a> available to buy today, so I just <em>had</em> to test the Moto Tag. I&apos;m not going to lie though, it was pretty underwhelming at first. The most interesting part of a Bluetooth tracker, beyond its ability to track, is the extra bits. Motorola didn&apos;t advertise anything that I hadn&apos;t already seen in other trackers, so I was worried.</p><p>Every other tracker from Tile, Pebblebee, Samsung, and Chipolo can track your stuff when within range. They all cost roughly the same, priced between $20 to $30. The key factors that differ are the battery replaceability, the Bluetooth range, the IP rating, the loudness of the ringer, the form factor, and, of course, support for Android and iOS. The Moto Tag gets a lot right, but unfortunately, it fails to innovate and isn&apos;t good enough to beat the best from Tile or Pebblebee. You&apos;ll understand why in a bit.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9kJKAnqJTJwNAtLdpbxgiH" name="Motorola-Moto-Tag-lifestyle-5.jpg" alt="Motorola Moto Tag" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9kJKAnqJTJwNAtLdpbxgiH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Moto Tag, it&apos;s all about the design at first glance. It is very stylish and comes in two colors: Starlight Blue and Sage Green. Unlike most other brands, you don&apos;t have black-and-white color variants to choose from. This circular disc is small and almost exactly the same size as the Apple AirTag, measuring 32mm x 32mm x 8mm, similar to the AirTag&apos;s 31.9mm x 31.9mm x 8mm dimensions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3718px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EcGQUecRH7N5yJNHo3CakB" name="Motorola-Moto-Tag-lifestyle-6.jpg" alt="Motorola Moto Tag" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EcGQUecRH7N5yJNHo3CakB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3718" height="2092" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something that&apos;s different and somewhat questionable about the Moto Tag is the lack of a keyring hole. I believe this was intentional because all Apple AirTag accessories, like keyring holders, fit the Moto Tag, which is a pretty significant benefit. Oddly enough, Motorola doesn&apos;t sell its own Tag holders, so you&apos;re forced to purchase third-party accessories made for the AirTag. That&apos;s already extra money you need to spend just to be able to use the tracker for most use cases. In contrast, competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tile-bluetooth-trackers-review">Tile Pro</a> and Pebblebee Clip come with a keyring hole.</p>

<p>Once you&apos;re done ogling the beautiful but impractically made Moto Tag, you can go ahead and set it up. I did this twice, once on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> and the second time on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> for testing purposes. Since the Tag is compatible with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">Google Find My Device network</a>, it sets up in a matter of seconds. What&apos;s not so breezy is the resetting process, something I never struggled with before on trackers from Tile, Chipolo, or Pebblebee.</p><p>The Moto Tag has a big button in the center. All trackers have this so you can locate your phone, as does the Moto Tag, or use extra features. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, this button can allow you to remotely click pictures on your camera app. But you can also use this button to factory reset the Tag. Unfortunately, the button on the Moto Tag is not very tactile, and it&apos;s very hard to press. The click isn&apos;t audible, and there&apos;s hardly any tactile feedback, so sometimes you can&apos;t even tell if the button was pressed or not.</p>

<p>Much like the Tile Pro, the Moto Tag has a replaceable CR2032 battery, which should last for about a year. The Pebblebee Clip has a USB-C port built-in, which is even more user-friendly and sustainable. Unlike the Pebblebee Clip&apos;s IPX6 waterproofing, the Moto Tag sports a robust IP67 water and dust-resistant rating, and you can customize the loudness of the ringer through the companion app. Unlike Tile or Chipolo, you can&apos;t change the ringtone itself, though.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">I have tested all the newest trackers from Chipolo, Tile, and Pebblebee</a>, so I can confidently say that the Moto Tag isn&apos;t the loudest tracker around. Chipolo and Tile dominate that arena. Both Pebblebee and Motorola&apos;s trackers sound roughly the same in terms of loudness.</p><p>As for the Bluetooth range, the Moto Tag has one of 100m, which is really good and better than the Tile Mate&apos;s 76m and Chipolo One&apos;s 60m ranges. The Pebblebee Clip beats everyone with its 152m range, with the Tile Pro coming in second with a 121m range. On top of that, phones with UWB (ultra-wide bandwidth) get even more precise location-finding features. This is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">Galaxy SmartTag</a>, but that only works with Samsung&apos;s UWB-compatible phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HxLNDVzg4tu5f8vLKnRnAH" name="Motorola-Moto-Tag-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="Motorola Moto Tag" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HxLNDVzg4tu5f8vLKnRnAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like most other Bluetooth trackers, the Moto Tag works with both Android and iOS. However, it does not work with Apple&apos;s Find My Device network. On the other hand, the Pebblebee Clip gives you two variants, one with the option to use Apple&apos;s network and the other with Google&apos;s networks. Meanwhile, Tile enables universal support for Android and iOS with its trackers but you don&apos;t get Google Find My Device support.</p><p>To summarize. the Moto Tag costs $29.99, which is roughly the same as every other decent Bluetooth tracker. While the Moto Tag offers one or two bonus features, these are limited to Motorola devices or phones with UWB. You only benefit if you have either one of those or you care about the additional dust resistance.</p><p>Motorola didn&apos;t really do anything new or different, so it&apos;s not good enough for anyone to want to choose it over more well-known players in the game. A very small segment of users will benefit from the Moto Tag&apos;s extra features. Everyone else will probably just get something from Tile or Pebblebee. And why shouldn&apos;t they?</p>

<p>The Moto Tag looks really nice, and it has all the usual run-of-the-mill features that other trackers do. However, the lack of novelty makes it hard for Motorola to stand out and differentiate as a Bluetooth tracker worth buying — for non-Motorola users at any rate.</p></p>
