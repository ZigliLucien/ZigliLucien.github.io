<p>When it comes to tablets and foldables, it&apos;s tough to argue against the idea that Samsung is offering the best experience. Samsung&apos;s "everything but the kitchen sink" approach is finally paying off in a big way now that we&apos;re out of the dark days of TouchWiz. And while the company continues to improve the software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> remains a key selling point for those who want a truly "all-in-one" device, which is why I think it should be the default on tablets.</p><p>DeX flies under the radar, as it&apos;s almost never mentioned whenever a new flagship device is unveiled. However, changes and improvements are regularly made in an effort to let you turn your device into a portable computer.</p><p>The most recent overhaul came with the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6</a>, which introduced the "New DeX" interface. Instead of being provided with a completely different Home Screen and interface, New DeX basically feels like a super-charged version of what you get out of the box on something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You might even have a hard time noticing that you're even using "New DeX."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When activated, your Home Screen remains the same, including your app layout and any widgets that you might have added. But, as soon as you open an app, you&apos;ll immediately notice something different. Instead of the app taking up your entire screen, as it did before, it opens up in an app window, like it would if you were using "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Classic DeX</a>."</p><p>This is great for those who want to open multiple apps at the same time without dealing with the annoyances of split-screen. You still have access to those capabilities, but essentially, you&apos;re given much more flexibility than the traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> experience. The taskbar also remains persistent, but even your notifications and Quick Settings toggles are available just by swiping down.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-desktop.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra on desk in DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>What I&apos;m hoping for is that Samsung will introduce this "New DeX" as the default interface on new tablets and maybe even foldables like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It combines the best of both worlds, giving us the ability to use widgets on the Home Screen while making it easy to open multiple apps in their own separate windows. Then, Samsung can ditch the "New" and "Classic" monikers while still giving us access to both.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think this is what&apos;s actually going to happen. Instead, I&apos;m of the mindset that Samsung is going to end up ditching the DeX that we&apos;ve all come to know and love over the years. The "New DeX" will just become "DeX," while the stock launcher experience will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re a fan of the "Classic DeX" interface, then you might be a bit concerned that it&apos;s going away. Thankfully, that&apos;s not the case, at least for the time being. Samsung makes it possible to switch from "New" to "Classic," but you&apos;ll have to do a little bit of digging.</p><p>This New DeX experience also doesn&apos;t replicate a desktop experience as well, especially if you connect your tablet to an external monitor. For one, the only display settings option is to choose between "Mirror tablet screen" or "Use screens separately." Even if you choose the latter, New DeX doesn&apos;t scale the display properly, meaning that you&apos;re often left with black bars on either side.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.43%;"><img id="i8t83qDwb7KzW4Xfc3ephK" name="samsung-classic-dex-settings-1.jpg" alt=""Classic DeX" Settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i8t83qDwb7KzW4Xfc3ephK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2960" height="1848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">"Classic DeX" Settings </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2212px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eULcxH8wHBQUFB4sTqvdpK" name="samsung-new-dex-settings.jpg" alt=""New DeX" Settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eULcxH8wHBQUFB4sTqvdpK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2212" height="1244" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">"New DeX" Settings </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>By in large, this just automatically enables the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/use-multi-window-mode-samsung-galaxy-tab-s8">Multi window for all apps</a>" feature that&apos;s already available in the Labs section of the Settings app. There are a few other minor differences, such as the taskbar being able to hold more than four recently used apps. But, it&apos;s not really something that I would describe as being part of the "DeX" experience.</p><p>You might be asking yourself, "Would Samsung actually ditch "Classic DeX?" Well, the answer is quite simple. Yes, because it likes to make money. Samsung already sells its own lineup of laptops, and if you buy a tablet that basically does the same thing as a laptop but has better battery life, it loses out on potential sales. This is especially true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a> with its 14.6-inch AMOLED display, and when paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">Book Cover Keyboard</a>, it is about as close as it gets to having an Android-powered Surface competitor.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Book 4 360</a> is probably the closest comparison to make, as it&apos;s a 2-in-1 laptop with a touchscreen display. Pricing starts at $1,099 for the Intel Core 5 model, paired with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. There&apos;s also the Core 7 variant, priced at $1,349, but that bumps the RAM up to 16GB and comes with either 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pcrz2V9WKUi8wPCqaJueMn" name="samsung-galaxy-book-4-series-press-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Book 4 series lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pcrz2V9WKUi8wPCqaJueMn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1392" height="783" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, on the other hand, starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage, maxing out with 1TB for $1,619. Then, you&apos;re looking at another $350 for the Book Cover Keyboard, so on the surface, the Book 4 360 is a better deal. But that&apos;s only part of the story, as the Book 4 360 falls short of the Tab S9 Ultra in a few ways.</p><p>For one, while the screen is larger, it&apos;s also limited to a 1080p resolution and is capped at a 60Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, the Tab S9 Ultra is equipped with a smaller display, making it better for portability, along with offering a better viewing and gaming experience thanks to the AMOLED panel and 120Hz refresh rate. Not to mention that the battery on your Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra will last for days, whereas the Book 4 360 <em>might</em> make it through a day, maybe two.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra might be expensive, but it's still a better value than some of Samsung's best laptops.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I wish I could tell you what the future holds and that Samsung will leave Classic DeX alone, aside from introducing new features. Sadly, I don&apos;t have a crystal ball and have no clue what Samsung&apos;s long-term plans are with New DeX.</p><p>But there&apos;s a reason why I barely ever recommend anything other than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a> to those who don&apos;t want an iPad. That&apos;s because the majority of Android tablets are a mixed bag of disappointment. Whether it&apos;s because they lack polish, aren&apos;t updated very often, or are just downright bad. Unless something dramatic happens, Galaxy Tabs will remain my go-to recommendation, even if "Classic DeX" is removed, but it will be much tougher.</p><p>Samsung, please don&apos;t ruin a good thing, even if your analytics show that DeX isn&apos;t used by the vast majority of the user base.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google Photos is an app that ships by default on every Android smartphone and is an excellent tool for viewing all your photos and videos in one place. However, searching for that specific photo can be daunting when you have amassed a huge library over the years, especially with many duplicate or similar-looking shots. Thankfully, the company released a new feature called Photo Stacks in November 2023 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, which helps you better organize all your duplicate pictures. </p><p>In case you haven&apos;t been using this feature already, we&apos;ll show you how to easily enable and manipulate your similar-looking photos using Photo Stacks in Google Photos, so that your library view is well organized. No matter if you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> or a really cheap one, this feature works for all. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-photo-stacks-in-google-photos-2">How to enable Photo Stacks in Google Photos</h2>
<p>1. Open the Google Photos app. </p><p>2. In between the highlight carousel and the last photo you took, you&apos;ll notice <strong>three vertical dots</strong> on the right side of the app. Tap it. </p><p>3. This will open a pop-up menu from below, where the first toggle item should say <strong>&apos;Stack similar photos&apos;</strong>. Simply enable this. </p><p>4. Close the menu and go back your gallery view where you have multiple photos taken within quick succession. You&apos;ll notice just one of those photos is now visible, with a little number and symbol in the top corner, letting you know how many photos are stacked. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.50%;"><img id="Xe8pKXFocHF9bcbHwzgagJ" name="Use-Photo-Stacks-Google-Photos-1.jpg" alt="Photo Stacks in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xe8pKXFocHF9bcbHwzgagJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="745" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Photo Stacks only works for photos that are backed up to the cloud. Learn how to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-photos">use Google Photos to backup your media</a>. It could also take some time to stack recently taken photos, so check back in some time to see if it&apos;s done. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-manipulate-photos-in-a-photo-stacks-xa0-2">How to manipulate photos in a Photo Stacks </h2>
<p>Now that you have similar photos grouped together, you can do all sorts of things like change the top pick, share selected photos from the stack or all of them, or simply keep one photo and delete the rest. </p><p>To view all the photos in a stack, simply <strong>tap the photo</strong> and you&apos;ll see thumbnails of the extra images in a carousel below. Tapping each thumbnail will show you a larger preview of that photo. </p><p>To view all the photos in a stack at once, simply tap the <strong>logo with the four squares</strong>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.50%;"><img id="N5DgrbBNMryxyHtMacakWn" name="Use-Photo-Stacks-Google-Photos-2.jpg" alt="Photo Stacks in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N5DgrbBNMryxyHtMacakWn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="745" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To <strong>change the Top pick</strong>, you can long-press the other photo in the stack and choose <strong>&apos;Set as top pick&apos; </strong>from the options below. Now, this will be the photo that shows up in your library view. </p><p>In the same menu, you&apos;ll see <strong>&apos;Remove from stack&apos;</strong> next to &apos;Set as top pick&apos;. This will simply move it out of the stack and show it as another photo in the gallery, but it won&apos;t delete it. </p><p>To delete a photo or several photos from the stack, you can either manually select all the photos and tap <strong>&apos;Delete from device&apos; </strong>from the bottom menu, or you can select just the photo you want to keep and choose the <strong>&apos;Keep 1, delete rest&apos;</strong> option in case there are many photos in the stack. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>A word of caution. Once you remove a photo from a stack or choose to unstack the entire group of photos, you get an <strong>Undo </strong>pop-up option for a few seconds. However, after this, there is no way to re-stack those photos. Even toggling the main Photo Stack option on and off won&apos;t help. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-share-photo-stacks-in-google-photos-xa0-2">How to share Photo Stacks in Google Photos </h2>
<p>1. You can share a single image or all the images from a stack pretty easily. </p><p>2. When you long-press a stack from the gallery view and tap share, you&apos;ll get an option for <strong>1 item </strong>or <strong>XX items </strong>(where XX is the number of photos in the stack). </p><p>3.

<p>Google Photos is an incredibly versatile app for organizing your media, and the best part is that it&apos;s free. As of May 15, 2024, the app is about to get even more powerful as Google announced that it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-expands-ai-editing-features">bringing all its AI editing tools for free</a> for everyone to use. This means you&apos;ll be able to use features like Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Portrait Light, and others, even if you don&apos;t have a Google One cloud subscription. </p><p>Photo Stacks is a terrific addition to Photos and something everyone should use. It makes your gallery view less cluttered, so you can find the photo you&apos;re searching for much quicker. </p>

<hr>
<p>Hot on the heels of a somewhat controversial Garmin Forerunner update in March, Garmin released a new beta update, version 19.09, on Wednesday to its five latest Forerunner watches. And one bug fix can&apos;t arrive in a stable update soon enough.</p><p>The first beta update since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> launch, v19.09 helps you find a lost smartphone during an activity by saving the GPS location where your phone and Garmin watch disconnected. At that point, you can use the Find My Phone feature to track it down via Bluetooth.</p><p>You also get a new Garmin Messenger app on your watch. Up until now, you could only check Messenger on your phone, high-end Fenix models, or InReach-compatible handhelds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">GPSMAP 67i</a>; with this update, you&apos;ll be able to check responses on your wrist and send quick preset replies on Android (iOS blocks this function).</p><p>While the Forerunner 165 doesn&apos;t support Jet Lag Adviser, the other four Forerunners, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>, will now get a Jet Lag glance to check your progress acclimating after a long flight. It should come in handy if you&apos;re a frequent world traveler for marathons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hbLFtkXT9bBgRsnwh52Azd" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-find-my-phone.jpeg" alt="The "Find My Phone" option in the Controls menu on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hbLFtkXT9bBgRsnwh52Azd.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update includes "various UI improvements and fixes," and one in particular that stands out "fixes persistent notification vibration for incoming calls." This obnoxious bug will cause your Garmin watch to continue buzzing your wrist after you&apos;ve declined a call on your phone for about 10 seconds. We&apos;re beyond ready for this to be fixed in a stable update.</p><p>One fix exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Forerunner 955</a> is a patch for the Lock on Road feature, which essentially makes your post-run map look more accurate than it really is by dragging your GPS line onto the nearest road. All of the Forerunners received a fix to prevent music control crashes. </p><p>One noticeably absent fix, however, is anything related to the heart rate tracking issues introduced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-update-1822-adds-great-features-but-introduces-heart-rate-issues">March 18.22 update</a>. Many users complained that this patch introduced issues with the wrist-based HR sensor data. With update 19.09, Garmin added "heart rate dynamic source switching to select the best heart rate data source (watch or chest HRM) to improve accuracy during running activities."</p><p>We never heard back from Garmin about these user complaints, but this update feels like a message in itself: If you&apos;re dealing with heart rate accuracy issues, try a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-heart-rate-monitor-straps-garmin-fitbit">heart rate monitor strap</a> with wrist-based data as a backup. Hopefully, a future update will properly address these issues.</p><p>Beyond what&apos;s listed in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/forerunner-965/f/announcements/366717/public-beta-version-19-09" target="_blank">Garmin Forum patch notes</a>, the Garmin Forerunner v19.09 update added haptic feedback as you scroll through menu options, something that&apos;s often found on mainstream smartwatches. If you want to test these features for yourself, you&apos;ll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=bVo5U5BV292BSr2gkZhY2A" target="_blank">sign up for the beta software</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The first Android 15 beta includes a new default wallet app option in the existing Default apps list.</li><li>Previously, alternatives to Google Wallet were permitted in the Google Play Store, and there was a Default payment app option buried in the Settings app. </li><li>Now, the new Default wallet app setting clearly covers more than just contactless payments, including digital car keys and store loyalty cards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google made the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">Android 15 beta</a> available to testers on April 11, following two Android 15 Developer Preview builds. There&apos;s still a lot to uncover, but one new change affects the way Android handles default payment and wallet apps.</p><p>After users update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, they&apos;ll see a fresh option in the <strong>Default apps</strong> list in settings. You can now pick a <strong>Default wallet app</strong>, which will be used for digital payments, car keys, store loyalty cards, and more.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/android-15-wallet-app/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> spotted the default wallet app choice in the Android 15 settings app after updating to the first beta. "Wallet apps can store your credit and loyalty cards, car keys, and other things to help with various forms of transactions," the setting&apos;s description explains. Most people will see two options, <strong>Google Wallet</strong> or <strong>None</strong>, but more will likely come soon. The <strong>Amex </strong>app will appear if you have it installed, and it looks like Amex is the only known third-party app to support being set as a default wallet app in Android 15.</p><p>When you choose a default wallet app, it will become the app that handles all NFC-related tasks. This includes payments and things like unlocking with digital keys or using store loyalty cards. The new setting effectively replaces the <strong>Default payment app</strong> option in prior versions of Android, which, for some reason, was <em>not</em> in the Default apps list. Instead, the outgoing default payment app selection was found under five menu pages: <strong>Settings </strong>><strong> Connected devices </strong>><strong> Connection preferences</strong> ><strong> NFC </strong>><strong> Contactless payments</strong> ><strong> Default payment app</strong>.</p><p>Interestingly enough, it may be tough to utilize this new functionality due to a potential bug affecting the first Android 15 beta. As shared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/3991?single" target="_blank">Google News Telegram</a>, the NFC settings page appears to be broken, and it is no longer showing any settings for toggling the feature on or off. This was confirmed by Android Central, which also noticed the blank NFC page in settings on two different devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.67%;"><img id="kFRARntnDZrgdqra8busED" name="Android-15-NFC.jpg" alt="A blank NFC page in the Settings app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFRARntnDZrgdqra8busED.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="276" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this page being nonfunctional, Android doesn&apos;t seem to know whether NFC is enabled or disabled. This means that NFC-enabled features spanning from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> to digital keys likely won&apos;t work in the first Android 15 beta. One Android Central staff member tried to make a purchase with their Pixel after the update, and the terminal would not recognize the phone. Hopefully, no one installed this pre-release version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> on their main phone because it might be tough for some to live without contactless payments. </p><p>The problem has notably been reported on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/333935943?pli=1">Issue tracker</a>.</p><p>However, there were a handful of great features and tools added to the Android 15 beta, such as improved app archiving, better security, and new accessibility software.</p>

<ul><li>Google has released the first beta for Android 15 that eligible Pixel device owners and developers can get in on.</li><li>Android 15's first beta helps with app experience on larger displays, app archiving updates, and more for those with braille displays.</li><li>The first beta marks Google's beta milestone for Android 15, and the company states it still plans to move into "platform stability" by June.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the first beta of Android 15 today (Apr. 11), and with it come a few important features enrolled testers should know about.</p><p>According to Google, the first Android 15 beta is arriving for the Pixel 5a up to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8</a> series devices. This also includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> and the Pixel Tablet. Android 15&apos;s first beta brings more awareness to how larger displays (foldable/tablets) experience apps. Google states it has enabled the software&apos;s edge-to-edge capabilities for apps by default.</p><p>This update primarily benefits developers as they no longer need to tell the app to enable such capabilities explicitly. Furthermore, those creating apps will find Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/insets#inset-handling">Material 3 composables</a> available for extra assistance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1091px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.40%;"><img id="kD6ZvpZurfzDQ4YDse9sdX" name="android-15-first-beta-edge-to-edge-apps-enabled-default.jpg" alt="Google has enabled edge-to-edge display capabilities for apps in Android 15 by default." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kD6ZvpZurfzDQ4YDse9sdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1091" height="539" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 15 is picking up additional support for app archiving. Google states the software&apos;s first beta displays OS-level support for archiving and unarchiving unused apps to benefit "all app stores." The OS will remove the chunkier API and cached files but leave behind a user&apos;s data.</p><p>Due to this, Google says users will see the app remain in their device&apos;s launcher alongside an icon highlighting its "archived" state.</p><p>The company continues its push for better security with Android 15, introducing "Key management" for E2EE (end-to-end encryption). The beta will offer such management at an OS level for the API for contact keys. In turn, this will let users easily manage and verify another user&apos;s contact information.</p><p>More inclusivity is inbound for Android 15 as the initial beta opens its testing doors on TalkBack&apos;s support for braille displays. The software is only compatible with braille displays using the HID standard over USB and secure Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Google states it plans to reach "platform stability" for its next major OS release by June. The company is right on schedule with its desired Android 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/overview#timeline">development timeline</a>. Users should expect betas in April and May before we eventually move into its stability phase. Those enrolled in the beta are encouraged to provide feedback as the process continues.</p><p>The company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second developer preview</a> of Android 15 landed near the end of March and was all about Google&apos;s upcoming satellite connectivity. The company is preparing to introduce satellite capabilities for users&apos; SMS/MMS and RCS chats when they&apos;re without a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. Additionally, Google stated that it will continue to tighten the reigns on user security to bolster its capabilities in Android 15.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram announces several new features users can expect to see on the platform.</li><li>Currently, all users globally have access to "Cutouts," which lets users turn their photos into usable stickers and videos into animated stickers.</li><li>Instagram is preparing to introduce "Notes Prompts" that encourage more interaction while exploring Notes on profiles.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Here&apos;s a bit of fun to end your week: Instagram is introducing a few new features that are preparing to arrive for all users for DMs and more.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, the platform states the three features users can expect are designed to breathe more personality into Stories, Reels, and Notes. The first of the features is "Cutouts," which lets users turn photos into their own unique stickers.</p><p>Instagram states users use these custom stickers in Reels and Stories and any stickers created from a video will be animated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:603px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.50%;"><img id="Da5rJsSWfygze7rmchDk3h" name="instagram-cutouts-creation-example.jpg" alt="Instagram now lets users turn their photos and videos into usable stickers for Reels and Stories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Da5rJsSWfygze7rmchDk3h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="603" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the social media platform allows users to grab "eligible photos you see on Instagram" and turn them into usable stickers.</p><p>The next update is arriving for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-new-collaborative-features-notes-group-profiles">Instagram&apos;s Notes</a>, which will bring "prompts" to the quirky "set your mood" feature in DMs. The company states it has started exploring a way for users to "add prompts" to Notes that will encourage more interaction between users, friends, and followers. Those who see the prompt attached to your Note will be able to respond to it.</p><p>Prompts will appear within a user&apos;s DM page and display the number of responses it&apos;s received so far. Upon tapping, a short menu will appear from the bottom of the UI showing every user&apos;s response to the prompt. Your profile icon will be placed in the top left corner of this small menu, which, when tapped, will throw you into the standard Notes UI for you to write your mood.</p><p>Similar to how Notes works currently, it looks like users will be able to fine-tune the prompt&apos;s sharing settings. Users will likely find the option to share their "Notes Prompt" with followers they follow back or with close friends only.</p>

<p>That&apos;s not all for Notes; as Instagram teases, it&apos;s working on a way to bring the short blurbs to profiles. The feature is "coming soon" and will let users display their Notes on their profile for 24 hours. A person&apos;s blurb will appear right above their profile photo like a thought bubble.</p><p>Instagram states that Cutouts are currently available globally to all users. However, those interested in the new Notes feature must wait as it is still "coming soon."</p>

<hr>
<p>Rakuten Kobo has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kobo.com/news/now-in-colour-bring-your-books-to-life-with-the-new-kobo-libra-colour-and-kobo-clara-colour-ereaders" target="_blank">introduced</a> its first color e-readers, the Kobo Libra Colour and Kobo Clara Colour, alongside the classic black and white Clara BW.</p><p>The Libra Colour and Clara Colour are stepping up the game in Kobo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">e-reader lineup</a>, building on the company&apos;s beloved e-readers, the Libra 2 and Clara 2E. These new devices ditch the old monochrome Carta 1200 screens in favor of E Ink&apos;s Kaledio 3 module.</p><p>E Ink&apos;s Kaleido 3 screen technology boasts crisp 300ppi resolution in grayscale mode. But when you switch to color, that resolution dips to 150ppi. Still, E Ink promises a palette of 4,096 colors with richer saturation, a step up from the previous-gen Kaleido Plus display.</p><p>To tackle the extra load, Kobo has beefed up the Libra Colour&apos;s processing power compared to the Libra 2. Plus, it has upgraded the battery, now packing a 2,050mAh capacity, putting it on par with other e-readers known for their long-lasting battery life, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review">Amazon Kindle Paperwhite</a>. </p><p>The Libra Colour rocks a spacious 7-inch display and a generous 32GB of storage, all wrapped in an ergonomic design for cozy reading sessions. It keeps the perks of the Libra 2, like its IPX8 waterproof build and physical page-flipping buttons. Plus, it&apos;s now compatible with the Kobo Stylus 2, but snagging one will set you back an extra $70 since it&apos;s sold separately.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="oLdXBr62ZTjkPmoZLU5JWk" name="Kobo-Libra-Colour.jpg" alt="Kobo Libra Colour in white on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oLdXBr62ZTjkPmoZLU5JWk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="820" height="461" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Kobo Libra Colour </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rakuten Kobo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flip side, the Clara Colour stands out more from the Kobo Clara 2E. It sticks with the trusty six-inch display and IPX8 waterproofing but ups the ante with 16GB of storage and a beefed-up processor.</p><p>Both models provide access to the Kobo.com bookstore and seamless integration with OverDrive for snagging library books. They&apos;re also Bluetooth-ready, so you can listen to Kobo Audiobooks wirelessly.</p><p>These devices pack ComfortLight Pro-tech, which dials down the blue light, making late-night reading sessions comfy and easy on the eyes.</p><p>Kobo is also revamping the black-and-white version of the Clara, now dubbed the Clara BW, to set it apart from its colorful counterpart. It&apos;s pretty much the same as the old Clara 2E but with a speedier dual-core processor borrowed from the color models.</p><p>The Kobo Libra Colour will retail for $220, while the Kobo Clara Colour will be priced at $150. If you&apos;re eyeing the monochrome display, the Kobo Clara BW comes in at a lower price of $130. They&apos;re set to launch on April 30, and you can already pre-order them straight from Kobo&apos;s website.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung announces that more language support will arrive for its Galaxy AI software and features soon.</p><p>According to a press release, Samsung is preparing to expand the number of languages (and dialects) Galaxy AI supports this spring. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> already supports 13 languages, but Samsung states Arabic, Indonesian, and Russian will soon be options for users who are more comfortable with those languages.</p><p>Additionally, the Korean OEM plans to incorporate Australian English, Cantonese, and Canadian French into Galaxy AI&apos;s dialect side.</p><p>While not given an exact date, Samsung is interested in further widening its service by supporting Romanian, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, traditional Chinese, and European Portuguese. The company states users should see these languages enter the fold "later this year."</p><p>In a follow-up newsroom post, Samsung&apos;s president and head of mobile, TM Roh, said the company is "committed to democratizing mobile AI for all; Galaxy AI’s language expansion this year will allow even more Galaxy users to communicate beyond language barriers on a scale that is completely unique to Samsung."</p><p>However, what&apos;s curious is Samsung&apos;s apparent teaser about additional devices that receive Galaxy AI features. After reiterating devices that currently have some, the company added that there are "more coming soon."</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series were among the eligible devices for the update.</p><p>These phones and tablets also received Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>," which lets users run a web search for anything, anywhere on their phone.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s light teaser of Galaxy AI on even more devices makes sense, as the Galaxy S22 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">could be on that list</a>. The company&apos;s TM Roh spoke briefly about it, stating the brand is conducting a "review" of the series to see if Galaxy AI features could function properly on the S22 series. The glaring issue is how heavily reliant Galaxy AI is on a device&apos;s hardware.</p><p>Despite that, Roh seemed somewhat confident it could be done—but we&apos;ll have to see. As for what else could join it—the waiting game continues!</p>

<p>Plankton isn&apos;t the only menace befalling the residents of Bikini Bottom! A new foul algae beast has taken over and needs to be cleaned up immediately in the first paid DLC for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-are-chores-more-fun-in-vr">PowerWash Simulator VR</a>, available now on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/3713270985434472">Meta Quest store</a> for $7.99.</p><p>Players will have the chance to use new PowerWash tools to clean up six different environments, including Conch Street, The Bikini Bottom Bus, The Krusty Krab, The Patty Wagon, The Invisible Boatmobile, and The Mermalair. As is the case with the base game, you can join friends to help make the clean-up easier and more of a social experience.</p><p>The SpongeBob SquarePants paid DLC follows the game&apos;s previous free DLC, The Muckingham Files 1 & 2, which added six brand new missions and bonus missions to visit previous client locations with new jobs.</p>

The studio head says the developer still has full autonomy over its titles and will continue to support and develop games like the PowerWash Simulator series for "years to come."</p><p>While PowerWash Simulator VR had some technical issues on launch, FuturLab has patched them out and upgraded the visuals for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> players. Since then, gamers have been praising the game&apos;s zen-like gameplay and immersion, which lets them relax and decompress alongside friends in the multiplayer mode while earning achievements along the way.</p>
