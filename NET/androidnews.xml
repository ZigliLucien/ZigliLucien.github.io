                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ 
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>X is revamping the block feature, allowing blocked users to see public content.</li><li>The update aims to fix a loophole that let users bypass blocks with alternate accounts, allowing them to still view and interact with content.</li><li>Blocked users won’t be able to engage but can still lurk, leaving many feeling uneasy about potential harassment.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>X (formerly Twitter) is overhauling how the block feature works, with Elon Musk confirming that all public content will be viewable, even if you&apos;ve blocked someone, which could totally change how privacy and interactions work on the platform.</p><p>Independent app researcher Nima Owji was the first to spill the news about X/Twitter&apos;s upcoming block feature update. Musk later corroborated it, saying it’s been a long time coming.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">High time this happened. The block function will block that account from engaging with, but not block seeing, public post.<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1838285460440862861">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>An insider at X told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24252438/x-blocked-users-view-public-posts" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that the upcoming block feature update is aimed at closing a loophole where users could bypass blocks by switching to another account. This flaw let people still view and interact with content from accounts that had blocked them.</p><p>The news about X&apos;s block feature change has sparked a lot of buzz and speculation. Some think it’s a move to ensure everyone still sees ads, while others worry it could make handling harassment on the platform even harder.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With respect, I think this is a bad idea. There are many reasons somebody may not want certain individuals from easily seeing all their public posts. There are some REALLY bad actors on social media, sadly.<a href="https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1838334316520312989">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>That&apos;s because while blocked users on the platform can’t engage with your posts, they’ll still get to lurk and watch. Unsurprisingly, people aren’t thrilled and are already saying this could just make harassment easier.</p><p>So far, X hasn’t fully ditched the block feature, but it keeps changing how it works. In May, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/XEng/status/1786144517521097013" target="_blank">revealed</a> that if someone you’ve blocked replies to your post, you’ll still be able to see that reply. X said this change was essential to keep the block feature in line with its goal of being an open platform.</p><p>Musk hasn’t held back on his dislike for the block feature. Last year, he tweeted that blocking people “makes no sense” and suggested muting instead. Then, in August, he even hinted that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/elon-musk-announces-block-feature-removal">the block option might be getting the axe altogether</a>.</p><p>By backtracking on its earlier promise to completely scrap the block feature and instead allowing it to still limit engagement, X is trying to play it safe. This shift aims to cut down on the stalking and harassment that would probably explode if it just got rid of blocking entirely.</p>

<p>With the iPhone 16 Pro, you get a great phone that measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.3mm and weighs 199g. It has a glass front and rear but a titanium frame that is more durable than the Pixel&apos;s aluminum build.</p><p>The latest iPhone&apos;s bezels are thinner, making it easier to use with one hand. Apple states that this model&apos;s Ceramic Shield display is 50% tougher, which gives your iPhone the drop protection you look for in a phone. The iPhone 16 Pro is available in White, Black, Natural, and Desert Titanium.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro&apos;s camera layout is bigger than the Pixel, with two cameras stacked on top and a third on the side. This year&apos;s iPhone is also waterproof and dustproof with an IP68 rating, meaning it can withstand submersion in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes without damaging it.</p><p>On the other hand, the Google Pixel 9 Pro has a weaker aluminum frame but a fancy design that&apos;s just as nice to look at as the iPhone&apos;s. The Pixel is flat all around, and the new island-style visor on the back of the camera gives it a futuristic look. The latest Pixel dimensions are 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm, and it weighs the same as the iPhone 16 Pro at 199g.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro has a glass front with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for additional protection. The phone matches the iPhone&apos;s robust IP68 rating, so it can withstand submersion in 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes and remain unharmed. The Pixel 9 Pro is available in Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, and Obsidian.</p>

<p>Apple gave the iPhone 16 Pro a 6.3-inch LTPO Super Retina display with a maximum brightness of 2,000 nits. The iPhone also offers Dolby Vision, a 1,206 x 2,622 display, and a 460ppi pixel density. There is not much difference in display specs compared to previous models, but Apple made it possible for users to dim the iPhone&apos;s display to one nit this time, which is very useful in dark environments.</p><p>The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, an Always-On mode, and ProMotion technology. The phone also has fantastic touch response, and thanks to HDR10, you get great colors and contrast.</p><p>With the Google Pixel 9 Pro, you get a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED display with a snappy 120Hz refresh. The Pixel one-ups the iPhone 16 Pro with HDR10+ over Apple&apos;s HDR10. The display has a 1280 x 2856 resolution and a 495ppi pixel density, which gives the Pixel a sharper image than the iPhone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro has a higher peak brightness than the iPhone, going up to 3,000 nits. This makes it easier to look at your phone outdoors. As always, the Always-On display lets you see the time, notifications, and more even when the screen is locked.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro has fantastic specs to flaunt, with a powerful A18 Pro chipset and 8GB of RAM. You can choose from different storage options, such as 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. Its 48MP wide, 12MP telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide cameras can take great pictures that you can later share on social media without any compression. However, the iPhone&apos;s 12MP selfie camera loses out against the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>You can use the iPhone 16 Pro&apos;s Camera Control option to get direct access to the camera and snap a photo with an additional button press. You can also zoom in and out by sliding your finger back and forth on the button. The iPhone 16 Pro supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 25W and Qi2 wireless charging up to 15W. While it falls short in battery size with a 3,582mAh cell, you can make it last by using features such as Low Power Mode.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro has a bigger 4,700mAh battery and faster charging speeds. It delivers 27W wired, 21W wireless, and 5W reverse wireless charging. The Tensor G4 processor does not match the iPhone&apos;s chipset but still provides a great user experience and AI-heavy features. Happily, Google has finally resolved the heating issues that have tormented the Tensor-powered phones. With the latest Pixel, you can choose from 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options, matching the iPhone&apos;s options. You also get double the RAM with the Pixel, toppling the iPhone&apos;s 8GB RAM with a whopping 16GB RAM instead.</p><p>Camera quality is where the Pixel always shines, and the 9 Pro&apos;s 50MP wide, 48MP telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide cameras can take fantastic pictures. Like the iPhone, you can record in 4K, but you get a vastly better 42MP selfie camera.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll see a huge difference in software in the iPhone 16 Pro versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro. Naturally, the iPhone runs iOS whereas the Pixel runs Android out of the box. Google has its own style, as does Apple, and you can choose the one that&apos;s more appealing based on your personal preferences.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro launched with iOS 18 on which you can dramatically customize the lock screen, home screen, and Control Center. You can change the lock screen&apos;s fonts, colors, and more to give it a personal touch. iOS 18 also has RCS support, making it easier to message your Android friends. The latest iPhone, featuring Apple Intelligence, has new creative capabilities. For example, Camera Control gives you faster access to visual intelligence and lets you easily interact with the advanced camera system. You can expect between five to seven years of software updates, based on Apple&apos;s support history.</p><p>There are tons of software goodies you can enjoy, but to mention one more, you have access to Writing Tools where you can adjust emails or notes to be more concise and friendly and give them a more professional tone. In Phone and Notes apps, you can also transcribe, record, and summarize audio. If you&apos;ve used a Pixel before, a lot of this might sound very familiar. That&apos;s because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18 stole a lot of features from Android</a>.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro comes with Android 14 out of the box, and Google promises seven years of software updates. The latest Pixel also has new AI features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google" target="_blank">Add Me</a>, that are exclusive to the Pixel 9 series.

<p>As you can see in the iPhone 16 Pro vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro showdown, both have phones much to offer. Which one you choose comes down to what features matter most to you. The iPhone 16 Pro has a more powerful chipset, but the Pixel 9 Pro has a better selfie cam and superior AI features, among other things. You won&apos;t get all the features promised on the iPhone from day one, which is something else to consider. Both phones start at $999 for the 128GB variant, so the price isn&apos;t a tiebreaker.</p><p>Some users may like Apple&apos;s style, while others might prefer Google&apos;s layout and the flexibility of Android. You may find more app options on the Play Store than Apple App Store. Choose depending on how comfortable you are with either OS, iOS or Android, and the advantages or disadvantages that each ecosystem brings.</p>

<p>I had been fiddling with the idea of replacing my Android TV with a projector for a while before I bit the bullet. It was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/if-i-buy-only-one-thing-this-prime-day-it-will-be-this">one thing I wanted to buy last Prime Day</a> because I felt it would be the perfect substitute for a smart TV.</p><p>Of course, a projector cannot get as bright and crisp as a real television set, so you might be curious about my conviction to go forth with this plan. My bedroom is insanely small. There are boxes full of stuff everywhere, and I cannot even fit a full-blown wardrobe or a proper dressing table in there.</p><p>Thus, putting a TV in such a small room was out of the question. But at one point, streaming my favorite shows before bedtime on my smartphone just wasn&apos;t cutting it. I toyed with the idea of a wall-mounted screen, but that would further shrink my already tiny bedroom.</p>

<p>There are other limitations of a projector as well. It needs to be mounted on a mount or a stand; most of them need to be plugged in to function, and cheap ones don&apos;t come with Google TV or Android TV.</p><p>The first two issues were significant for my small room conundrum. I had to configure the room&apos;s furniture arrangement and determine whether such a setup would be less untidy and occupy less space as opposed to a regular old wall-mounted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV</a>.</p><p>After considering everything, I decided to get the XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro for my experiment. XGIMI provided a sample to help me test this idea. This affordable little projector has a built-in stand that swivels at an angle. As for the height-adjustable stand, I got a cheap off-brand one online.</p>

<p>Had I bought the projector with my own money, the entire setup would still have cost me almost exactly $500. That&apos;s filthy cheap, especially considering that the MoGo 3 Pro can project screen sizes as big as <strong>120 inches</strong>! That&apos;s big enough to cover a significant portion of my bedroom wall.</p><p>To make the most of the experience, I decided to place the projector right next to my bed, sandwiched between my bedside table and the bed. Conveniently, there&apos;s an electrical socket in that vicinity where I have my multiport USB-C charger plugged in. The swiveling design of the MoGo 3 Pro really came in handy here because I didn&apos;t need to twist and turn or readjust the stand itself once it was planted in its spot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="moVZWbgN2y2we44bEZKHCa" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-android-tv-replacement-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/moVZWbgN2y2we44bEZKHCa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro has auto keystone correction with a dedicated button for this on the remote control. The remote itself is like any other smart Android TV remote; you can use Google Assistant to look up stuff and use the Netflix, YouTube, or Amazon Prime buttons to quickly open those apps. And what&apos;s even cooler is there&apos;s an extra unlabeled shortcut button that is completely customizable. I have mine set to Disney Plus, but you can choose any app you like.</p><p>The picture quality is really good too, delivering a 1080p resolution. The brightness is improved with this iteration, going from 400 lumens on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">MoGo 2 Pro</a> to 450 lumens on the MoGo 3 Pro. It&apos;s not a major improvement, but it is certainly noticeable. Overall, I felt satisfied with the image output. It&apos;s ideal for nighttime streaming and binge watching my favorite anime series.</p>

<p>I cannot express how quick and easy it was to have the whole thing up and running. Since I have tested the last-gen MoGo 2 Pro, I felt a markedly improved experience with the auto keystone correction. It is so easy and you don&apos;t have to be a tech expert to set it up.</p><p>I&apos;d probably struggle to get the angle right with any other projector because of the awkward lack of space in my room. During this experiment, I had flashbacks of the Anker Nebula projector that I reviewed a few years back. It was a nightmare to get the keystone right on it in tight spaces and small rooms.</p><p>The circular lens and swiveling stand make a world of difference. In the end, I concluded my experiment was a glowing success. I am now spoiled with a 120-inch screen plastered adjacent to my bed at a perfect viewing angle. Sometimes, I&apos;ll cast some Reels on the gigantic screen, just because. The XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector truly replaced my need for an Android TV, and there&apos;s no going back now.</p><p>So, if you don&apos;t have space in your flat or room, give this hack a try!</p>

They analyze your fitness level and help you improve your pace (speed) or endurance (how long you can run) over time by suggesting workouts.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> comes with six months of Fitbit Premium, you can use this run coaching to improve, then save and update your favorite workouts if you decide not to keep the subscription. Plus, you have other tools like Cardio Load and Daily Readiness that, while not specific to running, will still help you improve.</p><p>Here&apos;s everything you need to know about run coaching on the Pixel Watch 3!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-google-pixel-watch-3-run-coaching-2">How to enable Google Pixel Watch 3 run coaching</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SHciSG6pzyGTQp6VnYhaMg" name="fitbit-running-coach-setup.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing how to set up Fitbit Premium run coaching." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SHciSG6pzyGTQp6VnYhaMg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, you need Fitbit Premium to access Pixel Watch 3 run coaching. You should be offered a six-month free trial during the initial Watch 3 setup process unless you already have an active subscription. With Premium enabled, this feature should only take a minute to set up.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Fitbit app</strong>, then the <strong>Coach tab</strong>.</p><p>2. You should see a banner that reads "Get personalized workouts tailored to your readiness, goals, and recent workouts." Tap <strong>Get started</strong>. If you don&apos;t see this banner, look for the <strong>Today&apos;s run</strong> section.</p><p>3. Choose whether you&apos;re a <strong>Beginner</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, or <strong>Advanced </strong>runner. Intermediate runners can regularly run at least 3.1 miles or 5 kilometers. Advanced runners either "run competitively" or "follow a specific running plan." Since that&apos;s a bit vague, I&apos;d suggest anyone who regularly runs 10Ks or half marathons would be advanced by Google&apos;s metric.</p><p>4. Choose whether you want your AI coaching to focus on improving <strong>pace</strong>, <strong>endurance</strong>, or a <strong>balanced</strong> approach (aka both).</p><p>You&apos;ll now have daily AI recommendations sent to you! If you end up reconsidering your choices, go to the Coach tab and tap <strong>See all</strong> next to <strong>Today&apos;s run</strong>, then the <strong>top-right ellipsis</strong> and <strong>update preferences</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HjgvAmutoj6D2tSogkeKYg" name="fitbit-running-coach-generated-workout.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing auto-generated workouts and the option to edit them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HjgvAmutoj6D2tSogkeKYg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once Pixel Watch 3 run coaching is enabled, you&apos;ll see a daily run in the Coach view. Specifically, you&apos;ll see <em>four</em> run options, typically an easy run, tempo run, tempo intervals, or sprint intervals in our early testing. Although Fitbit will highlight one top rec, you can choose another if you&apos;d prefer something harder or easier.</p><p>Tap on any workout, and Fitbit will summarize why this run will benefit your training; plus, once you&apos;ve started running consistently, it&apos;ll begin incorporating data on your recent runs to explain why you should do this workout next. For example, it might tell you that you&apos;ve done plenty of moderate-zone runs, so a tempo run will improve endurance at a higher heart rate.</p><p>Your quickest option is to tap <strong>Start on watch</strong>; within seconds, the workout will appear on your wrist, so you must simply wait until the GPS connects and tap the <strong>Start button</strong>. It&apos;s a temporary workout that won&apos;t be saved to your workouts list.</p><p>However, you may also want to tap <strong>Customize run</strong>, which creates an individualized copy that <em>does</em> save to your permanent workouts. You can tap on any interval to change the duration, heart rate zone, or even the goal itself to something else like Distance or Calories burned. You can also delete or rearrange the intervals, and then create your own from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="other-running-tools-on-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Other running tools on the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-and-Android-statue.jpeg" alt="An Android statue wearing a headband and a dummy Pixel Watch 3, standing behind a display of Pixel Watch 3s." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI run coaching is exclusive to Fitbit Premium. You can even find some run-themed audio guides among the workouts. But other Fitbit tools for the Pixel Watch 3 will benefit runners <em>and</em> won&apos;t cost anything extra.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a> tracks your overall workout load from runs, cross-training, and everyday activities that elevate your heart rate, and then tells you if you&apos;re working out more or less than in previous weeks.</p><p>During my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3 review</a>, I tested out Cardio Load and found that it "puts more stock on a workout&apos;s length than its intensity," giving more training load than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> for a long hike but less for an intense anaerobic track workout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW" name="google-pixel-watch-3-readiness-score.jpg" alt="Morning Brief Readiness Score on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, if you sleep wearing your Pixel Watch 3 for at least a week, you&apos;ll start receiving Daily Readiness scores that judge your sleep quality, resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and recent workouts and score your readiness to tackle future workouts from 1–100.</p><p>With both Cardio Load and Daily Readiness, Fitbit extrapolates your Target Load, or the amount of activity you should aim to hit based on your readiness and past Cardio Load scores. Your AI-recommended runs will be tailored to hit your Target Load, but if you&apos;re not subscribed to Premium, you can look at past workout loads and then create your own workout to try and hit that score.</p>

<hr>
<p>Marshall is rolling out a new set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> today called the Monitor III. These headphones are hitting store shelves in various regions, including the U.S., and they follow up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/marshall-monitor-ii-anc-review">Monitor II ANC headphones</a> that debuted last February.</p><p>The Monitor III headphones keep the same design vibe as their predecessor, featuring a sleek leather finish, a foldable design, and the iconic ANC button or control knob.</p>

<p>Marshall says the Monitor III will greatly extend playtime with ANC on, offering up to 70 hours and 100 hours without it. For comparison, the previous model provided up to 30 hours with ANC and 45 hours without.</p><p>The Monitor III&apos;s Active Noise Cancellation is also getting a nifty upgrade. They’ll now constantly monitor ambient noise to keep unwanted sounds at bay. Plus, they feature a new adaptive loudness option that tweaks audio to fit the surrounding noise levels. Users can also take advantage of the Dynamic Loudness feature, letting them fine-tune the treble, mids, and bass at any volume.</p>
<p>Marshall is adding a Soundstage Spatial Audio feature to the Monitor III, which promises to give users a more immersive experience. The headphones also come with a customizable M-button, allowing users to tweak their EQ settings and control Spotify or their favorite voice assistant. </p><p>Further, these headphones are Bluetooth LE audio ready, which means they support Auracast, which has so much potential, according to Android Central Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">recently had a chance to test it out</a>. </p><p>The company notes that these advanced features help the Monitor III stand out from the competition, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/sony-wh-1000xm5-launch">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> and the most recent Apple AirPods Max. While those models provide up to 50 hours of playtime with ANC, Marshall claims the Monitor III already has the upper hand in that department.</p>

<p>For those curious about the Monitor III&apos;s technical aspects, it weighs around 250 grams and is equipped with 32mm drivers with 35Ω driver impedance and a frequency response ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. </p><p>While 70 hours is the promised playtime, the headphones take about two and a half hours to charge fully through USB Type-C. Also, alongside the foldable design, they come in a premium-looking hard case that is easy to carry around. </p><p>The Marshall Monitor III headphones will retail for $359 in the U.S., available on the company’s website and at various retail stores. In other regions, they’re priced at €349 in the EU and £299 in the UK.</p>

<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">testing quite a few open-ear earbuds</a>, I&apos;ll begin by making a case for why this is the Editor’s Choice by starting... with the case. While not the smallest earbud case on the market, it is one of the smaller cases when you look at offerings from the open-ear competition. Nothing again places its signature colored dots on the inside to make putting the earpieces in their cradles a cinch. The lid is clear with a metal hinge and another metal embellishment where the case opens. </p><p>Sitting inside, the buds and the entire package look almost like a jeweler’s display. Though thin and easily pocketable, the case is tall. Although it will fit in your pocket, depending on how tall you and your pockets are, it also might be sticking up and out of your pocket.</p>

<p>Being open-ear earbuds, they don’t sit inside your ear canal, and I’ve worn them for hours at a time to test their comfort. The result was no fatigue, to the point that you’d almost forget that you’re wearing earbuds. The soft-touch silicone material the ear hooks are made of, along with the position of the battery and angling of the transducer, combine like Voltron to form a giant robot that protects your wearing comfort. It&apos;s good that battery life holds up to my extended periods of wear and meets Nothing&apos;s claim of eight hours on a charge. You may get a little more juice if your listening volume is low the majority of your time wearing them.</p><p>Let’s get to what you came here for, though! Sound quality. I listened to various genres of music at low volumes and higher volumes. I listened in quiet rooms and on noisy urban streets. I listened to movies and anime. Nothing Ear (Open) are the closest I’ve come to experiencing an open design that sounds like traditional earbuds that sit in your ear canal. For the first time in an open-ear review, I can say that bass lovers will thoroughly enjoy this experience, but that is not to the exclusion of those who love acoustic music. The musicality and stereo imaging are just as enjoyable.</p><p>The haunting, ethereal vocals are beautifully reproduced when listening to “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” OST. The soundstage is diminished at low volumes, but turning the volume up increases that soundstage, adding the ethereal back to the experience.</p><p>Jazz is jumpin’ like your favorite juke joint! Ok, so you may not have a favorite “juke joint” in this day and age (Google it), but you have clarity, discreet instrumentation, warm upright bass reproduction, beautiful horn sections, and, ultimately, immersion.</p><p>Sylosis&apos;s “Poison for the Lost” is a counterpoint to The Roots “Do You Want More????” The former is a death metal track heavy on guitar and with guttural vocals. The latter is a bass-heavy hip-hop track with some high-frequency instrumentation, thanks to the addition of bagpipes in the mix. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oTjqR5UTgWBUdD7o7jiGLY" name="nothing-ear-open-bud-x-app-advanced-eq.JPG" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTjqR5UTgWBUdD7o7jiGLY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For low-volume listening, you’re likely going to want two different EQ settings, and that’s another area where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">many of Nothing’s audio offerings shine</a>. With the Ear (open), you get Nothing’s full slate of EQ offerings between their simple and advanced EQ settings. </p><p>The simple settings, complete with the ability to customize what is essentially a 3-band EQ, will be enough for most listeners, especially considering these are open earbuds. But if you feel like it makes a difference, you can hit Nothing’s proper parametric EQ in the advanced tab and play with gain, bandwidth, and Q-factor to your heart’s content. I’d recommend playing with the simple settings at the very least because it will make a difference in sound quality at low volumes when listening to podcasts or anything vocal-focused.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the Ear (open) that I appreciate is the ChatGPT integration. The first earbuds to do so. It’s great, and it’s incredibly useful when researching things on the go or talking through a plan or idea, but it’s not perfect. A brief example of the good, the bad, and the ugly is this:</p><p>To test it out, I queried ChatGPT about the best fancy restaurants in Malibu, California, to eat at. This beautiful city is on the famous Pacific Coast Highway that runs along the Southern California coastline. ChatGPT gave me brilliant advice, along with context on why, for a few different restaurants, but that’s where the utility ends. I couldn’t ask it to call the restaurants for me or to give me driving directions tied into Google Maps and then take me there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yk9aP6Df6zHu28Cc5p7ugV" name="nothing-ear-open-case-red-dot.JPG" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yk9aP6Df6zHu28Cc5p7ugV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A little feature that some folk may not consider rounds out the list of things I like. The case, like the buds themselves, is IP54-rated for dust and water ingress. Since these are meant for use cases where people may be outside during inclement weather, that’s a reassuring feature. However, this rating means that you can’t wear them during heavy rains, so in the next iteration, I’d like to see an IP65 rating, which would allow these to be worn during more challenging climate conditions.</p>

<p>One last note on the things I like: call quality is <em><strong>very good. </strong></em>I recorded microphone audio when I had them connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> and asked callers how I sounded during calls. In both instances, audio quality was Nothing to sneeze at.</p>

<p>There isn’t a lot to dislike here! At all. A couple of standout items would be the lack of wireless charging for the case and the case length. Both issues are pretty standard in the open-ear market segment, though.</p><p>With that said, while there isn’t much I dislike, there are two things I’d like to see in a second-generation version of these fantastic earbuds: wireless charging for the case and Hi-Res Wireless audio support. Not necessarily to make the music “better,” but since they <em>are</em> open-ear, having every bit of dynamic range I can get so that I can get every ounce of audio data and frequency out of these earbuds as possible would be great!</p><p>I’d also like to see Google Assistant integration. Once I research restaurants while I’m out with my beautiful wife and we decide on one, I need to hand it off to Google Assistant for whatever next steps: creating a note, driving directions, setting a reminder, you get the idea.</p>

<p>Last, though the ChatGPT integration is awesome, I need that functionality to do more. For example, I’d like the ability to configure each earbud independently to use whatever digital assistant you want. Currently, you can only set Google Assistant or ChatGPT as your assistant. Once you set the pinch command on either earbud, that setting is ubiquitous across both earbuds, despite the fact that you can customize the other functions independently for either earbud.</p><p>And I’m being nitpicky here, but I’d like them in a color other than white so that they won’t look grimy as quickly as these may. Time will tell, but with white buds and a white case, this is a concern of mine.</p>

<p>There are a few others in this market segment, but they have a lot to live up to because, at $150, Nothing makes an excellent value proposition with its quality and feature set. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open</a> and BeyerDynamic Verio 200 both compete on sound quality and features, but they are at a premium. The former costs twice as much, $300, while the latter is $70 more at $220.</p><p>You can get close to the Nothing Ear (open) in price with Shokz OpenFit and 1More Fit products, but I think the Ear (Open) has them beat in sound quality and options. </p>

<p>Sometimes, in life, it feels like Nothing is simple. That won’t be the case here! The Nothing Ear (Open) compete with products that cost much more and sound just as good. </p><p>The earbuds sound great and are feature-rich, including the ability to converse with an AI assistant if you also have a Nothing phone. These alone make the Ear (Open) very easy to recommend for those hunting for a solid pair of open earbuds.</p>

<hr>
<p>Redmi has confirmed the Redmi Note 14 Pro series will launch on September 26 in China, with both models in the lineup promising flagship-level screen toughness and durability.</p><p>The Xiaomi sub-brand announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3021514657/OyhXZuXQx" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the Redmi Note 14 Pro and Pro Plus will come with Gorilla Glass Victus 2, a solid upgrade over the Victus glass on last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_14_pro_series_launch_date_officially_announced-news-64648.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is crafted to endure drops from heights of up to one meter on concrete. Additionally, it matches the original Victus by surviving falls from as high as two meters onto asphalt.</p><p>As an extra perk, customers will get a complimentary screen replacement if their device suffers any damage within the first twelve months.</p><p>On top of that, the Redmi Note 14 Pro series is said to have aced the IP69 waterproofing test. This rating shows that the device can endure high-pressure hot water jets, going beyond the immersion capabilities defined by the IP68 standard.</p><p>In contrast, the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus had an IP68 rating, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-long-term-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro</a> came with an IP54 rating.</p><p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro series will join a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phones</a> with an IP69 rating, such as the upcoming OPPO F27 Pro and the recently released Pro Plus model, which also boasts Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><p>Official renders shared by Xiaomi reveal the Redmi Note 14 Pro in Mirror Porcelain White, Phantom Blue, and Twilight Purple. The device boasts a curved display with a hole-punch cutout, along with an elliptical camera island that houses three lenses and an LED flash.</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1838090984560988531" target="_blank">suggest</a> that the Redmi Note 14 Pro models will sport a 1.5K OLED display and a triple camera setup, headlined by a 50MP primary sensor. Additionally, the Note 14 Pro is expected to pack a 5,500mAh battery with support for fast 67W charging.</p><p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro is tipped to draw its power from a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, while the Pro Plus may be equipped with a Dimensity 7350 SoC.</p><p>The Chinese phone maker often rolls out global versions of the Redmi Note series a few months after the initial launch in its home turf. Therefore, don’t expect these phones to become available in your region right after their debut this week.</p>

<p><em><strong>Romit asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Hi Jerry,</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I have a question related to recycling old phones where I live. This place does not have a e-waste recycling system as far as I know. Could you maybe suggest how I can get rid of my old phones?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Romit! I love this question because I think the most important thing we should talk about when dealing with tech products is properly reusing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-recycle-your-old-android-phone">whatever materials can be recycled</a>. These gadgets we love are filled with easily recycled materials, and if they end up buried in a landfill, that can&apos;t happen. Recycling not only helps keep costs in check, but it also helps leave the world in as good shape as possible for our kids and their kids.</p><p>The quick answer for anyone who doesn&apos;t feel like reading further is that any legitimate business that sells phones should know where to drop old ones off for recycling or be willing to take them from you for proper recycling. If all else fails, that&apos;s usually a great option.</p>
<p>This really showcases the one problem with the internet when it comes to gathering information — what applies to <em>me</em> may not be the case where <em>you</em> are. Many of the websites Google will index for a search about e-waste recycling are written by people who have easy access to a dedicated recycling program, either municipal or private. </p><p>That&apos;s not always the case and I know it&apos;s not because I don&apos;t have access to either option myself. I live in a rural area of the U.S. and I have no government-issued recycle boxes or centers for e-waste and private recycle-for-cash companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ecoatm.com/">ecoATM</a> don&apos;t have any boxes of kiosks anywhere near me. There is a recycling center, but it only takes plastic bottles and aluminum cans because it&apos;s for typical household waste.</p>
<p>I can (and do) recycle my old electronics, though. Here in the U.S., we call them "big box stores," and businesses like Best Buy, Lowe&apos;s, and Home Depot will accept e-waste and actually recycle it rather than just throw it in the dumpster.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="kk7y52Qo7PKsmoBtgrWW9K" name="AT&T-logo.jpg" alt="AT&T logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kk7y52Qo7PKsmoBtgrWW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might have similar stores in your area, and they may also partner with a recycling company that handles e-waste. It&apos;s worth asking if you don&apos;t notice a kiosk or bin near the front of the store.</p>
<p>Finally, and this should apply regardless of where you live, most stores that sell phones know how to recycle an old one even if they don&apos;t offer the service themselves. Here in the United States, any AT&T or Verizon store will take your old phones or tablets and make sure they are properly recycled. In Canada, Rogers will do the same.</p><p>In your area, you probably don&apos;t have an AT&T or Rogers phone store, but there&apos;s a good chance you have a large shop that deals with consumer electronics. They should be able to help you do the right thing and recycle your old gear.</p>
<p>Finally, one last thing to mention is never to send an old phone or tablet off for recycling without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-factory-reset-android-phone">erasing all of your data</a> from it. It&apos;s very difficult to extract data or sign in to an account on Android or iOS without knowing the correct password for the device, but it is possible. You probably aren&apos;t a celebrity or politician with people thirsting to read your private data, but you still have bank passwords and other financial information, as well as photos and other data that&apos;s pretty personal tied to your accounts. Be safe, and factory reset your device before it leaves your house.</p>

<ul><li>A set of alleged renderings for the Galaxy Tab S10's keyboard accessories have surfaced.</li><li>The images suggest the "Galaxy AI key" will pop into a slot between the right side Alt key and the D-Pad.</li><li>Samsung may also slightly tweak its keys by offering a separate row of function keys above the row of numbers.</li><li>The Galaxy Tab S10 series is rumored to drop in October alongside the rumored Galaxy S24 FE.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A batch of alleged Galaxy Tab S10 accessory renderings gives us an idea about Samsung&apos;s "Galaxy AI key."</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-official-images-of-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-covers/">YTECHB</a> reportedly obtained a batch of alleged renderings for the covers designed for the Galaxy Tab S10 series. A highlight of the rumors is evidence of a "Galaxy AI key" for the extra keyboard option. The images suggest the key will be nestled between the Alt Gr key and the D-Pad on the right side of the accessory.</p><p>Its design is fairly similar to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI icons, which all sport a multi-starred flair. The positioning of the key remains the same across the keyboard accessory with and without a trackpad.</p><p>Another noticeable difference is the keys on the keyboard. It seems Samsung will provide a separate row of keys for F1, F2, etc. Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-cases">with the Tab S9 series</a>, the keys were merged with the top row of climbing numbers.</p><p>Speaking of, the trackpad included variant looks thin as it offers a decent amount of space around the pad to rest your hand. There appears to be a hard-plastic raised portion with a clip for the Galaxy Tab S10 to rest upon. This isn&apos;t surprising as it&apos;s likely there for trackpad functionality. Leaked renderings of the non-trackpad version don&apos;t show such a pronounced pedestal for the Tab S10 to rest on.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung is seemingly continuing its offer of a Book Cover that can double as a kickstand. This should make it easy for users to quickly prop up their device to respond to a few emails before hitting the road again.</p><p>Images of the back of both rumored Cover accessories show cutouts for the dual camera array and a raised portion to accommodate the S Pen. The publication claims Samsung will offer the "Book Cover" and "Book Cover Slim" styles in black and white colorways.</p>

<p>Rumors started spreading about a supposed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-galaxy-ai-key-keyboard-rumor">Galaxy AI Key</a>" earlier this month. Early speculation claimed the button would offer a shortcut to Galaxy AI feature, but which tools users could find are still unknown. The existence of this for the Galaxy Tab S10&apos;s keyboard accessories was supposedly "confirmed" by a Samsung insider.</p><p>Once the tablets arrive, we&apos;ll have to see if this opens a Galaxy AI menu or, perhaps, a selection of our favorite tools.</p><p>Elsewhere, a major Galaxy Tab S10 leak might&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-specs-galaxy-ai-leak">exposed everything about the device</a> before launch. The Tab S10 Ultra is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display while the smaller Tab S10 Plus could see a 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen. Both are suspected to deliver a 2X "anti-reflection" atop the displays with thinner bezels.</p><p>Speculation about a large amount of Galaxy AI seems accurate, especially following a feature leak: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">Transcription</a>. Rumors add the tablet duo may debut with Circle to Search, Note Assist, Drawing Assist, Photo Assist, Interpreter, Live Translate, and Chat Assist.</p><p>On the flip side, it&apos;s hard to imagine Samsung offering the Tab S10 duo <em>with </em>a keyboard accessory. The Tab S9 Ultra arrived with a striking $1,200 price tag, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/imagine-paying-1200-dollars-for-tablet-without-keyboard">but without a keyboard included</a>, it seemed like a hard pill to swallow. Regardless, the Galaxy Tab S10 duo is rumored to pick up an October release date alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-video-and-pricing-leak">rumored Galaxy S24 FE</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Following an early preview of OxygenOS 15 (Android 15), a report claims OnePlus is moving toward an Apple-like future.</li><li>The software is seemingly adopting much of what iOS provides like volume slider animations, "Live Photos," and a Control Center rework.</li><li>Dynamic Island is also returning, which was a feature many Android fans weren't too impressed with, but Android OEMs copied it anyway.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is busy toiling away at OxygenOS 15, but recent rumors claim the company is heavily invested in an Apple-like design.</p><p>Following a supposed in-depth look at OxygenOS 15 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oxygenos-15-is-getting-an-ios-makeover/">SmartPrix</a>, the software will reportedly deliver a major rework to its Control Center. The early preview showed that OnePlus will implement a 2x2 media player, a simple brightness slider, and a 1x2 volume panel. The Control Center is also seemingly split into two areas to give users a clear separation between it and notifications.</p><p>The publication states that in OxygenOS 15, "swiping down from the left" will produce your collection of notifications. The company is also testing customization for the Center, letting users choose which tools are there (icons) and hide text.</p><p>With so much going on, the post states OnePlus added an option for users to revert the design to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-android-14-hands-on">OxygenOS 14</a> days, instead.</p><p>The rumors continue, stating that the OnePlus Dynamic Island variant will likely return for its Android 15 skin. Apparently, instead of sitting off-center at the top of your display, the new OxygenOS 15 version will sit directly in the center, encompassing the selfie camera.</p>

<p>The Apple similarities continue as the publication states the software may deliver "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/live-photos">Live Photos</a>." According to our sister site friends at iMore, Live Photos lets users on iPhone capture a 1.5-second clip of the photo they just captured. The video is stored on an iPhone (or Cloud) as a 15fps .MOV file in conjunction with your standard JPG.</p><p>The volume slider/panel is potentially receiving an animation change like iOS. The publication claims it will shrink (narrow) if pressed again. Additionally, OnePlus is reportedly working on new customization options for the lock screen. The preview showed options to create a 3D lock screen alongside tools to alter the size/position of the clock.</p><p>OnePlus is supposedly eyeing a late September or early October date for its OxygenOS 15 (Android 15) beta enrollment period.</p><p>Despite OnePlus&apos; seeming interest in shifting toward a more Apple-esque design, the Dynamic Island idea was arguably one of the most notable two years ago.
