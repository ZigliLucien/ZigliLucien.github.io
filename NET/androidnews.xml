<p>Google Messages users are reportedly getting random gibberish texts that contain strings of characters and seem to show up as encrypted content.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> provides default end-to-end encryption, ensuring only the intended recipient can read the messages. However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/s7drbq/received_an_encrypted_text_message/?sort=new" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-messages-spam-encrypted-rcs-messages/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> shows that people are receiving RCS messages that look like spam.</p><p>These messages mostly look like gibberish, with random letters and numbers in no particular order. They likely appear this way because they couldn&apos;t be properly encrypted.</p>

<p>The original post in the thread is from two years ago, but it&apos;s recently gained a lot of new replies. According to these recent responses, many users are getting messages from outside their area code. That said, our own Derrek Lee confirms he received a similar gibberish message, but it came from within his own area code.</p><p>All the messages include the same legitimate link to Google’s support page on troubleshooting issues with decrypting encrypted messages.</p><p>For those who might not know, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-rcs-chat-features-google-messages">Google Messages uses Rich Communication Services</a> (RCS). It&apos;s a safer texting method than SMS and MMS. Plus, RCS offers end-to-end encryption for extra privacy.</p><p>Something seems to have gone wrong because users are now getting spam-like messages. To clear things up, there&apos;s a difference between the original issue in that thread and what&apos;s happening now. The original post was about a user who got a message from a contact that couldn&apos;t be decrypted. When the contact resent it, everything worked fine.</p><p>This time, the messages are coming from unknown senders, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be an isolated case. The texts are arriving from various countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, Cameroon, Tanzania, and more, according to the report.</p><p>At the moment, there&apos;s not much information on where these posts are coming from, but Android Police believes it might be a rogue spambot. The outlet says this spambot is trying to find and collect active numbers through read receipts, and the gibberish messages we&apos;re seeing might be a glitch.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung reportedly began working on a more powerful and efficient SoC, likely to be called Exynos 2600.</li><li>The chipset is under development with the codename “Thetis,” based on a figure from Greek mythology.</li><li>It will power the Galaxy S26 series, and Samsung plans to take the lead by launching the 2nm chip as soon as possible.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last year, Samsung shared plans to mass-produce its 2nm and 1.4nm process-based chipsets at its Foundry Forum event. Now, if a South Korean-based publication is to be believed, the company may have already started work on its next major chip as it aims to keep up with the competition.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20240522000285">ETNews</a>, Samsung Electronics has already started the development of a 2nm chipset as competition with Apple and TSMC heats up. At the Foundry Farm last year, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">said</a> it would mass-produce the 2nm process for mobile applications in 2025. The process is claimed to showcase a 12% increase in performance, a 25% increase in power efficiency, and a 5% decrease in total area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vHYCbaUqzvdBPkM8dBpqL4" name="exynos-generic.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos processor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHYCbaUqzvdBPkM8dBpqL4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Per the latest report, Samsung began the 2nm AP (application processor) project codenamed “Thetis,” which is believed to be the Exynos 2600 — the flagship chipset likely to debut with the Galaxy S26 series in 2026. </p><p>Assuming all goes well with testing, Samsung will reportedly be one of the first to bring the commercialized 2nm-based chip, following a likely 3nm chip arriving with the Galaxy S25 next year. It also means Samsung will compete against the Apple iPhone 17 series, which will likely be released next year with a 2nm-based chip.</p><p>This could also give Samsung a leg up in the race against TSMC as Qualcomm looks for a foundry that can produce a future Snapdragon chip. The report notes that Samsung intends to take the lead on 2nm chip production by launching its flagship chip as early as possible.</p>
<p>Samsung also opts for Snapdragon chips on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship devices</a> in some regions like the U.S. and Canada. However, the Exynos 2600 will probably be available in other regions globally as Samsung hopes to boost its in-house chips. </p>

<p>Your body&apos;s blood oxygen levels serve as a warning sign of sleep apnea, trouble adjusting to high altitudes, or even serious pulmonary medical conditions. Finger-based pulse oximeters are the most accurate for spot readings, but uncomfortable for sleep tracking. And you won&apos;t know if you need one unless you do some long-term monitoring first. That&apos;s where smartwatches with SpO2 tracking come in.</p><p>Blood oxygen monitoring is increasingly common on smartwatches these days. But not all pulse oximetry sensors are created equal, and many watches are limited on when (or how often) you can take readings. Continuous SpO2 tracking is rare to find, and burns through battery life quickly. And of course, Apple Watch owners will need to look elsewhere, due to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-ban-saga-takes-another-turn-as-itc-hits-back-one-legal-expert-claims-masimo-clearly-abusing-patents">legal issues with SpO2 readings</a>.</p><p>Starting with the Garmin Forerunner 265, we&apos;ve rounded up some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> with blood oxygen monitoring. We&apos;ll focus on the best options related to battery life, frequency of readings, related health-tracking features, accuracy, and more.</p>

<p>Garmin watches, generally speaking, are your best option for testing blood oxygen data. While some watches only offer SpO2 spot checks or data during sleep, Garmin is the rare brand to offer an all-day mode, measuring every 5–15 minutes and targeting moments when it detects a lack of motion. During runs, when the results would be unreliable, it takes fewer readings. </p><p>Nearly any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> could claim this spot, since most have Pulse Ox readings and all-day mode. So why choose the Venu 3? It&apos;s one of the rare few to offer an ECG tool for AFib detection and skin temperature data during sleep data, as well as the usual accurate heart rate & heart rate variability (HRV) data. If you care about SpO2, you probably want as much other health data as possible. </p><p>In addition, the Garmin Venu 3 has the brand&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-announced">Sleep Coach</a> for judging your sleep quality, the enhanced Body Battery tool that detects what&apos;s draining your energy, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-garmin-watches-feature-jet-lag-adviser">Jet Lag Adviser</a> to judge your recovery during travel. It&apos;s missing Garmin&apos;s acclimation mode — which we&apos;ll explain with our next pick — but it&apos;s otherwise on the cutting edge for Garmin software.</p><p>More generally, our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-can-measure-blood-oxygen-saturation-levels#section-how-to-choose">Garmin Venu 3 review</a> runs through its many positives compared to other Garmin watches, from its bright AMOLED display and more stylish design to its built-in mic and speaker for Bluetooth calls and voice assistant commands. You can even stream Spotify playlists. It&apos;s not as smart as your typical smartwatch, but it&apos;s as close as a fitness watch will get you. </p>

<p>Garmin watches tend to be expensive, so we chose the Venu 3 as the best smartwatch for blood oxygen data in part because it&apos;s "only" $450. If you can spare a little more, however, the Garmin Forerunner 965 is a better SpO2 option in three key respects. </p><p>First, the Forerunner 965 lasts 23 days in standard use. All-day SpO2 mode will significantly cut into that number, but you&apos;ll have more leeway than the 14-day Venu 3 will give you. If you only need spot checks or sleeping data, that might be less of a concern.</p><p>Second, only the Forerunner 965 has Garmin&apos;s Altitude Acclimation mode. When you&apos;re above 800 meters, it&apos;ll take averages of your blood oxygen, respiration rate, and resting heart rate to see how well you adapt to higher altitudes over three weeks. Serious athletes from climbers to marathoners could benefit from this tool.</p><p>Third, the Forerunner 965 has other cutting-edge fitness features for runners and cyclists. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Our Garmin Forerunner 965 reviewer</a> gushed over tools like training readiness, training load status, real-time stamina, and other metrics that helped him improve as a runner. </p><p>Aside from the high price, the downside to choosing the Forerunner 965, is that its last-gen Elevate v4 sensor lacks ECG spot readings and skin temperature data. Your choice may depend on whether you feel you need that information or not. </p>

<p>If you care about blood oxygen data, then you&apos;re <em>probably</em> also interested in other bodily health data, too. Most smartwatches track heart rate and SpO2, but if you need more information, then the Fitbit Sense 2 is an excellent choice to consider — if you don&apos;t mind paying for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a>.</p><p>We&apos;ll note upfront that the Fitbit Sense 2 can&apos;t take SpO2 spot checks. That might be a dealbreaker for you! We&apos;re still including it because its SpO2 app automatically sends this data to the Fitbit app overnight. Long-term graphical data during sleep is arguably more useful than random spot-checks for people suffering from sleep apnea. Plus, you can export that data to your doctor from the app — something competing brands don&apos;t offer.</p><p>In addition, the Fitbit Sense 2 can catch irregular heart rhythm, both actively with the ECG and passively with the HR sensor. The latter also captures HRV data to determine overnight energy recovery. The Sense 2&apos;s continuous electrodermal sensor (cEDA) can detect your current stress levels, and your temperature sensor tests the quality of your sleep at night.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2 reviewer</a> praised the watch for its redesign compared to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-sense-review">Fitbit Sense</a>. It&apos;s narrower, more comfortable, has a physical button to select things instead of an annoying capacitive touch button that you had to squeeze and didn&apos;t always work, and uses a revamped UI that we liked. Plus, you have the benefit of Google&apos;s Fitbit acquisition in that it gets access to Google Maps and Google Wallet, something that regular fitness watches can&apos;t usually access.</p><p>You may also want to consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, which offers the same SpO2 tech and a similar battery life for half the price of the Sense 2. We only chose the Sense 2 over it because the Charge 6 technically is a fitness <em>tracker</em>, not a smartwatch.</p>

<p>Hands down, Samsung makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, with the Galaxy Watch 6 as our current favorite. Aside from loving the One UI 5 Watch interface, we really appreciate how Samsung stays at the cutting edge of health tracking.</p><p>With the Galaxy Watch 6, you can spot-check SpO2 data using the relevant Tile, or measure during sleep. There&apos;s no continuous SpO2 data, which would burn through the Watch 6 battery fairly quickly, but the first two blood oxygen options should suffice for many.</p><p>In addition to SpO2 data, Samsung also measures your heart rhythm, body composition, and skin temperature, and it&apos;s received FDA approval for passive AFib detection. Plus, it&apos;s been medically cleared for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">sleep apnea detection</a> in the second half of 2024, which is one of the main reasons people track SpO2 data. </p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">our Galaxy Watch 6 review</a>, we did have occasional issues with deflated blood oxygen data at night, particularly on the heavy Classic. The smaller Galaxy Watch 6 is more likely to be comfortable for sleep data and adhere to your wrist more naturally. </p><p>While the Galaxy Watch 6&apos;s 40-hour battery is well below what Garmin or Fitbit provide, many people care more about getting apps, Google Assistant, and other smarts that a typical fitness watch could never offer. So we&apos;ve included it here as a more balanced pick compared to the other specialized entries. </p>

<p>Most smartwatches have Pulse Ox these days, but you can never be fully sure how accurate the readings are. While most smartwatches ask for FDA approval for the accuracy of their heart rate monitors, they don&apos;t do the same for their SpO2 sensors because they&apos;re much more difficult to get right. In fact, as far as we know, only one smartwatch has SpO2 tracking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K201456" target="_blank">FDA approval</a>: the Withings ScanWatch.</p><p>This isn&apos;t your traditional smartwatch with proper apps, but that ensures it can last 30 days per charge with automatic 24/7 heart rate monitoring. It has "clinically validated oxygen saturation" readings — taken at the UCSF Hypoxia Research Laboratory in San Francisco — that were "validated against the gold standard which involved blood oxygen samples analysis." In other words, you can trust that its SpO2 data is as medically accurate as a smartwatch can deliver.</p><p>The Withings ScanWatch combines this SpO2 data with HRM, breathing, and movement data for some of the best sleep tracking data and sleep apnea detection you can get from a device that isn&apos;t medical-grade. It can also detect AFib and offers some standard workout tracking, though not quite at the level of a Garmin or Fitbit.</p><p>Withings has since announced the ScanWatch 2, which added respiratory rate, overnight HRV, and 24/7 temperature tracking. Withings apparently didn&apos;t get clinical approval for SpO2 with this model, calling it a "wellness feature," but we assume it uses the same technology, so perhaps it&apos;s equally accurate. We can&apos;t be sure, so we&apos;re keeping the first-gen watch as our pick for now. </p>

<h2 id="why-do-you-need-a-fitness-smartwatch-with-blood-oxygen-monitoring-2">Why do you need a fitness smartwatch with blood oxygen monitoring?</h2>
<p>Hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen levels in your blood, is a serious condition caused by a variety of possible ailments. And without a pulse oximeter, you may not know that it&apos;s low blood oxygen that&apos;s causing the problem.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17727-hypoxemia" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a>, symptoms can include headaches, shortness of breath, tachycardia, coughing, and (in extreme cases) bluish skin. Plus, of course, sleep apnea can cause other symptoms like poor and sweaty sleep, depression, and an inability to regain energy.</p><p>One common reason for low SpO2 scores at night is sleep apnea. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-sleep-apnea" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a> says that about 30 million people in the U.S. suffer from it, but only 6 million have a diagnosis for it. It goes unnoticed for many, hurting their sleep quality without them ever realizing it. But a smartwatch can detect these symptoms. </p>
<h2 id="which-garmin-watch-is-best-for-blood-oxygen-monitoring-2">Which Garmin watch is best for blood oxygen monitoring?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7C6zYLbiAGVRR7ZweyWwzV" name="Garmin-Instinct-2-Solar-Pulse-Ox.jpeg" alt="Pulse ox rating of 96% and heart rate on Garmin Instinct 2 Solar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7C6zYLbiAGVRR7ZweyWwzV.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Almost every Garmin watch supports all-day SpO2 data, aside from a few older models. You may want to choose based on longest battery life, but long-lasting watches also tend to be bulkier, which could make sleep tracking less comfortable. It&apos;s about finding the right balance. </p><p>Athletes who need Garmin&apos;s altitude acclimation widget will typically find it on Garmin&apos;s priciest watches like the Fenix or Epix watches. For something a little more affordable, you could choose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">2 Solar</a>, or any of the Forerunner 9X5 models. </p><p>If you&apos;re more generally looking for sleep quality data, the Venu 3 is a good option because of its solid battery life, Sleep Coach, and skin temperature data. But it&apos;s on the expensive side; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> will save you $200, lasts 11 days, and has a couple more running tools that you&apos;ll appreciate. Not a bad trade-off!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>Blood oxygen monitoring has become so commonplace in advanced smartwatches that you almost assume it&apos;ll be there. But beyond the physical presence of the sensor, it&apos;s just as important how the Pulse Ox actually works on your watch and how the software makes use of the data.</p><p>Both Fitbit and Garmin generally take a similar approach, silently collecting blood oxygen data and giving you a score or average of how well you&apos;re actually sleeping. The difference is that you can manually take a SpO2 reading on the Garmin Forerunner 265 whenever you want, while Fitbits mostly run behind the scenes. Either way, they&apos;ll give you a general sense if you&apos;re having trouble getting enough oxygen while sleeping, and their large batteries ensure running the Pulse Ox won&apos;t require daily charges.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch and Pixel Watch support nightly SpO2 readings as well, if you want a more traditional smartwatch experience. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Ultra 2</a> <em>used</em> to track SpO2 data before having to disable it for legal reasons, so iPhone owners will have to look elsewhere until Apple finds a more legally appropriate replacement. </p><p>You may also want to consider smart rings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>. They typically measure SpO2 data passively at night, with a much more comfortable sleeping experience than you&apos;d get with a smartwatch. </p>

<ul><li>A Samsung contract given to repair shops has leaked and paints a sour picture as user data is reportedly involved.</li><li>Shops are seemingly required to upload a host of user data to Samsung's database when they come in for repair.</li><li>Samsung also requires repair shops to "disassemble" a user's device if it's discovered that they've used a third-party part.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information has surfaced regarding a leaked contract that reportedly details Samsung&apos;s requirement that repair shops divulge sensitive user information.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/samsung-requires-independent-repair-shops-to-share-customer-data-snitch-on-people-who-use-aftermarket-parts-leaked-contract-shows/">404Media</a> have reportedly obtained a Samsung contract to repair shops and have allegedly "confirmed" its validity. In its terms, shops must upload information "daily" about consumers who come in for repairs. The contract shows that Samsung requires shops to inform them about a consumer&apos;s name, contact information, phone identifier (IMEI number), and the details of their visit.</p><p>All of this supposedly goes into a Samsung database known as "G-SPN." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/samsung/2024/5/23/24163372/samsung-repair-snitch-aftermarket-parts">The Verge</a> states it has also seen information like this before in 2023.</p><p>The publication contacted Aaron Perzanowski, a law expert from the University of Michigan, about the matter. Perzanowski stated that "most consumers would be very surprised to learn that their personal information and details about their devices are being shared with the manufacturer," adding that "this looks like a substantial and unexpected invasion of consumer privacy."</p><p>The leak also shows that shops working with Samsung are required to "immediately disassemble" devices that may have been fixed previously with aftermarket parts. A portion of the agreement states that after disassembling, repair shops are to inform Samsung of the "details and circumstances" of the parts they&apos;ve discovered.</p>

<p>Under the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, consumers have the right to utilize third-party parts to repair their devices if necessary. This was confirmed by legal director John Bergmayer, according to 404Media.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung about the contract&apos;s details but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>This all comes to light following iFixit&apos;s announcement that it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">cutting ties with Samsung</a> due to its misaligned goals in device repairability.

<p>YouTube Music is starting to roll out a feature on Android that lets users utilize their voice to search for songs they can&apos;t get out of their heads.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/24/youtube-music-song-search-android/">9to5Google</a>, users should begin noticing a wavelength icon beside the microphone symbol when tapping search in YouTube Music (to the far right of the search bar). As of update 7.02, tapping the wavelength symbol produces a colorful page that prompts users to "play, hum, or sing" a tune to run an AI-backed search through the platform. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.94%;"><img id="ZFhReK4c8Xqu7uHxFmxNAM" name="YouTube-Music-song-identification.jpg" alt="New button to identify a song in YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFhReK4c8Xqu7uHxFmxNAM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="399" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> gets a match, users are given a simple splash page with all the information about the song. The "results" page shows a song&apos;s album cover, title, group (or artist), and the album&apos;s title with its debut year. Moreover, users can play the song right there or save it to a new or pre-existing playlist.</p><p>YouTube Music&apos;s new song identification can continue as the platform offers the same wavelength symbol at the bottom. Its reappearance lets users restart the search process instead of backing out into the app&apos;s search page.</p><p>The publication adds that users can also download the song, which is likely an option tucked into the three-dot menu.</p>

<p>While the new song identification has been spotted in version 7.02 of YouTube Music, the feature is reportedly activated via a server-side update. In the meantime, users should ensure they&apos;re running the latest app version. Despite running software version 7.02.51 we haven&apos;t noticed the feature yet.</p><p>Users will be familiar with the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">humming to search</a> for a song as the Google app has had it for a few years now. You&apos;re able to hum, sing, or even whistle, and Search will try and match the melody to the correct song. Similarly, a type of song identification hit Pixels a few months ago, letting the device keep its ears open to songs. Through "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a>," Pixel phones can identify what song is playing if enabled and can notify the user so they&apos;re not dreading it later.</p><p>In other news, YouTube Music&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">Gemini extension</a> finally arrived for Android and desktop users yesterday (May 23). After connecting their YouTube Music account, users can begin asking the AI to find specific songs made by an artist they&apos;re familiar with. Asking Gemini to "play" a song works on Android, however, it&apos;s not functioning properly on the web yet.</p>

<hr>
<p>In a surprise move, Spotify announced Thursday, May 23, that it would completely drop support for the Car Thing later this year, bricking every device sold. Car Thing was Spotify&apos;s first hardware product, announced in early 2021. It served as an intermediary between your smartphone and your car, specifically targeted at cars that didn&apos;t have Android Auto or Apple CarPlay Support. The tiny touchscreen device was marketed as a simpler and safer way to play Spotify tunes while driving. </p><p>When the Car Thing debuted, the general consensus was that it was a neat idea without a clear purpose. In fact, in our own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-car-thing-review">Car Thing review</a>, we came to the same conclusion. It had a quality design, simple UI, and voice control — but was it really necessary as more and more cars started shipping with proprietary infotainment systems, Android Auto support, and Apple CarPlay capabilities?</p><p>Spotify seemingly came to the same conclusion. The company made the Car Thing widely available in February 2022 and stopped making new ones five months later. Now, as of Dec. 9, 2024, Spotify is killing support for Car Thing entirely. That doesn&apos;t just mean it won&apos;t provide Car Thing software updates or aftersale support. It&apos;s actively bricking every hardware device it ever sold. Car Things will work perfectly fine on Dec. 8 and will become E-waste by Dec. 10. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZwzkcUB9sHLG9aKgpoMmpb" name="Spotify-Car-Thing-presets.jpg" alt="Wider view of Spotify Car Thing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZwzkcUB9sHLG9aKgpoMmpb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every device will eventually reach end-of-life status, so Spotify dropping support for Car Thing isn&apos;t egregious on its own. However, products and accessories that depend on server-side support to function are in a whole different category and should follow a separate set of rules. When you buy something like Car Thing, which depends on Spotify&apos;s service to provide any value, there is an expectation that the service will be upheld for a reasonable amount of time. </p><p>Spotify stopped making Car Things in late July 2022 and sold existing stock for a period of time thereafter. Let&apos;s say you bought a Car Thing in July 2022. In that scenario, Car Thing will only have been supported for about 17 months. Now is a good time to also point out that this <em>thing</em> sold for $90. Again, Spotify isn&apos;t just ending software support or customer service for Car Thing; it is rendering the device completely useless. </p><p>That&apos;s the gamble that comes with buying hardware products that cannot function without support from a company. In these situations, one could argue there is an implied agreement between buyer and seller that support will be offered for some time. </p>

<p>Spotify dropping support for Car Thing is different than, say, Apple dropping iOS support for an iPad. The oldest internet-connected device I own is the first-generation iPad, which was released in 2010 and received its last iOS update (5.1.1) in 2012. Not every internet and server-supported feature works on that iPad; in fact, many of them don&apos;t work at all. But I can still use the iPad, access all my apps and games, and even connect to the internet. The equivalent to Spotify&apos;s decision would have been if Apple just told me to throw away my iPad in 2012.</p><p>In fact, Spotify says in its announcement that it recommends "safely disposing of your device following local electronic waste guidelines."</p><p>The egregious part of Spotify&apos;s choice to brick Car Things is that these devices don&apos;t require any additional upkeep on the company&apos;s end. Car Thing is a tethered device that needs a smartphone to function and connects to the Spotify app on your phone. There isn&apos;t public knowledge of any Car Thing feature or service that requires additional server support or infrastructure to function beyond those that everyone uses when they connect with any Spotify client. In other words, I can&apos;t think of a practical reason that Spotify is killing Car Thing other than because it can. </p><p>Spotify&apos;s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/" target="_blank">support document</a> and the email it sent to users seem to support my version of the events. The email starts with a single sentence: "We&apos;re switching gears." Spotify wants to put the Car Thing behind it and will brick devices to that end. </p><p>"We have made the decision to discontinue Car Thing. This means that Car Thing will no longer be operational," Spotify explained in a support document. "This decision wasn&apos;t made lightly, and we want to assure you that our commitment to providing a superior listening experience remains unchanged."</p>

<p>At first, I thought I was the only one disgusted by Spotify&apos;s treatment of the Car Thing. My reaction was, in part, because I think the Car Thing was a really cool concept that could&apos;ve taken off. However, I was surprised to find that there is a small but passionate cohort of Car Thing users who are just as disappointed by Spotify&apos;s actions. In posts on social media, some pointed out their dissatisfaction with the lack of refunds offered by Spotify for their Car Thing purchase. </p>

<h2 id="does-the-spotify-car-thing-have-a-place-in-2024-2">Does the Spotify Car Thing have a place in 2024</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QD5pKjCjbrfoNVTUawvPvb" name="Spotify-Car-Thing-air-vent.jpg" alt="Air vent details on Spotify Car Thing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QD5pKjCjbrfoNVTUawvPvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth wondering whether Car Thing had a place in 2024, at a time when most cars are equipped with some sort of built-in infotainment system. I happen to think that Car Thing did have a reason to exist since there are plenty of older cars without support for media control. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/android-for-cars-bringing-more-apps-to-cars.html#:~:text=With%20over%20200%20million%20cars,apps%20to%20cars%20is%20now." target="_blank">says</a> that there are over 200 million cars on the road with Android Auto, and that sounds like a lot until you realize there are just shy of 1.5 billion cars on the road worldwide, according to 2024 numbers from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2021/06/how-many-cars-are-there-in-the-world/" target="_blank">Hedges & Company</a>. </p><p>But it really doesn&apos;t matter whether Car Thing needed to exist because Spotify already stopped making the hardware. This only concerns the software. As we mentioned earlier, there isn&apos;t a clear reason Spotify needs to discontinue software support for Car Thing. Regardless of whether Car Thing was a good idea or not, the bottom line is simple: Spotify sold them, so it has an obligation to support them.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-learn-from-car-thing-2">What can we learn from Car Thing?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4dzE8xxgM56WCMfvXzgueb" name="Spotify-Car-Thing-voice.jpg" alt="Using voice access on Spotify Car Thing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4dzE8xxgM56WCMfvXzgueb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, I want to emphasize that there&apos;s still time for Spotify to right this wrong, and I hope the negative sentiment around the company&apos;s actions causes it to rethink its approach. We just saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/sony-apologies-and-says-theyre-removing-the-requirement-for-a-psn-account-on-helldivers-2-a-day-after-removing-it-from-steam-for-over-2-billion-people">Sony reverse course</a> on a decision it made to require PSN accounts for the game Helldivers 2 following public pressure, so it&apos;s possible. While refunds for Car Thing are probably unlikely, I think Spotify offering a credit that could be used for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-price-increase-new-plans-claims">Spotify Premium</a> subscriptions would be a fair resolution to the issue. </p><p>Moving forward, Spotify&apos;s treatment of Car Thing should serve as a reminder for consumers to be wary of buying hardware from software companies, especially when said hardware is dependent on services, because it usually doesn&apos;t end well. If this situation doesn&apos;t make you reconsider supporting Spotify as a company, at least let it be a warning for buying server-supported hardware in the future.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out another iterative update for the Android 14 QPR3 beta, which aims to continue to sort out some issues with the software ahead of the stable release.</p><p>The company announced the start of Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cyzh41/android_14_qpr3_beta_22_now_available/">on Reddit</a> with build number AP21.240305.006. The May 2024 security patch is included in this for the following supported devices: Pixel 5a, 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, and Pixel Tablet.</p><p>This patch is notably smaller than Beta 2.1, with Google only highlighting two fixes in the latest version.</p><p>Enrolled Pixel users are receiving a fix for dropped cellular connections. The company states users have continuously reported such problems despite having a strong connection to a cellular network. Many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/322380000">reports</a> were from users with a Pixel 7 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/315328193">a 5G network</a> from Mint and T-Mobile.</p><p>Google ends its patch notes by stating the final fix aims to solve "various other issues that were impacting system stability and connectivity."</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cyzh41/android_14_qpr3_beta_22_now_available"> Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.2 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The current known issues with Beta 2 include an issue with sideloading the software, which has caused some devices to fail to boot properly. Additionally, the At a Glance widget may display the weather for the wrong location.</p><p>Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.2 is rolling out as an OTA (over-the-air) update for all previously mentioned supported Pixels. Google states it may take up to 24 hours before your device picks up the OTA update. If you&apos;re curious, you can hop into your <strong>Settings > System > System updates </strong>to see if your device is ready.</p><p>The last update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Beta 2.1</a> arrived on April 1. The company aimed to correct a host of bugs that plagued Pixel testers soon after installing the original Beta 2. Among the problems, Google corrected Pixel launcher crashes, an inability for the Pixel Tablet to charge with its dock, a Pixel Fold display issue, and more.</p>

This deal doesn&apos;t require a trade-in, and it cuts over $23 a month off of the normal installment price for the Razr Plus. This phone is also one of our favorites as far as flip or foldable phones go, sporting a beautiful cover display, quick performance, and pretty great charging speeds.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> is a verifiably premium foldable phone, and it's currently on sale at AT&T for $2.99 a month with a qualifying unlimited data plan. The deal doesn't even require a trade-in, and you can either add the phone to an existing unlimited data plan or start a new one.</p>
<p>The Razr Plus offers a performance-tier upgrade from the Razr, and this particular deal is for the black version of the phone. Perhaps best of all is the flip phone's beautiful cover display, offering a super useful interface that can even help improve battery life.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/motorola-razrplus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="32e0258e-ef3c-4eb2-b8ba-269d663ccd90" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$27.78/mo" data-dimension48="$27.78/mo">View Deal</a></p></div>

It has a stylish clamshell design that can be compared to a slim version of a Gameboy Advance SP (real ones know), and the hinge feels sturdy.</p><p>Plus, it&apos;s well-liked for its fluid movement between inner and outer screens, and its smooth, quick performance, as backed by the powerful Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor. It also comes with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, three microphones, and stereo speakers.</p><p>The Razr Plus admittedly doesn&apos;t have the best battery life, typically not even lasting a full day without needing to be charged. However, using the cover screen can offer some pretty substantial battery improvements, if you think that may help. And with installments of only $2.99 a month, you can&apos;t really go wrong with trying it out given its other positives.</p>

<ul><li>Garmin Venu Sq 2 owners were unable to download apps or watch faces in April and May.</li><li>Garmin eventually patched the problem in its "backend" after over a month of forum complaints. </li><li>Issues with fitness watches' firmware and updates have been on the rise in recent years, across brands. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitness watches get more post-launch updates than they used to. In theory, this is a good thing. In practice, brands like Garmin and Fitbit are struggling to keep up with their ambitious goals. </p><p>Earlier this week, a reader alerted me to an "aggravating" issue with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a>, one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">favorite Garmin watches</a>. For the past month, no one with the Sq 2 or Music edition could connect to Connect IQ. That meant no Spotify, Komoot, new watch faces, or any other third-party apps. Weeks after the issue arose, Garmin Support opened a ticket, then went radio silent, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/sports-fitness/healthandwellness/f/venu-sq-2/367841/unable-to-download-any-app-on-garmin-venu-sq2-music-edition/" target="_blank">frustrating forum users</a> who began threatening to return their Venus. </p><p>Then, shortly after sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Venu-Sq-2-Garmin-acknowledges-app-and-watch-face-installation-issues-allegedly-caused-by-firmware-update.840339.0.html">Notebook Check</a> began reporting on the issue, Garmin engineers "fixed an error in the backend" that had prevented Venu Sq 2 watches and the Garmin servers from communicating. Users agreed that the issue had been fixed without any update on their end; some asked what the holdup had been before the thread was closed. </p><p>The Venu Sq 2 is a kind of gateway product for Garmin. Its relatively affordable price and lightweight squircle design make it an easier transition for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> users or fans of other cheap fitness watches, who might find other Garmins too rugged, expensive, or niche. So for new Venu Sq 2 owners — especially those that paid $50 extra for music storage — to lack access to apps for over a month is a big deal.</p>

<p>Garmin has also faced complaints in the past couple of months about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-update-1822-adds-great-features-but-introduces-heart-rate-issues">Garmin Forerunner update</a> with an accidental side effect: it allegedly caused watches&apos; optical HR sensors to underestimate heart rate data significantly. </p><p>In my case, I&apos;ll notice during hard track runs with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> that my heart rate is about 30–40 bpm too low for a lap or so before it autocorrects. Otherwise, it performed very well in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">Garmin vs. Coros vs. Polar test</a> for heart rate, but unfortunately, other users still report unresolved issues with high or low HR more regularly, even months later. </p><p>While these longstanding issues don&apos;t look great for Garmin, I&apos;ll note that buggy software updates with inadvertent consequences seem to be a worrying trend with fitness watches and trackers recently. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gJEjw8hCxLdEDup98vwxhG" name="fitbit-charge-5-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 Lifestyle 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJEjw8hCxLdEDup98vwxhG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>I immediately remembered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-5-update-allegedly-bricking-wearables-google-denies">Fitbit Charge 5 fiasco</a> earlier this year: Fitbit updated the Charge 5 with new clock faces and languages, with the unintended side effect of overworking the Charge 5 battery to the point that users reported the 7-day fitness tracker could only last half a day at most. A month later, tech sites caught wind of the issue; Fitbit said the update wasn&apos;t to blame without explaining why Charge 5 trackers broke after factory resets or could no longer track sleep. </p><p>I&apos;m not certain if this problem was ever resolved. At the time, Google gave users 50% discounts for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Charge 6</a> replacement, but many long-time Fitbit fans swore off the brand for good. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-orthostatic-test-result.jpeg" alt=""Test result: your cardio system is recovered" screen on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I positively reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a>, it too had a rough start. My review unit would crash during any long hiking or running activity, causing a boot loop that would only end when the battery ran out or I found a way to factory reset it. Other reviewers and day-one buyers reported similar issues.</p><p>The latest firmware updates did nothing to resolve the problem, so Polar sent me a new watch. This unit never crashed once in the month or so I used it. The fact remains, however, that Polar couldn&apos;t find a way to resolve this major software issue remotely. Then it delayed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-grit-x2-pro-launch">Polar Grit X2 Pro launch</a> to take more time resolving firmware issues.</p><p>No matter which fitness brand you prefer, you&apos;re more likely to run into serious software issues these days. I suspect there&apos;s one clear culprit: ambition. </p>
<h2 id="too-many-watches-not-enough-support-2">Too many watches, not enough support</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="u4fZiakWkjhXjsRFHdHV6i" name="Garmin-watches-HERO.jpeg" alt="A bunch of Garmin watches sitting on a table: The Venu 3, Forerunner 965, 955, 265, and 255 Music, Instinct 2 Solar and 2X Solar, and Vivomove Trend." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4fZiakWkjhXjsRFHdHV6i.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;re seeing a trend today where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-and-fitness-watches-tried-stealing-each-others-tricks-in-2023">fitness watches are trying to become smartwatches</a> to compete with mainline smartwatches. Because of that, brands like Garmin and Fitbit are dedicating more effort to post-launch updates to keep their watches relevant for years — just as a Galaxy or Apple Watch gets three or four years of feature updates and support.</p><p>Mainline smartwatches also have more powerful CPUs, more resources, and fewer models. If Samsung wants to test a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> feature, it must check the Galaxy Watch 4, 5, 5 Pro, and 6. That&apos;s not unreasonable for such a massive company. </p><p>Garmin sells <em>dozens</em> of watches at any given moment. Even if they share the same general software and UI, a $1,000 Fenix has more powerful capabilities than a $250 Venu Sq 2. So, each watch gets its own updates and (presumably) requires its own QA testing with every new feature update. </p><p>Most other fitness brands take a similar multi-device approach. Amazfit sells about 20 smartwatches, not counting its older models, which still receive support. Google and Fitbit have about 10 products combined. COROS only has four watches but still updates watches released years ago with brand-new software like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-adds-turn-by-turn-navigation-watch-faces-more">turn-by-turn navigation</a>. </p><p>With so many watches on the market at once, made by brands with smaller teams, bugs are bound to slip through the cracks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RrydbCbKoH4UkGrhdokiYc" name="garmin-venu-sq-2-watch-face-on-wrist.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu Sq 2 watch face at breakfast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrydbCbKoH4UkGrhdokiYc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin&apos;s forums are full of bug reports; some are specific to one broken watch, and others are down to user error. So when a <em>real</em>, widespread bug shows up, like the Venu Sq 2&apos;s app block or the Forerunners&apos; HR inaccuracies, the support team will respond with canned advice until enough people yell about it for them to escalate the issue. And even then, it may take time to find a proper solution. </p><p>Again, this isn&apos;t about Garmin specifically. Other brands might have taken longer to acknowledge the problem, or fail to pin down the problem&apos;s cause. It&apos;s about the fact that these brands used to launch a product and then move on to the next one, rarely adding more than a few new features after launch. That made it easier to avoid bugs. </p><p>Now that users expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-brands-need-to-guarantee-proper-software-updates">proper post-launch software updates</a> for fitness watches, these brands have to squeeze features onto chips that were optimized at launch for as much battery life as possible. In some cases, that&apos;s likely to cause problems, and athletes with a previously functional watch have to spend weeks waiting for a solution. And with so many watches on the market, you never know if yours will slip through the cracks. </p>
