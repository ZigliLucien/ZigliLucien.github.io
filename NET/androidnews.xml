<p>X (formerly Twitter) is trying to capitalize on the rocky TikTok scene. The platform came up with its own video "feed" by adding a new tab to the explore page that just showcases videos for users to scroll through. In a tweet, the social media platform joked about "not making a video tab" while posting a video showcasing the same.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you better not be making a dedicated video tab when I get homeme: pic.twitter.com/ZbmLBmSbDp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1881169030876381414">January 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The new "immersive new home for videos" was rolled out to U.S.-based users yesterday (Jan. 19) and showcased a vertical video tab mimicking TikTok/Instagram reels based on the user's interest/accounts they follow.</p><p>Considering the platform was banned for roughly half a day over the weekend, other social media sites wanted to leverage this and came up with their versions to slide into user's DMs.</p><p>For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tries-to-capitalize-on-tiktok-uncertainty-with-new-edits-app">Instagram introduced a new "edits"</a> app resembling CapCut, a video editing software from ByteDance. "Edits is a free video editor that makes it easy for creators to turn their ideas into videos, right on their phone. It has all the tools you need to support your creation process, all in one place."</p><p>X showcases videos that go along with its tweets. However, this feed seems to give users a combination of videos that are both in a 9:16 aspect ratio and as well as landscape ones, much like Instagram (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/x-twitter-dedicated-vertical-video-tab/" target="_blank">via Android Police</a>).</p><p>From the looks of it, this feature is currently only available on the mobile app and showcases minute-long videos.  There's not much information as to whether this tab will become available to people outside the U.S., and if so, when can we expect a broader rollout to happen?</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. TikTok users rejoiced as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us" target="_blank">the app made a comeback </a>over the weekend after the ban went into effect and the app went dark. The official TikTok Policy account on X (formerly Twitter) shared a statement on Sunday, Jan. 19, announcing that it restored service as a result of President Trump's support.</p><p>The company wrote in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tiktokpolicy/status/1881030712188346459?s=46" target="_blank">post,</a> "We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."</p>

<ul><li>A recent report alleges that Samsung is preparing to begin production of its tri-fold device in Q2 with roughly 200,000 units planned "over a year."</li><li>Rumors add that the next Galaxy Z Fold 7 could lack an S Pen digitizer, meaning the stylus would be separate and require charging.</li><li>Past rumors claimed a possible Samsung tri-fold might not see an under-display camera while another set claimed the next Fold could see a thicker larger S Pen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent set of rumors could more information regarding Samsung's foldable outlook in 2025.</p><p>The rumors were summarized by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1881222623725776983">Jukanlosreve</a> on X, sourced from a YouTube report by Korean publication, TheElec (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/20/samsung-tri-fold-2025-foldable-plans/">9to5Google</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/PntU-UBDnWQ">video alleges</a> that Samsung long rumored tri-fold (or double-folding) phone will feature a "9.9 to 10-inch screen" when unfolded. Additionally, the report purports that the Korean OEM could produce roughly 200,000 units of the tri-fold style device for consumers.</p><p>The tipster on X chimed into a reply about the rumored number of units. Jukanlosreve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1881226660177236380">claims</a> that the number "is limited to the tri-fold;" however, Samsung is supposedly looking to reach that number "over the course of a year."</p><p>Samsung will allegedly begin production on its Galaxy tri-fold in Q2, which gives us a timeframe between April and June.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Korean report continues by stating the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is on its way this year, but it could lack an S Pen digitizer. A Fold <em>without </em>a digitizer was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">rumored in November</a> with a report claiming it could help make the device thinner — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Fold 6 Special Edition</a>. The tipster adds that there's a "high chance" for this to happen in 2025.</p><p>The primary difference here is that the Fold 6 Special Edition does not support the S Pen at all alongside its lack of a digitizer to make it slimmer. The previous report suggests Samsung is interested in crafting a Fold that lacks a digitizer but still supports the S Pen, kind of like the current rumors.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Korean publication's video claims there are a two more foldables expected: the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Flip 7 FE. The devices are rumored to launch in Q3 2025, which lines up with Samsung's past summer Unpacked events.</p>

<p>Another rumor from earlier in January claimed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored">2025 would be the year</a> Samsung revealed its double-folding phone. Rumors stated the company could debut the phone without a UDC (under-display camera). Also, the device could fold in a "G" shape for durability and screen protection purposes. Samsung Display was also rumored to have new screen tech ready to debut, which could happen during MWC 2025.</p><p>That same rumor added that Samsung could produce "under 300,000" units. Current speculation suggests around 200,000, something that might have to deal with its interest in slashing foldable totals <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">after a lackluster 2024</a>.</p><p>Regarding the Fold 7's S Pen digitizer, removing it could force users to have an S Pen <em>they </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-fold-phone-might-work-with-an-s-pen-you-need-to-charge">need to charge</a> instead of letting the phone handle it. Such an idea was put forth late last year as a Korean report claimed Samsung was looking to change its S Pen hardware and opt for one that's slightly larger. The stylus would also (likely) leverage active electrostatic (AES) technology to manage its own operations.</p>

<ul><li>After witnessing the Galaxy S25 Slim recently, a new leak reveals the regional availability of the handset.</li><li>The slimmer form factor Galaxy S25 series device will probably see its launch in countries like the U.K., India, and Australia among 39 regions.</li><li>However, the United States doesn’t appear to be on the list, corroborating the earlier reports of the same.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung releasing a fourth Galaxy S25 device out of the traditional trio of devices in the upcoming Unpacked event was already a surprise for many. It is likely to be dubbed the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim and is now tipped to launch in at least 39 regions.</p><p>The region availability information was obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/exclusive-the-galaxy-s25-slim-may-land-only-in-these-locations_id166780">PhoneArena</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-slim-launch-only-39-countries/">SamMobile</a>), and the list seems to omit the U.S. region. The other regions where we are likely to see the new Galaxy S25 Slim launch include:</p>
<ul><li>Afghanistan</li><li>Australia</li><li>Austria</li><li>Brazil</li><li>Caucasus</li><li>Croatia</li><li>Egypt</li><li>France</li><li>India</li><li>Iraq</li><li>Ireland</li><li>Israel</li><li>Kazakhstan</li><li>Kenya</li><li>Libya</li><li>Malaysia</li><li>Mexico</li><li>Morocco</li><li>Nigeria</li><li>Pakistan</li><li>Philippines</li><li>Poland</li><li>Portugal</li><li>Russia</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>Senegal</li><li>Serbia/Montenegro</li><li>Singapore</li><li>Slovenia</li><li>South Africa</li><li>Sri Lanka</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Thailand</li><li>Tunisia</li><li>Turkey</li><li>UAE</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Uzbekistan</li><li>Vietnam</li></ul>
<p>Several rumors have been floating about the Galaxy S25 Slim’s availability for a while now, and there were speculations about the handset's release at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank">Unpacked Event</a> as well—which is commencing this Wednesday (Jan 22) in the U.S. alongside other regions, including South Korea's home ground.</p><p>Regardless of the launch and availability of the Galaxy S25 Slim, it is an interesting handset from Samsung to look forward to. The latest addition might be a notable option to choose from for those who are waiting to purchase the Galaxy S25 trio.</p><p>Although the design should resemble the other Galaxy S25 models like rounded corners, a triple camera array, and thinner bezels, the slimmer form factor of the handset appears to be the key takeaway — at least that appears to be the parameter — per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">recently leaked renders</a>.</p>

<p>In comparison, the Galaxy S25 Slim should be measuring 6.4mm in thickness, which is supposedly 1.8mm thinner than the alleged Galaxy S25 Ultra phone. The overall dimensions of the device are likely to be set at 159x76x6.4mm.</p><p>Other specs of the slimmer Galaxy S25 device include a Snapdragon 8 Elite Galaxy chipset coupled with at least 12GB of RAM. The triple camera array could include a 200MP primary lens, next to a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 50MP ALoP telephoto camera offering 3.5x zoom.</p><p>If not at the upcoming Unpacked event, we are likely to see the Galaxy S25 Slim sometime in the second quarter of this year probably right before the usual launch of Galaxy foldable phones.</p>

<ul><li>Another discovery involves the rumored ASUS ROG Phone 9 "FE" in a pair of certification listings overseas.</li><li>The device has apparently surfaced in Malaysia and Thailand, with rumors pointing — once again — to a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 decision.</li><li>The "FE" phone reportedly grabbed Wi-Fi Alliance certification in November as it was tested with Android 14.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent discovery might tell us a little more about the upcoming, Samsung-like "fan edition" phone from ASUS.</p><p>The latest ROG Phone 9 "FE" discovery surfaces courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-phone-9-fe-kantongi-sertifikat-pertanda-akan-segera-rilis/">91Mobiles</a> from the SIRIM certification database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/asus_rog_phone_9_fe_is_coming_and_it_might_be_familiar-news-66170.php">GSMArena</a>). More exciting specifications like its features, display, and cameras are reportedly still unknown. However, the publication claims the device could feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC.</p><p>This chip theory allegedly stems from the model number in the Phone 9 FE's files. According to data from a Malaysian and Thailand listing, the device is codenamed "ASUS_AI2401_N." The publication then ties this number to the one used for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-series-launch">Phone 8 series</a>: "AI2501C." The series dropped at the beginning of January 2024 with the SD 8 Gen 3, which leads to the recent assumptions that the company's Phone 9 FE could contain the same.</p><p>The chip did wonders to help phones in 2024 with on-device AI capabilities, a push ASUS made with its Phone 8 <em>and </em>Phone 9 series.</p><p>Additionally, there's some speculation that the device could see a launch in the southeast Asia region "soon."</p>

<p>Rumors of an ASUS ROG Phone 9 FE cropped up last November when the device allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-fe-databse-listing-rumors">showed up in a Wi-Fi Alliance</a> listing. The certification database stated the phone was being tested with Android 14; however, others theorize it could see Android 15 by the time it's in our hands. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity is expected. Moreover, that listing is what originally put the idea of a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 swap in our minds — and the latest rumors double down on it.</p><p>For context, the flagship Phone 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Phone 9 Pro</a> debuted in November 2024 with Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC. That chip drastically improved the power and efficiency of the company's chips with the new Oryon CPU cores. More importantly, the chip has consistently been reported to be more costly due to its vast improvements.</p><p>If ASUS is interested in going down a similar "fan edition" or FE route as Samsung, then dropping its chip to one from a generation prior could help. An FE tag screams affordability, but a change in the chipset won't get this done alone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-series-launch">main flagship duo</a> offers a 6.7-inch display and a triple camera array; however, the base Phone 9 starts at $999. It also features a 50MP primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 5MP macro camera instead of a telephoto.</p><p>So, perhaps ASUS will look at toning down its on-device AI gaming features or its cooling capabilities (but hopefully not). A launch date hasn't been narrowed down yet, so we'll just have to keep waiting.</p>

<ul><li>An early set of Google leaks claimed to have spotted the company's Pixel 10a and Pixel 11 series development.</li><li>The Pixel 10a is allegedly being developed with the "slightly boosted" Tensor G4, while four codenames for the Pixel 11 series drops.</li><li>Previous rumors claim that Google will place the stronger Tensor G5 into the Pixel 10 series in 2025, which recently had its supposed set of four codenames leak.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>These Google Pixel leaks might catch you off guard as a tipster picked up on an alleged set of devices in development.</p><p>According to prominent leaker Kamila Wojciechowska (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-10a-pixel-11-codename-3516163/">Android Authority</a>), Google has reportedly started working on five new Pixel phones. Among the devices, the tipster states that Google is already developing its planned Pixel 10a, codename "STA5." This leak is extremely early, seeing as the company's flagship Pixel 10 series won't arrive until later in 2025.</p><p>Regardless, the post claims the Pixel 10a <em>could </em>debut with the same Tensor G4 the Pixel 9 series features. If you remember, the Tensor G4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">didn't receive the huge improvements</a> we were looking for.</p><p>Speculation suggests the Pixel 10a will debut in 2026; a safe assumption, considering the "A-series" Pixel never arrives the same year as the flagships.</p><p>Elsewhere, Wojciechowska has allegedly discovered the internal codenames for the 2026 Pixel 11 series. The tipster reportedly found four devices: "cubs," "grizzly," "kodiak," and "yogi." These names refer to the Pixel 11, Pixel 11 Pro, Pixel 11 Pro XL, and the Pixel 11 Pro Fold, respectively. The post states the series will likely rock the Tensor G6 SoC. It's a likely scenario given the recent struggles and shifts Google has had to make with its custom chipset.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A4wRsPwjhJssSQAt24Uq6P" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Top-down view of Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4wRsPwjhJssSQAt24Uq6P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">benchmarking tests</a> for the Tensor G4, it was clear that Google made a few improvements with it over the G3. While the chip wasn't surprising anyone — and certainly not outdoing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> — it did help cut down on the Pixel line's long history of overheating issues. However, that only seemed to concern the higher-tier devices, like the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>The base Pixel 9 still got warm, just not <em>as much </em>as previous generations.</p><p>Google had reportedly encountered severe problems with its teams centered behind the Tensor G4, which led to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">delay in the original project</a>: Redondo. Essentially, Google reportedly had to lean on Samsung once more for the chip inside the Pixel 9 series, which brought onboard a 4nm, third-generation SF4P process chip. The tech behind it was stated to offer a "slight" upgrade over the G3 and we've seen those effects since launch.</p><p>What we've turned our attention to since is the Pixel 10 series. Those devices should sport Google's completely custom, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">in-house Tensor G5 chip</a>. A January 2024 report claimed that Google had already started testing its chip ahead of its TSMC switch for the Pixel 10 under "project laguna."

<ul><li>After rolling out two developer previews of Android 16, the search giant is likely to launch its first beta this month.</li><li>According to a recent comment from a Googler, we are likely to see the first betas of Android 16 on January 22, February 19, and March 12, respectively.</li><li>We will likely see a couple more updates, followed by the official rollout in the second quarter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google began early previews of the much-anticipated Android 16 last November with the rollout of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">first developer preview</a>. Very quickly, the next version of the operating system followed. However, a new tip has now indicated we might be seeing the first beta releases to the public as soon as this week to the masses.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-beta-release-date-3517882/">Android Authority</a> contributor AssembleDebug’s new findings, we are likely to see the first beta rollout of Android 16 as early as January 22—right in time for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank">Unpacked event,</a> where Samsung is preparing to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, the second beta is believed to be coming on February 19, and the Android 16 beta 3 should be arriving on March 12 to compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:81.86%;"><img id="nQ278YNY7o3uYW4vscPLXa" name="Android-16-beta-release-dates-leak" alt="Android 16 betas release dates leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQ278YNY7o3uYW4vscPLXa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="733" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug/ Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The release schedules’ dates are spotted through a comment on Android Gerrit — made by a Googler — and it evidently puts the Android 16 beta releases significantly months before when compared to the previous iteration, Android 15 beta releases.</p><p>Google has already noted that Android 16 will have an earlier official rollout than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, and the released Android 16 developer previews were already an indication. New findings from the publication only reaffirm the case.</p><p>As mentioned, the Android 16 is expected to ship to Pixel devices by the second quarter of this year, which usually wasn’t the case before. The publication further notes that with the hinted beta release schedule, the latest operating system from Google is likely to arrive at a stable state after which, users can expect a couple of other beta releases followed by the official rollout. It could mean right before the Google IO event, which is yet to be announced by the search giant.</p>

<p>The Android 16 developer previews, on the other hand, introduced several new notable features. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-just-landed-for-google-pixels-and-non-pixel-devices-too">second preview</a> version has introduced “private space, ” which happens to be a new privacy-focused functionality allowing users to hide important apps in a secure and separate profile. Alongside such features, new security measures are also in place with Android 16.</p>

In this case, it is audio cables; Effect Audio is a brand that makes high-quality audio cables, and the Code 24 is the latest product. <br><br>What makes its cables stand out, you ask? Well, a lot of it is down to the quality of the construction, and the materials used. There's also the design of the cable itself, and having used several dozen IEMs, I'm yet to come across a cable that looks anywhere as good as the Code 24. The caveat obviously is that the cable costs a ridiculous amount of cash — it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.effectaudio.com/code-24">retails for $799</a> — and while it definitely makes a difference to the sound quality and is built to last, it isn't targeted at a mainstream audience.</p>

<p>Before we get to the design, a high-level overview of the construction of the cable itself: the Code 24 uses 16.5AWG gauge wires with UP-OCC silver-plated copper Litz material, and each wire uses a blend of multi-size strands — 13 in this case. The core of the cable is what Effect Audio calls a Trio-Flex Pure Solid Core System, and this contains three wires made out of the same UP-OCC silver-plated copper Litz material. <br><br>Covering all of this is an EA UltraFlexi insulation that gives the Code 24 a decent amount of resilience in daily use. Clearly, a lot of thought and attention went into the construction of the cable, and it is noticeably bulkier than most standard cables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PeC95JEqjT2t7MMkq8BxVi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeC95JEqjT2t7MMkq8BxVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the defining characteristic of the cable has to be the design. The rich blue hue combined with the barrels and gold accents gives the Code 24 a distinct presence, and I can confidently say that this is the best-looking cable I've ever used — photos don't do it justice. The cable has a hybrid design that's braided until the splitter, and then straightens out at the connectors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mFeSNcduNaAMsu4Ejdmtai" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mFeSNcduNaAMsu4Ejdmtai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about connectors, the Code 24 has a 4.4mm plug as standard, but you can get an interchangeable connector that adds 2.5mm and 3.5mm options. On the other end, you get a standard 2-pin connector, and Effect Audio bundles a ConX connector set that includes MMCX as well. It's easy enough to switch between the two, and the versatility means you can use it with any IEMs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iaYBTiM2xCDsNDXZerv9fi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iaYBTiM2xCDsNDXZerv9fi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cable has a standard 1.2 meter length, and because of its construction, it is heavier than just about any other IEM cable I used. Thankfully, you don't notice the heft in daily use, but I wouldn't recommend using these on the road. On that note, Effect Audio includes a decent-quality carrying case with the Code 24, and it securely holds the cable along with IEMs and has inner pockets to accommodate the connector attachments.</p>

<p>I used the cable with a half-dozen IEMs, including the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-review">Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-prestige-ltd-review">Thieaudio Prestige LTD</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/letshuoer-cadenza-12-review">Letshuoer Cadenza 12</a> among others. I paired it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m23-review">M23</a>, and what was immediately noticeable was the elevated low-end; the Code 24 delivers a richer bass with better presence and noticeable impact, and you get a greater texture that's just enjoyable.</p>

<p>The mids remain neutral but with added clarity, and vocals in particular sound great — there's added weight and body to the mix that creates a sense of occasion. There's a hint of sparkle to the treble that adds a bit of warmth, but there's no sibilance or harshness. <br><br>There's terrific resolution throughout, and the soundstage feels expansive; Effect Audio did a brilliant job with the technical details. I'll admit that I was skeptical of the Code 24 as I didn't think it would make any tangible difference to the sound quality — but I was wrong. The cable clearly adds a lot of nuance and dynamics that you just don't get with bundled cables, and this is particularly true of high-end IEMs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FTgZDTbA8rM3vbi2RirEdi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTgZDTbA8rM3vbi2RirEdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, the Code 24 is aimed at enthusiasts looking to get the most out of their IEMs. Justifying the price is difficult, but if you've already invested in top-of-the-line IEMs and want something that will make a genuine difference to the sound, the Code 24 is a great choice.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I covered Stuffcool extensively over the years, and the brand is my go-to recommendation for charging products in India. I used the brand's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-max-power-bank-review">Major Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-ultra-review">Major Ultra power banks</a> in the last year, and while they did an admirable job charging my devices, they're on the bigger end of the scale. <br><br>That's where the Giga comes in. The power bank also has a 20,000mAh battery, but it is considerably smaller, making it easier to carry around. If anything, the design of the power bank reminds me of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/review-ugreen-145w-25000mah-power-bank-review">UGREEN's power banks</a>, with the gunmetal grey color scheme and LED panel similar to what the Chinese manufacturer offers on its own products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3ExPwdaWwxqnr77PRJyX8T" name="Stuffcool Giga" alt="Stuffcool Giga 65W power bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ExPwdaWwxqnr77PRJyX8T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The smaller design is a definite advantage with the Giga, and another feature I like is that the power bank has an integrated 65W USB-C cable; there's a built-in cable tie to ensure it doesn't tangle, and the design means you don't have to dig around in your bag to find a USB-C cable. <br><br>Another point in its favor is that the power bank is on the lighter side at 360g, and just like the design, this makes a difference in portability. The sides have a ridged pattern that makes it that much easier to hold and use the power bank.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oxhQPpthKzNdWVuhHCReBT" name="Stuffcool Giga" alt="Stuffcool Giga 65W power bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxhQPpthKzNdWVuhHCReBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a tiny LED panel at the front that shows remaining battery. I would like liked a bigger panel that highlighted real-time charging info as well, but this is a good starting point nevertheless. Overall, the build quality is on par with the best power banks I used, and there are no qualms in this area. <br><br>Coming to the charging part, you get 65W out via USB PD, and that's enough to charge most phones. Like recent Stuffcool power banks, you get the ability to charge at 65W over the USB PD PPS standard as well, making the Giga a fantastic choice to use with Samsung phones.</p>

<p>I only have two minor issues with the Giga; the power bank is limited to 45W when charging the internal battery, and it takes a lot longer to charge the 20000mAh battery than most other power banks I used in recent months. Also, there's just one USB-C port alongside USB-A, and while this is decent on smaller power banks, it would have been great to get dual USB-C ports. <br><br>Outside of that, there are no problems with the Giga; the power bank managed to deliver a consistent charge when using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a>. If you're interested, here's a rundown of the power profiles:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C Out (65W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB PD PPS Out:</strong> 3.3V - 11V/5A (55W), 3.3V - 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-A Out:</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W), 12V/1.5A (18W)</li><li><strong>USB-C In (45W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/2.25A (45W)</li></ul>
<p>Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Smallest-Powerbank-superfast-fastcharges/dp/B0DMDZF5SV">at ₹3,999 ($46) on Amazon India</a>, the Giga doesn't cost too much more than other 20,000mAh power banks in this category, and the lighter design combined with 65W charging tech makes it a good choice if you need a new power bank — particularly to use with Samsung phones.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta</a> and Instagram are hoping to capitalize on the uncertainty surrounding ByteDance apps by teasing a new one of their own: Edits. Many creators and indie video editors were shocked when CapCut, a popular vertical editing software, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-can-save-tiktok-from-united-states-ban">affected by the TikTok ban</a> enacted Sunday, Jan. 19. The new Edits app is a direct competitor to CapCut announced by Instagram head Adam Mosseri on the very same day the ban of ByteDance apps took effect.</p><p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-classic-stickers-reels-ig-stories">Instagram Reels</a> video announcing the new app, Mosseri directly acknowledged the timing of the move. "There’s a lot going on right now, but no matter what happens, it’s our job to provide the best possible tools for creators," he wrote.</p><p>"Edits, an Instagram app" is already available for pre-order on the Apple App Store, but is not listed on the Google Play Store yet. Mosseri says Edits won't become available for download until next month. The Instagram exec said that Edits will be "coming to Android soon," but it's unclear whether it'll launch on the Play Store at the same time the iOS app becomes available for download next month.</p>

<p>Meta is clearly trying to gain user base and momentum in light of the questionable future for ByteDance apps. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">TikTok became available in the U.S. Sunday</a> following a brief shutdown after earning incoming President Donald Trump's blessing.

It's not the first time Meta used this strategy to launch a competing social media app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-threads-now-live">Meta launched Threads</a>, a Twitter rival, when Elon Musk's changes to X left users scurrying from the platform.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm quietly announced a binned version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with seven cores.</li><li>Offering the same clock speeds as the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite, this new variant has one less performance core.</li><li>This version of Qualcomm's pricey chip could offer reprieve to OEMs struggling to incorporate Snapdragon 8 Elite in their devices without raising prices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm makes the fastest Android mobile chip on the market today, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and its processor lineup looks to be expanding. We've already heard rumors that the brand could be prepping a lower-tier Snapdragon 8s Elite chip and a higher-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-specifications-leaked">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> system-on-a-chip. Now, the chipmaker has quietly announced a separate seven-core Snapdragon 8 Elite variant, according to a newly-listed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/Snapdragon-8-Elite-SM8750-3-AB-Product-Brief.pdf" target="_blank">document</a>.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-7-core-3517839/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, this new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip appears to be identical to the regular version, minus a performance core. It's listed under part number <strong>SM8750-3-AB</strong> on Qualcomm's website. You'll get two Prime cores with this chip, just like the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite, but only five performance cores instead of six.</p><p>This could be a "binned" Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. SoC binning is when a chipmaker offers a lower-cost and lower-performance version of a processor with cores disabled, and it's a way to get usage out of chips that may not meet the general quality control and yield requirements for the regular variant.</p><p>Although one performance core appears to be disabled on this Snapdragon 8 Elite variant, everything else is the same, including the clock speeds. The two Prime cores are clocked at up to 4.32GHz, while the five performance cores are clocked at up to 3.53GHz.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:129.13%;"><img id="LE8EtCa5YaVXJtrCRHyDoM" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-7-Core-Spec-Sheet" alt="A spec sheet for the Snapdragon 8 Elite variant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LE8EtCa5YaVXJtrCRHyDoM.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1030" height="1330" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although this lesser Snapdragon 8 Elite model and its 2+5 configuration will undoubtedly be weaker than the full-fledged Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's unclear by how much. If the binned Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with seven cores provides similar performance to the octa-core Snapdragon 8 Elite, it could be enticing to OEMs. It has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">widely reported that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is more expensive</a> than past Snapdragon chips, and a cheaper chip would be an attractive option for midrange devices.</p><p>However, due to the wide variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship devices</a> that offer an eight-core Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's unlikely that OEMs would be able to use the seven-core variant in a smartphone without offering a lower sticker price.</p><p>We'll have to wait for this new Snapdragon 8 Elite variant to show up in a device to test how it compares to the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite. Additionally, it's worth keeping an eye out for the other Snapdragon 8 Elite revisions rumored to debut soon, like the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite "for Galaxy" and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a>.</p>

On Christmas, I drove to my parents' house with a plastic Safeway bag carrying 13 smartwatches and asked my bemused relatives if they wanted to help me with an article. Most of them had never worn a smartwatch, which made them <em>perfect</em> for my little experiment.</p><p>I poured out a messy pile of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, and an Apple Watch onto my mom's festive tablecloth. Then I told each judge to place them in a row, with the "prettiest or coolest" watches on the left and the "ugliest or most boring" on the right, focusing on which devices they'd "actually want to wear."</p><p>All told, I got 21 participants across generations, ranging from my 80-year-old great-aunt to my teenage nephews and niece. After each vote, I'd mix the watches back into a pile so that the previous person's choices wouldn't influence their decision.</p><p>Why did I rope my relatives into this little experiment? Even though I try to make my smartwatch reviews as objective as possible, focusing on battery life, performance, and fitness accuracy, a lot of people will choose a watch solely based on looks, comfort, and vibes. And I think that can be a blind spot for me.</p><p>I'm happy wearing bulky, sporty watches or heavier models to get better battery life, and I think tech reviewers have gotten used to smartwatches' thick, machine-cut look. But when my mother told me that my Garmin watch looked like a "spaceship on my wrist," it got me thinking that I should try and recalibrate my mental image of a good-looking watch. Hence, the smartwatch beauty pageant!</p><p>CES 2025 kept me busy after the break, but I finally got to tally up the votes this week. And I bet you'll be as surprised by the results of my smartwatch beauty pageant as I was!</p>

In order, they are the OnePlus Watch 2R, Withings ScanWatch 2, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Google Pixel Watch 3, Coros Pace Pro, Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, Garmin Fenix 8, Fitbit Charge 6, Amazfit Cheetah Pro, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, Fitbit Sense, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Garmin Instinct 2X Solar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h35Nrb2WyCqecZVAjYVusQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I chose 13 smartwatches for my test: the Amazfit Cheetah Pro, Apple Watch Ultra 2, Coros Pace Pro, Fitbit Charge 6, Fitbit Sense, Garmin Fenix 8, Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, Google Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus Watch 2R, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Withings ScanWatch 2.</p><p>I tried to have a fair split between "sporty" and "mainstream" watches, as well as expensive and affordable ones. I made a point of including the Charge 6 and Sense to see how a fitness band or a generic-looking squircle would compare in people's minds to fancier or traditional rounded smartwatch designs.</p><p>I wasn't sure whether to include the hybrid ScanWatch 2, as it seemed too different from the rest with its classic look, but I was curious how much non-techy people would care about an old-school impression or if it would feel too old-fashioned for the Gen Zers.</p><p>While I had more smartwatches I considered including, I didn't want to overwhelm my family with too many choices. They came to party and socialize, not do an unpaid survey.</p><p>I chose not to charge my smartwatches before the test; would <em>you</em> want to spend Christmas morning charging watches? I had a justification for it: I wanted people to focus on the watches' physical designs, and I thought brighter displays or prettier watch faces might subconsciously sway their votes. Still, you might disagree with the decision since it's hard to judge how a smartwatch looks without the display turning on.</p><p>Finally, I told my relatives to try and ignore the color of the smartwatch bands when the first couple told me they hated the orange bands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. I assured them that these straps could come in different colors.</p>

<p>The table above shows how many votes each smartwatch received from 1st to 13th place. The table below shows the total points, with the contestants ranked from most to least points. I gave a proportional amount of points for each vote: First place is worth 13 points, second place 12 points, and so on, down to one point for 13th place.</p><p>As you can see, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2</a> crushed the competition, somewhat predictably. Many family members didn't like what <em>most</em> of the smartwatches looked like and told me that the hybrid watch might be the only one they'd seriously consider wearing.</p><p>But you might be somewhat surprised to see the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> come in second. Everyone seemed to love its distinct scale bezel and flat look, preferring its rounded aluminum case to the fancier titanium of many rival watches. Considering the ScanWatch 2 is <em>barely</em> a smartwatch with its tiny OLED display, you could call the Watch 2R the real winner of the pageant.</p>

One person told me it looked like something Master Chief would wear and that she expected Cortana to hop out of it.</p><p>What surprised me more is how little people cared for the three most expensive smartwatches: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> (7th), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> (8th), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> (12th). They all lost to the Fitbit Sense (6th), which one family member called "so generic-looking that it makes me mad." The Sense looked light enough that my female family members, in particular, thought it would be the most comfortable and "ordinary."</p><p>That's a pretty big knock against all the tech reviewers like myself who gave these flagship watches glowing reviews and praised their unique designs. People didn't mind the Fenix 8 because it was flat and "normal-looking," but it was simply too big for a lot of them, and they didn't like how many buttons it had. As for Apple and Samsung, their hard-edged, square-ish looks made them look both artificial and "too massive."</p>

<p>Samsung's older smartwatches did better; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> (4th) divided the voters, with some loving its unique rotating bezel and others finding that it made the watch too big. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> (3rd), which Samsung has all but abandoned, captivated people with the strength of its unique sunken bezel and metallic look.</p><p>Honestly, I can't discount how much people liked the Pro simply because of its shining silver in a sea of black watches. But the white <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">Coros Pace Pro</a> (10th) and titanium-bezel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Amazfit Cheetah Pro</a> (11th) discount that theory a bit. Their brightness only highlighted how "cheap" and "unattractive" they looked, with only a few of my more active relatives appreciating the Pace Pro's lightness for workouts.</p><p>The most polarizing candidate was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> (5th). It was ranked top-four for nearly half of the voters, with three first-place votes from family members who loved its rounded, relatively light look. But other voters had visceral reactions to it looking "like nothing," like a "creepy water drop," or "like a naked chicken breast without any seasoning." My family has a unique way with words.</p>

<p>21 people is a decent focus group, but this test was hardly definitive or properly controlled. In a perfect world, I'd have ensured each watch case and strap was the same color, that the displays were active, and that people weren't peeking at other people's votes out of interest before they voted themselves.</p><p>Still, I feel like I learned some lessons from my experiment:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Size matters. Most people didn't like the tiny Fitbit Charge 6, but they also cared more about a comfortable fit and thin case than a large display.</li><li>People don't care if a big watch is proportionally light thanks to titanium; they'd rather it be compact and won't notice if it's aluminum.</li><li>They cared much more about how the watch looked from the top-down (what they'd see) than from the side (what others would see), which makes the bezel (or lack thereof) extremely important.</li></ol>
<p>This test reminded me why Apple Watches outsell every other brand, beyond name recognition and iPhone dominance. They're thin and petite and safe-looking, and they don't invite unflattering comparisons to non-smart or hybrid watches like rounded smartwatches do.</p><p>Android smartwatches can't help but look "too big" to people outside of the tech space, though the 40mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or 41mm Pixel Watch 3 might escape that label. So even though I prioritize larger displays and batteries and so on, I need to remember when reviewing smartwatches that a lot of people might see my positives as negatives.</p>

Not only does it save me from ads on either platform, but Google has slowly turned YouTube Music into a pretty decent streaming service. There’s a lot to like about it.</p><p>However, I haven't used Spotify since we were in the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic, and even then, I wasn’t subscribed to it. So, I thought it might be good to revisit the app and actually take advantage of Spotify Premium to see what I’ve been missing out on.</p><p>Most of my friends and family use Spotify, and it seems much more omnipresent than the other music streaming apps when it comes to third-party integration. It’s pretty hard to escape Spotify, and using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, I often feel a bit left out when new features are released or when anyone shares links to songs that I can’t listen to because I’m not subscribed.</p><p>After using Spotify exclusively for the past month, here are the things I like about the app, the things I still miss about YouTube Music, and whether or not I could see myself making the switch permanent.</p>

<h2 id="the-features-that-made-me-switch-2">The features that made me switch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU" name="Spotify-Jam" alt="Spotify Jam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The decision to switch didn’t come to me overnight. It’s something that I first considered doing during a New Year’s Eve trip in 2023 when I was in Hawaii with my friends. Someone is usually playing music for us to enjoy while we’re relaxing, playing games, or driving to and fro. Everyone else had Spotify, which I didn’t normally think about much prior to the trip, but there was one feature in particular that made me realize just how much I was missing out.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-jam-sessions-announcement">Spotify Jam</a> is an incredibly useful feature that launched in the fall of 2023. It lets one person set up a “Jam,” which is essentially a queue of tunes that they can invite others to join in on. Anyone in the Jam can add songs and manage the order of songs, making it a collaborative DJing effort.</p><p>I love this feature because it lets everyone mix up the music queue and show off each others' music preferences. I have a pretty eclectic taste in music, and while my friends enjoy it when I DJ, I know my tastes don’t always agree with everyone in the room, and there are certain genres or songs that I may not be too privy to that others may love.</p><p>Because of this, I made a point to make the switch to Spotify Premium ahead of our 2024 New Year’s Eve trip so that I could a Jam myself since I was the main one DJing this time around with my new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1</a>. Spotify Jam also made it so I didn’t have to set up a playlist beforehand, which saved me a lot of time as we would just create a queue in real time. This feature alone made it worth subscribing to Premium, and if you’re late to the party and haven’t tried this feature out yet, I recommend it the next time you and your friends get together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U" name="Spotify-Smart-Shuffle" alt="Spotify Shuffle options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another feature I absolutely love is a bit less flashy but almost as important to me. Spotify has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-new-home-feed-previews">Smart Shuffle</a> feature that will insert songs it thinks you will like when you shuffle a playlist you’ve created.</p><p>I sometimes find it difficult to discover new music, as I often become comfortable with what I know and like. I have several playlists that I cycle through depending on my mood, and so I’m very familiar with just about every song. I’ll often add a song every so often, but my playlists tend to stay pretty stagnant. This is why I like the Smart Shuffle feature so much; it keeps me in familiar territory while giving me something new to listen to that matches the other tunes in my playlist; that way, it doesn’t stick out so much or ruin the vibe.</p><p>Spotify’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-ai-dj-curated-music">AI DJ</a> was also a feature I was really intrigued by, as it’s seemingly yet another way to discover tunes based on the music you like. The AI-generated DJ interjects every few songs to set up your listening experience, changing the vibe every so often with songs you’re familiar with or may like. It’s a unique feature that I find quite music, as it almost feels like you’re listening to the radio, something I don’t do much of these days.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1303px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="99Zc2AYEwfZBg6QiSTfa4j" name="spotify-ai-dj-hero-wide.jpg" alt="Spotify's new AI DJ in the mobile app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99Zc2AYEwfZBg6QiSTfa4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1303" height="732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the execution is far from perfect. The DJ will often switch to genres or artists that I have zero interest in, and I feel like it will jump in to change the vibe of the tunes a little too often. Sometimes, I just want to stay in the same vibe or feeling for a while, and the DJ will switch things up at a whim, which feels quite jarring at times.</p><p>No doubt it’s a cool feature, one I think Spotify should tweak a bit. However, it does highlight one of my biggest problems with switching to Spotify, one that makes me miss YouTube Music.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-miss-about-youtube-music-2">Things I miss about YouTube Music</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4141px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7X3A6kvqLQFqcU7ByhXv5U" name="Spotify-and-YouTube-Music-1" alt="Two phones next to each other with Spotify and YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7X3A6kvqLQFqcU7ByhXv5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4141" height="2329" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the best things about YouTube Music is that the app seemed to know me before I even started using it. When I first subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> over the pandemic, I was surprised at how well the app was able to guess my tastes by recommending songs that I ended up loving. This is because YouTube Music is tied to the main YouTube app, and so my music searches throughout the years would influence YouTube Music’s knowledge of me.</p><p>This is something I am struggling with when it comes to Spotify. The app’s music recommendations just feel subpar compared to my experience with YouTube Music, and I find myself skipping songs more often than not. That’s not to say it’s all bad, and the songs that show up in Smart Shuffle are often great. But whether it’s via a song radio or the AI DJ, Spotify doesn’t seem to really get me.</p><p>Of course, I recognize that this is more of a growing pains situation and that the app will have to take some time to get used to my tastes. My previous experiences with Spotify were pretty limited, so it doesn’t have much to go on, which is evident whenever I compare my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">Spotify Wrapped and YouTube Music Recap</a> every year. I can't be too hard on the app for not fully understanding my tastes, but I find that this is something that often makes me want to go back to YouTube Music.</p>

<p>Another thing that I find lacking on Spotify is the selection of music, but not so much in the way you might think. I’m a big fan of remixes and often prefer them over the original mix. Spotify has a vast selection of music and remixes, but I’ve learned pretty quickly that this is still pretty limited compared to YouTube Music.</p><p>The thing about YouTube Music is that its connection to YouTube makes it a much stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming platform</a>, in my opinion. I find some of the coolest remixes completely out of the blue, and even when a particular song or mix isn’t available as a music track, I still have instant access to the song via a YouTube video without ever having to leave the app. And as a nice bonus, I can watch full music videos if I want to, which comes in handy when I’m on the treadmill and need visual stimulation.</p><p>I’ve already become pretty disappointed at the fact that I can’t find many of my favorite mixes on Spotify, but the lack of music videos right now is also pretty disappointing. Spotify may be a music streaming service with a focus on audio, but music videos are a pretty fundamental part of the music listening experience.</p>

<p>After using Spotify for a couple of months, it's clear to me why it's such a popular platform. The app experience feels much more mature, for lack of a better word, and Spotify has a lot going for it despite the long wait for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-tier-code-deep-dive">long-awaited Hi-Fi tier</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google is continuously tweaking the YouTube Music UI on what feels like a daily basis. It feels like Google is trying to slowly turn YouTube Music into a Spotify clone, which isn't a bad thing, but it speaks volumes to just how good of an app experience it is.</p><p>That said, while Spotify is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-central-best-of-2024-apps-services">a favorite of ours here at Android Central</a>, with some genuinely fun and useful features, the biggest thing keeping me from staying in the actual <em>music</em> experience. Spotify just doesn't know me as well as YouTube Music, and I'm not sure I want to put in much more effort teaching Spotify to learn about my likes and dislikes. After all, I'm here to listen to music that I want to hear, and right now, YouTube Music knows exactly what that is.</p><p>For now, I'll continue using Spotify to see how things improve, but there's a good chance I'll go back to YouTube Music for my music needs.</p>

It's all happening and slated to kick off on Wednesday, January 22 at 1 PM ET, and we’ll have boots on the ground at the event.</p><p>So buckle up, because it looks like Samsung is looking to make a huge splash and put the rest of the market on notice. <br></p><p>Here's our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 ultimate guide</a> which we will update as often as possible! <br><br>Samsung will livestream the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_6778354209855141653&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>.</p><p>For now, stay tuned; we're going to keep updating this live blog with everything we know so far!</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HinL5jCy_oI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p>If you already know that you’re going to pick up one of the new Galaxy S25 models, you don’t have to wait just to save some money. All you have to do is head over to the Samsung Galaxy Reserve landing page, enter your information, and voila! You’ll save $50 right off the bat, but will also be able to save an additional $1,250 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">when trading in your old phone</a>.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s take a look at everything that has been leaked or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors">rumored about Samsung’s upcoming flagship phones</a>. Starting out with the Galaxy S25, the rumor mill didn’t really start picking up until the second half of the year. <br><br>Before that, a rumor back in June suggested that the regular Galaxy S25 wouldn’t see any meaningful camera upgrades. This would mean that the Galaxy S25 would sport a 50MP main lens, along with a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto sensor offering 3x optical zoom.</p>
<p>One of the big questions was whether Samsung would opt to stick with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-may-be-all-snapdragon-again-not-all-exynos">Qualcomm</a> for the Galaxy S25 series, or if we would see Exynos chips. According to a report by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Samsung’s production of its latest Exynos SoC ended up with a “lower-than-expected yield.”</p><p>Because of this, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-bye-exynos-qualcomm-galaxy-s25-rumor">Samsung would</a> instead rely on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, which turned out to be called the Snapdragon 8 Elite. This initial report was corroborated by a separate rumor, which also suggested Samsung would opt for Qualcomm across the board, instead of utilizing its Exynos chips in certain regions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wasn’t until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">September 2024</a> that we got our first idea of what the Galaxy S25 would actually look like. Honestly, it was rather pedestrian, with the biggest change coming to the rear camera housing, which was said to now sport the same camera rings as what’s found on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>However, this same batch of leaks claimed Samsung will be slimming down the Galaxy S25 a bit, with the following dimensions: “146.9 x 70.4 x 7.2mm, compared to 147.0 x 70.6 x 7.6mm for the S24.” All while still sporting a 6.2-inch display, complete with flat edges and rounded corners.</p>
<p>Shifting gears a bit, if there’s one thing that we’ve complained about for years it’s how far behind the curve Samsung is with charging speeds. While some flagship phones can be recharged in less than an hour, Samsung hasn’t gotten the memo. Unfortunately, after the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-galaxy-s25-plus-charging-speed-leak">passed through China’s 3C</a> for certification, it seems that the 25W charging rate is here to stay for another year.</p>

<p>Although we obviously haven’t seen any official preorder deals quite yet, you can guarantee yourself some early savings by signing up for Samsung’s Galaxy Reserve program. Only your first name, last name, and email address are required, and signing up will get you a $50 voucher and up to $1,250 of trade-in credit when the Galaxy S25 series goes live. You can also be entered into a sweepstakes to win $5,000. There’s no obligation to buy anything, but the deal ends January 22nd, so act fast!</p>
<p>With the company coming off a rather disappointing launch of its latest foldables, there were questions about what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-parts-orders-production-report">Samsung’s Galaxy S25 sales target</a> would look like. In October 2025, a report surfaced claiming Samsung “expects to produce roughly 22 million Galaxy S25 phones by June 2025 and approximately 11 million could be Galaxy S25 Ultras.”</p><p>This would mean that the Galaxy S25 would “account for ~30%” while the S25 Plus is expected to sell a bit better, “as its outlook puts it around 35% to 40% in sales.” As a note, these figures are only for North America and don’t account for global markets.</p>
<p>Switching back to the devices themselves, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">display analyst Ross Young shared</a> the different colors that we can expect to see with the Galaxy S25 lineup. Coming as little surprise, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will share four colors, with the Plus gaining a “Midnight Black” option. Meanwhile, the S25 Ultra is said to be offered in four different shades of Titanium, which include “Titanium Black, Titanium Blue, Titanium Gray, and Titanium Silver.”</p>
<p>In November 2024, Samsung held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-s25-teases-cheaper-foldable-xr-device-2025">most recent earnings call</a>, which provided confirmation that the Galaxy S25 lineup would arrive in the “first half of 2025.” Unsurprisingly, no other details were shared, with the only exception being that the S25 “plans to lead daily innovation by increasing the experience perfection of Galaxy AI and expand sales by strengthening marketing and experience programs.”</p><p>Despite remaining fairly cryptic, Samsung also teased a few other devices, such as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Android XR headset</a> and a cheaper foldable phone. Following Google’s announcement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> late in 2024, we’re keeping our fingers crossed that Samsung at least shows off its upcoming headset. Even if it’s done in the same way that the Galaxy Ring was first officially teased.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="X65GexZdyC98NmHwvCEFNJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-01.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X65GexZdyC98NmHwvCEFNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Less than two weeks after Samsung first confirmed the existence of the Galaxy S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-to-launch-on-january-22-or-23-2025"><u>it was reported</u></a> that the company was “sending consumer surveys to random customers.” Of note, these surveys were looking for opinions about the “promotional aspect of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S25 series.” Upon completion, you would receive a “10% discount on the Galaxy S25 series on January 5.”</p><p>A few days later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-to-launch-on-january-22-or-23-2025"><u>multiple leaks</u></a> began suggesting that Galaxy Unpacked would be held on either January 22 or January 23. Additionally, it was expected that Samsung would host its flagship launch event in San Francisco, following in the same footsteps as the Galaxy S24 launch.</p><p><br>It would have been odd to see pre-orders open on January 5 as it was a Sunday. However, it turns out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025"><u>Samsung announced Galaxy Unpacked</u></a> on January 6, just a day after you would’ve received the discount.</p>
<p><strong>What Galaxy S25 preorder deals can you expect?</strong></p><p>We’re still waiting for an official look at the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect"> <u>Samsung Galaxy S25 preorder deals</u></a>, but our eCommerce Editor Patrick Farmer has spent the last several months speculating on the offers we can expect when the phones go live.</p><p>According to Patrick, if past years are any indication, Samsung will be the first retailer to list its S25 preorder deals online. Be prepared to see some great trade-in opportunities, plus free storage upgrades and exclusive color variants. Carriers like Verizon and AT&T typically follow closely behind Samsung with their own trade-in deals and new customer offers, with offers that might even get you a free phone if you can meet the eligibility requirements. If you prefer unlocked devices, sites like Amazon and Best Buy generally list their stock later in the afternoon with free gift cards and storage upgrades. Of course, this is all just speculation, but we’ll be sure to share the official offers as they go live following Unpacked.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we had only seen unofficial renders of Samsung’s 2025 flagship trio, but two days before Thanksgiving, that all changed. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaks-on-video"><u>post on Reddit</u></a>, someone seemingly managed to get their hands on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, showing it off in a brief video.</p><p>The video doesn’t really reveal too much, as it only shows off half of the phone. But it did practically confirm that Samsung would be opting for a flatter design all the way around. It also revealed that the rear cameras would feature a black ring, similar to what we first saw on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p>
<p>Just hours later, more supposed real-world images of the Galaxy S25 Ultra surfaced. Although it was unclear whether these were from the same person who posted the video on Reddit, these images offered a clearer picture of what to expect.</p><p>On the bottom, the layout remains unchanged, with the S Pen in the bottom-left corner, followed by the speaker, USB-C port, and SIM card tray, in that order. Two other images showed off the notification that appears when the phone is plugged in, along with a close-up of the thinner bezels.</p><p>That wasn’t everything that was shown off, as the leak also provided a few screenshots of One UI 7. At this point, Samsung had not yet released the first beta for Galaxy S24 owners, so it was kind of interesting to see what was in the cards. Unfortunately, the only major change we could see was with the redesigned</p>
<p>The next day, we received an early Christmas present <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-fcc-listing-details-confirmed"><u>courtesy of the FCC</u></a>. All three models of the Galaxy S25 were found in the FCC database, providing confirmation of a few key details. With the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it was discovered that along with continuing to include an S Pen, Samsung was again sticking with 45W wired charging speeds. Other confirmed features included Bluetooth, dual-band Wi-Fi, 5G connectivity, GNSS, and NFC.</p><p>As for the Galaxy S25 Plus, there wasn’t anything really of note here, as it features the “same connectivity specifications as its Ultra sibling.” This includes the 45W wired charging speeds, which doesn’t really come as much of a surprise.</p><p>There was one more surprise, but it was with the “regular” Galaxy S25, and it’s not great. According to the FCC certification, the entry-level flagship would be limited to 9W wireless charging, a downgrade from the 15W speeds found on the Galaxy S24.</p>
<p>By this point, we had a pretty good idea of what the Galaxy S25 lineup is going to offer in terms of design. However, there’s only been a bit of speculation as to the performance of Samsung’s 2025 flagship devices.</p><p>When different S25 models began appearing in benchmarking apps like Geekbench, we assumed that it was reliant on an unannounced Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. However, this really just turned out to be the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which Qualcomm debuted in late October. <br><br>In mid-November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims"><u>leaks and rumors</u></a> began suggesting that not only would all three models be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but that this would also apply to global units. Previously, Samsung released its Qualcomm-powered flagship phones in North America and a few other regions, while the rest of the world got Exynos chips.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even before that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra made an appearance on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4-hits-benchmark"><u>Geekbench</u></a>, powered by Qualcomm’s latest SoC. The benchmark results showed that the S25 Ultra with 12GB of RAM managed a Single-Core score of 3069, along with a Multi-Core Score of 9080.</p><p>What was a bit surprising was that the OnePlus 13 actually outscored the Galaxy S25 Ultra with scores of 3,236 and 10,049. That might seem disappointing until you see that the S24 Ultra offered scores of 2,308 and 7,283. Needless to say, the Snapdragon 8 Elite offers an incredible boost in performance over its predecessor.</p>
<p>Speaking of performance, there’s a pretty good chance that the Galaxy S25 Ultra might have a gaming advantage over some of the other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-likely-to-have-new-game-assist-feature"><u>leaked screenshot</u></a> seemingly revealed that Game Assist will get an upgrade, as one of the bullet points says “Upscaling lets you play games limited to 60Hz at 120Hz.”</p><p>Apparently, this is possible thanks to the Galaxy S25 making use of “Qualcomm’s AFME 2.0 (Adreno Frame Motion Engine) technology, which boosts game performance through frame interpolation.” Essentially meaning that you’ll be able to enjoy upscaled games without sacrificing performance or battery life.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns about the Galaxy S25 series is whether the upgraded SoC and improved design might result in higher prices. Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-alleged-sporadic-price-increase-rumored"><u>rumors claim</u></a> the S25 lineup will end up costing more than the S24 series, at least in some regions.</p><p>This is due to the higher costs associated with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, as Qualcomm reportedly “raised the prices of its technology by roughly 30% when compared to previous generations.” Some have claimed that pricing might remain the same in parts of Europe and the U.S., while other regions will see a “slight increase."</p>
<p>Since the Galaxy S24 debuted, the number of S25 rumors and leaks just continued to grow. Initially, we were under the assumption that Galaxy Unpacked would be host to three new devices, but rumblings of a fourth S25 started cropping up in late 2024. <br><br>This fourth device is now known as the Galaxy S25 Slim, and is reportedly slated to be “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-slim-galaxy-s25-might-be-samsungs-answer-to-apples-rumored-thin-iphone-17"><u>Samsung’s answer to Apple’s rumored thin iPhone 17</u></a>.” However, this could end up being a similar situation as the Galaxy Z Fold SE, which was only released in only South Korea and China.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Slim rumor mill quickly began ramping up after the supposed model number appeared in a database, falling within the same range as the other Galaxy S25 phones. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-early-database-listing-appearance"><u>the leak</u></a>, the S25 Slim carries a model number of SM-S937U, and as is pointed out, the “U” denotes that this should be arriving in the U.S.</p><p>However, it was also at this time that we learned Samsung might not announce the Galaxy S25 Slim alongside the other S25 models. Instead, it would be slated for a “Q2 2025” release, with some narrowing that time frame down to “sometime in April.”</p>
<p>It didn’t take long, but more details were leaked about the Galaxy S25 Slim, including what cameras it might rely on. If these leaks prove to be true, the S25 Slim will share more in common with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-camera-specs-details-rumored"><u>one tipster</u></a>, the S25 Slim will feature the 200MP Isocell HP5 wide-angle sensor, a 50MP Isocell JN5 ultrawide lens, and a 50MP Isocell JN5 telephoto camera. However, in order to make the phone as thin as it can, Samsung is also rumored to lean on its “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed"><u>ALoP (All Lenses on Prism)</u></a>” technology that debuted in November. <br><br>This rumor was mostly corroborated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile"><u>@UniverseIce</u></a> in early January, as the leaker stated that “The Galaxy S25 Slim is equipped with an ‘Ultra’ camera.”</p>
<p>Almost two weeks into the New Year and the S25 Slim made an appearance on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-geekbench-test"><u>Geekbench</u></a>. With this, we learned that it’s powered by the Snadpragon 8 Elite and is paired with 12GB of RAM.</p><p>As for the results, the Galaxy S25 Slim achieved a single-core score of 3005 and a multi-core score of 6945. What makes this interesting is that the single-core score lines up with other leaked S25 benchmarks. However, the multi-core score falls a bit flat, leading to speculation about whether this will actually be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite “for Galaxy” or if there’s something else going on.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smart rings took the tech world by storm last year, but they're still relatively niche in terms of global sales. Samsung aside, most smart ring brands are fledgling startups, all trying to make a name for themselves in a Wild West industry. There's no template for the "right" way to make smart rings.</p><p>So it's no surprise that we saw a wide range of smart ring solutions at CES 2025, showing brands like Ultrahuman, Circular, and Evie throwing their darts at the board and seeing what will stick with consumers.</p><p>We interviewed several smart ring CEOs around CES, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-ceo-tom-hale-interview">Oura's Tom Hale</a>, and got some valuable insights into how they hope to rebrand smart rings, whether it be medical tracking, AI insights, or luxury jewelry. And it'll be fascinating to see which angle pays off.</p>
<h2 id="proactive-ai-insights-into-bodily-trends-2">Proactive AI insights into bodily trends</h2>
<p>Smart rings collect a ton of information on your sleep quality and heart rate, with generic explanations for why you might get a bad score. Movano Health, which sells the petite Evie smart ring for women, is looking to use "EvieAI" to improve the actionable insights you get from your data.</p><p>Announced at CES 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/movano-health-launches-evieai-virtual-wellness-assistant-302344841.html">EvieAI Virtual Wellness Assistant</a> "generates clear and concise answers based on articles that have been published in over 100,000 medical journals...to interpret complex user queries about almost any symptom, disease, condition, or procedure."</p><p>CEO John Mastrototaro, whom we interviewed about the announcement, explained that because the AI can "only respond with what it knows" from "validated medical information," cross-references with sources like Mayo Clinic for the best answers — while ignoring any non-medical questions.</p><p>He also promised that your questions will remain private, with no information sent back to Movano Health to be sold to advertisers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LfgbVBDBkvtudBtXo9HrA" name="EvieAI-beta-conversation-example" alt="Three phone screenshots showing a hypothetical conversation with the EvieAI beta chatbot about a woman's perimenopausal symptoms." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LfgbVBDBkvtudBtXo9HrA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Movano Health)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this initial version of EvieAI is a more generic kind of chatbot search engine for medical info, the company promises that future EvieAI responses will be "personalized based on users' own health metrics, including heart rate, blood oxygen, menstrual cycle information, skin temperature variability, sleep, exercise, and mood."</p><p>This is something that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> can already do to some extent with its AI chatbot, and it's that version of EvieAI that sounds the most promising for the future of smart rings, where an AI is "looking at all that data, and if it sees something changing in your trends...it could bring that to your attention," explained Mastrototaro.</p><p>Many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> call attention to negative trends, but a medically-focused AI chatbot could, in theory, provide more personalized and specialized insights into that data than what's currently available. Whether EvieAI can deliver "99.9% accurate" data on the strength of its sources, as Mastrototaro suggests, will be worth investigating.</p>
<h2 id="transitioning-from-wellness-to-health-tracking-2">Transitioning from 'wellness' to 'health' tracking</h2>
<p>One of the biggest CES smart ring announcements was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Circular Ring 2</a>. While the original Circular Ring was thin and flat-edged with a relatively short battery life, the Ring 2 has a more traditional rounded ring shape, an 8-day battery life, and an "FDA-approved" ECG sensor to actively detect possible AFib, tachycardia, and brachycardia.</p><p>"All of these [smart ring] brands compete for something very similar, and it's very hard for consumers to differentiate when we're all offering the same thing," explained Circular CEO Amaury Kosman during a CES interview. Transitioning from traditional "wellness" features like sleep and stress to actual health and medical information is how they plan to stand out from the crowd and attract B2B sales.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9w2htTFGLvveCDTcoEyPWi" name="Circular-Ring-2-press-photo-rose-gold" alt="A press photo of the rose gold Circular Ring 2 sitting on a rose petal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9w2htTFGLvveCDTcoEyPWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Circular)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Adding the ECG meant abandoning Circular's trademark haptics for notifications and alarms, but Kosman sees medical accuracy as the priority until they can fit both in one ring.</p><p>Circular wants to turn its smart rings into an at-home alternative for "expensive" and "invasive" medical checks at the doctor's office, giving you actionable information so you're armed with knowledge <em>before</em> you go to the doctor. ECGs are the start, Kosman says, with future features like "blood pressure" and passive AFib detection being worked on.</p><p>While many smartwatches have FDA-approved AFib detection, most stop there, only promising a "wellness" check-in area like blood oxygen. Smart rings, which can promise a more exact fit on your finger, seem to be pivoting to deliver FDA approval in more areas; case in point, Movano Health got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/movano-health-receives-fda-clearance-for-eviemed-ring-302319677.html">FDA approval for its pulse oximeter</a> last December. Mastrototano, too, promises the Evie Ring will be a "clinical-grade device for B2B channels."</p><p>In other words, even if consumers only see smart rings as a niche novelty for now, that might change if doctors recommend at-risk patients buy smart rings for accurate monitoring in place of more expensive and cumbersome equipment. Medical companies have considerably more reach and marketing than these small smart ring startups; if they get invested in rings, that could change public perception of them.</p>
<h2 id="attracting-the-luxury-crowd-2">Attracting the luxury crowd</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DFzyJyWurTpCRkvsgARD5c" name="Ultrahuman-Rare-Desert-Rose-press-photo" alt="A photo of a model masked in shadow with her hand stylistically lit, highlighting the Ultrahuman Rare Desert Rose smart ring on her index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFzyJyWurTpCRkvsgARD5c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultrahuman took yet another rebranding tack at CES when it announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-rare-luxury-smart-ring-with-premium-materials-massive-price">Ultrahuman Rare</a>. It's a £1,499 smart ring made of either 18k gold or 95% platinum, while still offering the same health and fitness tools as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>.</p><p>"What sets the Rare apart...is the complex engineering that goes into making a robust yet aesthetic form factor out of gold, platinum, and rose gold," Ultrahuman explained in its announcement.</p><p>Ultrahuman isn't a skin-deep kind of company; it announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">PowerPlugs</a> last year as a way to expand what the Ring Air can track, and in 2025 revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/blood-vision/">Blood Vision</a> gambit to connect your ring wellness data with your blood markers for more exact information. So, its way forward isn't <em>just</em> about turning smart rings into attractive jewelry.</p><p>Still, even if the Ultrahuman Rare has very limited sales, we see aesthetics as a vital path forward for smart rings, as they all tend to be so thick and similar to one another. They stand out compared to the skinny, rounded rings that most people wear, and that can limit their reach with consumers.</p><p>This shows that if smart ring brands go beyond the tech space and make them seem attractive luxury items to mainstream consumers, that could be yet another path for them to grow beyond their current niche. Jewelers and department stores have far more advertising reach and clout than little-known tech brands.</p>

<hr>
<p>TikTok is officially shutting down in the U.S. The app is banned as of Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025, when a law enacting the ban will take effect. Multiple pop-up messages began appearing for users of the TikTok app for Android in the U.S. throughout the night of Saturday, Jan. 18, just ahead of the impending ban. While the latest message forces TikTok to become completely unavailable, it does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-can-save-tiktok-from-united-states-ban">give hope that service could be restored quickly</a>.</p><p>"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now," the latest message reads, as shown in a screenshot that appeared for Android Central below. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now."</p><p>Over the last few days, there have been reports concerning how the TikTok ban would be impacted by the looming transition of presidential power in the U.S. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden declined to enforce the ban, as reported by multiple outlets, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/17/tiktok-ban-biden-wont-enforce-decision-trump/77773281007/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>. That leaves the fate of the TikTok ban in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in on Monday, Jan. 20.</p><p>Recent reports have indicated that Trump will consider giving TikTok an extension in the hopes that it will sell the U.S. part of its business. Lawmakers in the country have maintained that their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">preference is to divest TikTok from ByteDance</a>, not shut it down. They argue that TikTok's current ownership poses a national security threat because Chinese laws could theoretically force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data to the government if requested.</p>

<p>The most recent notification hints at which way Trump may be leaning. "We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office," the notification reads. "Please stay tuned!"</p><p>For now, the notification provides buttons for <strong>Learn more</strong> and <strong>Close app</strong>. TikTok is officially offline for U.S. users and will stay that way until, if, and when the company and the federal government can figure out a way to move forward. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/oracle-prepares-to-start-shutting-tiktok-servers-saturday-night" target="_blank">The Information</a>, TikTok's U.S. cloud servers are hosted by Oracle, which will keep the platform's servers powered down until it is definitively clear that it is lawfully permitted to operate in the country.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Look, there's no shortage of choices if you're looking to upgrade your earbuds, and there's a new option that's intriguing. Korea-based Astell&Kern launched the AK UW100MKII at the end of 2023, and they're now making their way to India. The lengthy wait comes with a distinct advantage though, as the earbuds are now being sold at a massive discount. <br><br>While the earbuds debuted for $299, they're now on sale in India for just ₹4,999 ($58) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.headphonezone.in/products/astell-kern-ak-uw100mkii">at Headphone Zone</a>, and that's a stellar value. Astell&Kern don't sell the UW100MKII in other regions any longer, so it's entirely likely that the brand is moving unsold inventory to India and offering it at a discount.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nVHWfonYfLgP4PQVasYXgU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVHWfonYfLgP4PQVasYXgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of the reason, the UW100MKII are among the most intriguing earbuds in the budget category, and the focus on high-resolution sound combined with a great built-in DAC allow it to stand out. The design is distinctive in its own right; the UW100MKII come in a rather bulky case with a hexagonal design, and while it is still pocketable, it is much bigger than what you get with most mainstream audio brands. <br><br>It's not just the case that's bulky either — the UW100MKII have a sizeable shell that makes them bigger than just about every other earbuds I used recently. You get a hexagonal design on the face plate as well, alongside a stylized AK logo. The brand says it redesigned the sound chamber to deliver a cleaner sound, and while that is evident when using the earbuds, they protrude from the ear quite a bit.</p>

<p>The bulky design means I never quite got a decent fit, and even doing routine tasks like walking around the house doing chores led to an earbud dislodging. Clearly, these aren't meant for exercising, so if you need a new pair of earbuds that you can take to the gym, these aren't it. There is IPX4 ingress protection, but the issues with the fit prevent the UW100MKII from bring usable in this regard. <br><br>You miss out on ANC as well, and that's understandable when you consider the context of where these earbuds are meant to be used. The fit means that these are meant to be used indoors, and I wouldn't recommend using them while traveling, much less involving any activity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PXBPCNTm6MuE7YqnY4fDcU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXBPCNTm6MuE7YqnY4fDcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for connectivity, the earbuds use Bluetooth 5.2, and you get fast pair, giving you the ability to link the buds with your Google account, making it a breeze to connect when switching devices — as I do often. The standout addition is AptX Adaptive; it allows you to stream high-res music over Bluetooth, and it's a welcome inclusion.<br><br>The UW100MKII include a Knowles balanced armature driver, so if you've used IEMs that had these drivers in the past, you'll be familiar with the sound signature. It's clear that Astell&Kern wanted to deliver a neutral sound without exaggerating any part of the frequency, and that makes the UW100MKII sound quite different to just about every other option around. You also get an AKM AK4332ECB DAC, and it is a great pairing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ETmcuc6qFrC9yWLJQ3Y9oU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETmcuc6qFrC9yWLJQ3Y9oU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the sound, the bass is limited, and you just don't get the same level of energy as other earbuds in this category. The defining characteristic of most wireless earbuds is a rumbling bass that lends itself well to diverse genres, and the UW100MKII miss out on that — the tuning is in line with what you get on IEMs, and while you don't get the same vibrancy, there is good resolution. <br><br>The UW100MKII deliver clean mids with a good vocal presentation, and the treble has decent extension without sibilance. There's no distortion or hiss, and I didn't have any issues with the soundstage after a month of use. The AK Control app is available on Android (you need to have a device with Android 15), and it lets you tweak the sound profile, adjust the DAC settings, and tune ambient noise control. I didn't see any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EuHVPbcBM4vLddrDfZmppU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EuHVPbcBM4vLddrDfZmppU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a bass-focused mode that adds a little bit of exuberance to the low-end, but it isn't on the same level as most earbuds. That said, when it comes to the technicalities of the sound itself, the UW100MKII do a fantastic job. I didn't see any issues with battery life either, with the earbuds managing to last six hours between charges. While I didn't have issues with connectivity, the right earbud didn't always sit flush in the case, so it ended up running out of charge earlier. <br><br>So should you buy these earbuds? If you need a sound signature that's similar to IEMs and want a neutral tuning, then yes, the UW100MKII are a good choice. But if you need an easier fit, better bass, and water resistance, I'd recommend getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> instead.</p>

But a busy 2024 full of more exciting smartwatch and ring tech made the subtle ScanWatch fall to the wayside.</p><p>As fans of Withings products, though, we wanted to give the ScanWatch 2 a fair shake, so we finally made a point of testing the watch throughout December and early January.</p><p>Does the Withings ScanWatch 2 have what it takes to keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-hybrid-smartwatches">hybrid smartwatches</a> relevant, or will consumers move on to smart rings for even more subtle health tracking? Based on our time testing the ScanWatch 2, your impression of it will truly come down to whether you care more about style or substance.</p>

<p>The Withings ScanWatch 2 comes in 38mm and 42mm case sizes. Both ship in Black or Pearl White, while only the 38mm has Blue and Sand color options. All of them ship with a fluoroelastomer band; Withings sells other Leather, Premium Sport, and Metal options that cost anywhere from $39 to $89 each.</p><p>All Withings ScanWatch 2 models cost $349.95. It comes with a three-month subscription to Withings Plus, which shows a Health Improvement Score, Cardio Check-Up, and unique recipes and workouts. After the free trial, it costs $9.95/month or $99.95/year.</p><p>Withings has also released the ScanWatch Brilliant and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-announced">ScanWatch Nova</a> for $599; both are essentially classier siblings of the ScanWatch 2. They have the same HealthSense Gen 3 sensor suite, stainless steel 316L case, 0.63-inch OLED cutout display, prolonged battery life, and general health, sleep, and activity insights. The Nova has 10ATM resistance and a better anti-reflective coating for water sports, while the Brilliant has a Titanium bezel and special steel hands.</p><p>Since you're looking at a hybrid watch for style over smarts, you may choose the Brilliant or Nova over the default ScanWatch 2, knowing the experience we outline below will be the same for you.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-withings-scanwatch-2-what-we-liked"><span>Withings ScanWatch 2: What we liked</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NyMZUYpUaCoF2JbVbyTRum" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-1" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 on a wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NyMZUYpUaCoF2JbVbyTRum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Off the bat, this is a gorgeous watch. The circular stainless steel case and sapphire glass give the watch a timeless look, one that many smartwatches try to emulate with varying success. Of course, a big part of this is the fact that this is mostly a standard watch with no touch screen, physical watch hands, and a rotating crown (more on that later). Anyone looking at the ScanWatch 2 wouldn’t think that this does anything but tell time.</p><p>I’ve actually gotten quite a few compliments on the watch, something that rarely happens when I wear my admittedly very good-looking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> or even a Galaxy Watch. And when Michael showed non-techy family members over a dozen smartwatches over the holidays, nearly all of them picked the ScanWatch 2 as their favorite, with some saying it's the only one they'd ever wear.</p><p>Unlike a "normal" watch, the ScanWatch 2 has a small circular cutout at the top for a basic, monocolor display. Given its small size, interactions are quite limited, but Withings does a fairly good job of keeping things concise enough to discern individual settings.</p><p>Watch hands cover up the display depending on the time, but since there's no always-on display setting, it doesn't matter; the hands automatically move aside if you interact with the crown to scroll through the menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="x2pVAYxwd6syDuRZbh3F8k" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-7" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 in hand with the display on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2pVAYxwd6syDuRZbh3F8k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3807" height="2141" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the best part about using the display is the haptic feedback you get when you scroll to another option. It’s quite subtle, but it makes me think about the haptics on the Pixel Watch 3 and reminds me just how important good haptics are.</p><p>Cycling through the menu presents you with up to 14 customizable options, which can be changed in the app. This includes steps, body temperature, ECG, SpO2, and more. Given how small the display is, Withings makes it so that you don’t have to interact with various levels of submenus in each option, which works in its favor. In fact, only a few options have submenus, with most just there to display data like steps or heart rate without you needing to do anything.</p><p>You also have the option to set a shortcut when you press and hold the crown, which I like to set to workouts since it’s about the only thing I do with the ScanWatch 2 aside from checking the time. Anything especially complicated is relegated to the app, with the extra screen space and easier controls.</p>

<p>This is not a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> by any means. There are some workout options in the watch, which you can also customize in the app, but the Withings ScanWatch 2 is more of a passive health watch than anything, with automatic workout detection for a few mainstream activities and manual workout starts in the app. And it requires your phone on hand for connected GPS.</p><p>After a run, Withings will show an interesting baseline of data, including distance, pace, calories, elevation, heart rate zones, body temperature changes, and temp zones. The last two are especially rare, outside of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-body-temperature-sensor-thermal-load">expensive body temp sensors</a>, giving you a unique look at your level of effort.</p><p>There's a lot of missing data for athletes that we'll discuss in the next section, but at the very least, the heart rate average is fairly accurate for normal workouts, coming within 1 bpm of a heart rate strap during a run. During another run, it randomly showed a heart rate of 30 bpm above Michael's actual rate for a couple of minutes at the start but then auto-corrected to the correct rate.</p>

<p>The ScanWatch 2's main function — aside from health tracking and basic fitness — is to show phone notifications. Withings lets you customize which apps can buzz your wrist, which fits with the hybrid smartwatch theme of limiting them to important information. The display is activated by gesture and is subtle enough that you'll look as if you're just checking the time.</p><p>Notifications show a tiny app icon with the text flowing quickly underneath in a single-file line; the speed is important so you're not stuck standing there for too long, waiting for information that would all show instantly on a full-screen AMOLED. You can see in the photos above how the Slack notification "Derrek Lee: Sure thing, how's this?" would require at least three photos to show all the text. Thankfully, notifications scroll past multiple times in case you miss anything.</p><p>If you receive multiple messages from the same app, the ScanWatch 2 gives up and shows the app icon and nothing else. While you might wish for more information, it's kind of an effective way of telling the user they've already missed information and should pull out their phone.</p>

<p>The Withings app experience is about as simple as the watch itself. It uses the same app as Withings’ other products, meaning you can manage all your devices in one space, something that comes in handy. I like that I can view my steps and activities in the same place as the weight measurement data from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/withings-body-cardio-review">Withings Body Cardio</a> scale, giving me a more comprehensive view of my health from within the same family of devices. Any blank spots can be filled by other devices via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> or individual app connections to partner apps like Google Fit, MyFitnessPal, Strava, and more.</p><p>If you're picking up the ScanWatch 2, then you'll love its battery life. Withings says the watch should last up to 30 days on a single charge, which feels accurate. I haven’t been able to reach that mark only because I track multiple workouts per week while wearing the watch. Still, I average two or three weeks on a single charge, and I often forget that I even need to charge the watch. Even when the battery reaches 0%, it’ll still be able to track your sleep and steps for some time, which is pretty great.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4hfPJZkEe46o3FFwnb2vH5" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-settings" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 on the author's wrist, showing the Settings menu on the small OLED screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hfPJZkEe46o3FFwnb2vH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Withings ScanWatch 2 is trying to be as passive as possible, which is understandable given its small display. Other hybrid watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a> give you much more display space for clearer information but also tend to be much shorter-lived. Withings prioritizes battery life and subtlety, but it does limit the smarts.</p><p>While the watch keeps menus basic, navigation can still be a bit of a pain, especially when you have most of the menu options enabled. I often find myself scrolling for longer than I would like to get to a specific menu option, and if you want to exit out of a submenu, you’ll have to scroll all the way up and select the back button, which just feels cumbersome.</p><p>Additionally, if you’re in a submenu and go a short period without interacting with the display, it’ll go back to the clock face. You’ll need to use the app to cut some unnecessary options and minimize scrolling.</p><p>While you're at it, you may also want to use this time to manage your notifications, as the ScanWatch 2 is pretty hit-or-miss when it comes to displaying them. Sometimes, the watch misses them entirely; other times, it only shows them after I've already opened the message on my phone, which defeats the purpose.</p><p>While I love the subtle crown haptics, Withings cranked up the vibration for notifications and phone calls to a rather shocking level. It's frankly annoying, to the point that I often leave the watch in Do Not Disturb. Wear OS and Apple Watches let you adjust the vibration strength, but Withings' setting menu is a bit too barebones. At least you never have to worry about sleeping through an alarm!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-3" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open to a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I said previously, the ScanWatch 2 isn’t really a fitness watch, which is pretty evident by its design. So, while you’ll get some workout options to choose from, some that I would frequently use just aren’t there, leaving me to have to choose “Other” or “Fitness” when I’m doing something fairly common, like HIIT. There are still plenty of workout options available, but that one is an annoying omission for me.</p><p>As for the more common workout options like running, you miss out on data that's common on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watches</a> like running form, running power, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a>. Its heart rate data lacks subtlety, too, lumping most of your effort into either "moderate" or "intense."</p><p>I also don’t like that there isn’t a way to export my individual workout data, at least not in any way that’s obvious to me. Sure, I can edit workout data like the type, intensity, and duration, but once it’s logged, the only way I can share it is via an image, which is essentially a screenshot of the workout summary. Syncing the app with Strava also doesn't help, as it only shares the workout type and duration, while my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> will provide heart rate data, location, and just about everything I would want to include in a workout summary.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XhvKNFDMJ7YA2gxoDu3cM5" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-ECG" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 on the author's wrist, showing the ECG widget on the small OLED screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhvKNFDMJ7YA2gxoDu3cM5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Withings ScanWatch 2 has a fairly comprehensive list of health metrics that it tracks, from heart health and blood oxygen to menstrual cycle phases. It also has a few features — overnight HRV, respiratory rate, and awake temperature zones — that are <em>still</em> "coming soon," even though we delayed our review for so long.</p><p>More importantly, I’m not crazy about the sleep tracking. To start, the ScanWatch 2 isn't the lightest watch on the block, with the 42mm size weighing nearly as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. This makes it rather uncomfortable to wear to bed, something we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">find with most smartwatches</a> but is particularly troublesome with the ScanWatch 2.</p><p>Sometimes, the watch will be pretty decent, but oftentimes, it will omit large portions of my sleep. I tend to wake up in the middle of the night, and I’ll get up for a minute or two to use the restroom or grab a drink before falling back asleep. While my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> will continue to track my sleep, the ScanWatch 2 will seemingly miss hours' worth of sleep tracking, which puzzles me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wGmFutBDrLW6zzSbrGNKpm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-4" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGmFutBDrLW6zzSbrGNKpm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, the app seemingly prioritizes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> sleep data over the ScanWatch data, which I find odd. The plus side is that the data is from my Oura Ring 4, so at least it’s logging the more accurate data, but it’s still interesting that Withings wouldn’t prioritize its own device over outside data.</p><p>Speaking of the app, Withings really wants you to buy into its Withings Plus subscription, which will provide things like a Health improvement score, a library of workouts and recipes with recommended daily missions, and health insights that let you view your trends. While I’m not fully against subscriptions, Withings Plus just doesn’t feel quite worth the $9.95 monthly price tag, especially when Oura’s is only $5.99 per month and other smartwatch OEMs don’t require a subscription at all for this data. Make it make sense, Withings!</p><p>It’s also a good thing the ScanWatch 2 has such a long battery life because the rather cumbersome charger takes about two hours to fully recharge the watch.</p>

<p>Choosing a hybrid watch comes down to your personal preferences on style and how much health info or fitness tech you want out of your watch.</p><p>If you really only need the <em>basics</em> of health data to go with your notifications, the Withings ScanWatch Light will save you $100 compared to the ScanWatch 2. In exchange, you lose ECGs, skin temperature, elevation tracking, and blood oxygen, while keeping a similar steel design and dependable battery life.</p><p>Garmin makes popular hybrid or fashion models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Vivomove Trend</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-crossover-review">Instinct Crossover</a>, and Lily 2 that give you data like heart rate, stress, and blood oxygen, along with connected GPS and useful training insights without a subscription. Only the Vivomove series is truly "stylish" in our books, and it has much shorter battery life than the ScanWatch 2, plus no ECG or skin temperature; we do appreciate that its grayscale screen is a little larger, so it displays more information. The Instinct Crossover will appeal to fans of rugged Casio-type watches, not classic watches.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's hard to find any <em>smarter</em> hybrid watches with better notifications or apps than Withings or Garmin. Fossil made decent hybrid models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-hybrid-wellness-edition-review">Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition</a>, but Fossil has abandoned the platform. Citizen still sells the CZ Smart Hybrid with Wear OS 3, but we haven't tested it for ourselves and it's unlikely Citizen will ever update to the later versions.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a classy-looking "smartwatch."</li><li>You want a "smartwatch" with minimal distractions.</li><li>You want basic health and fitness tracking.</li><li>You own a Withings scale and love the app already.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want comprehensive fitness tracking.</li><li>You're looking for a more traditional smartwatch experience with a touchscreen and full-screen interactions.</li><li>You don't own any other Withings products.</li></ul>
<p>There's no doubt that the ScanWatch 2 is a beautiful piece of hardware. While I like the look of the Pixel Watch 3, the ScanWatch 2 has a classic yet understated design that goes well with most outfits. Plus, with such a long battery life, it feels more like a regular watch with some smart tricks to keep you on top of your health and wellness.</p><p>However, as a hybrid smartwatch, I'm not sure the ScanWatch 2 quite hits the mark, feeling more "watch" than "smart." The minimal display keeps things rather passive, which buyers may prefer, but interacting with the watch can be cumbersome at worst and unreliable at best. Unless you are subscribed to Withings Plus or own any other Withings devices, the watch may leave you wanting more out of your data, including the type of insights you can find on other devices for less money or even free.</p><p>If the ScanWatch 2 was priced about $50-$100 less, I would maybe recommend getting one. But right now, it doesn't really do much to move hybrid smartwatches forward in any meaningful way, and you'd be better off spending your $349 on the latest Pixel Watch or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> if you want passive tracking.</p><p>That said, both Michael and I skew much more towards the "tech" and "fitness" side of smartwatches, which skews our perspective on what we want.

<p>I was recently asked to give some reasons why someone might want to move from iOS to Android, under the pretense that this hypothetical person hadn't used Android in over 10 years. After sitting and thinking about it for a little while, I provided my responses, but I also came away with a burning question — Is AI really the last frontier?</p><p>It's a question that's been rattling around in my head for the better part of the past year, as I've watched Google, Samsung, Apple, OnePlus, and others, try to find the right balance. OpenAI's ChatGPT is really to blame after it exploded onto the scene <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">back in late 2022</a>. It became so popular so quickly that it forced Google's hand to the point that Gemini was originally called Bard. Like, for months, before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-bard-gemini-rebrand-app-launch">making the correct decision</a> to rebrand it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tndmX2quZgmwDNi5F6GGnn" name="google-bard-pixel-7-pro-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-1.jpg" alt="Google Bard interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tndmX2quZgmwDNi5F6GGnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, Apple threw in the towel and just integrated ChatGPT into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone</a>, and it still doesn't do anything to make Siri any better. Samsung's partnership with Google is paying off, as it is leaning heavily on Gemini for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> integrations. Even OnePlus got in the game, also relying on a combination of its own in-house developed AI models, along with Gemini Nano on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>All of this sounds great, truly. But what can possibly be next?</p><p>There's not much else that can be done in the way of design innovation. We already have flippable clamshells, book-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a>, and even bi-folds that everyone is calling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">tri-folds</a>. And while rollable phones haven't really hit the market yet, they might not be far off, as Lenovo announced a rollable laptop that's actually being released later this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yvjEqEdx6PbRkoqY8FkXnk" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvjEqEdx6PbRkoqY8FkXnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android is no longer playing catchup to iOS, at least in most regards, and one could even argue that Android is the better platform for everyone. Do you want to tinker? Use Android. Want to keep things simple? Get a Pixel. Looking to replicate the Apple ecosystem? Look no further than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung</a>.</p><p>While I could definitely sit here and nitpick about things on both iOS and Android, that's kind of the point. They're only nitpicks. The landscape is nothing like it used to be, as there's quite a bit of feature parity between the two platforms. No, it's not synchronous, but the days of not being able to perform even the most basic of tasks on one and not the other have disappeared from the rearview mirror.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-03" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So what can possibly be next? I honestly don't think the answer actually lies within smartphones. If I were to make a non-educated guess, the "Next Big Thing" wouldn't actually have anything to do with a smartphone. I think we're heading in a completely different direction, and the most likely end result is going to be a wearable like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta's Ray Ban Smart Glasses</a>.</p><p>Maybe it won't be those specifically, but it has to be something in that ballpark. At the same time, I don't think it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">virtual reality</a>, at least not in our day-to-day lives. Maybe VR overtakes console gaming or something, but seeing how popular handhelds are becoming, I doubt even that happens.</p><p>As pointed out by Michael Hicks, Android Central's senior editor of Wearables & AR/VR, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-xr-will-need-to-emulate-wear-os-to-succeed">plenty of potential problems</a> that will need to be remedied with various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> headsets when they finally hit the market. These are similar issues to the ones that continue to affect smartwatches, such as "battery life, comfortable and stylish designs, accessible controls," amongst others.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG" name="android-xr-smart-glasses-concept-01" alt="A lifestyle image showing off a prototype pair of smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although Google and Samsung are getting a late jump compared to Meta, that's not necessarily a bad thing. With other companies already releasing options, this gives others the opportunity to learn what mistakes to avoid, in addition to having an idea of "what works" versus what doesn't.</p><p>However, unlike smartphones and other wearables, Android XR has the distinct and unique "advantage" of being the first new platform to arrive in the age of AI. We fully expect Gemini to be everywhere and anywhere that Google can put it, but I also wouldn't be surprised if its functionality is limited for the first year or two.</p><p>This is simply because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> have a limited physical space, and will have a multitude of various sensors and other necessary components just to work. Plus, new platforms and new devices usually mean higher prices as companies try to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-prototypes-2022">recoup the R&D costs</a> in addition to attempting to turn a profit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No, I don't believe that AI is the final frontier, but I do believe that we're at the "end of the line" in terms of avenues that can be explored in terms of hardware.</p><p>Nothing will be able to replicate or even replace the smartphone for many reasons, but mainly because your phone is the most personal device you have. This is partially why I think we're seeing companies shift focus to implementing AI into the software, as it <em>should</em> make our most personal devices even more personal.</p><p>So, while it may seem like AI is the <em>next</em> frontier, I do believe that there's still room for something new in terms of hardware. Now, it's just up to companies to figure out what that looks like and find ways to implement it in our daily lives.</p>

<h2 id="choose-only-the-best-oneplus-13r-screen-protectors-2">Choose only the best OnePlus 13R screen protectors</h2>
<p>The best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13r-cases">OnePlus 13R cases</a> sometimes come with screen protectors in the box. If you didn't get one, or maybe you were bold enough to forgo a case altogether, you need one of the best OnePlus 13R screen protectors. Screens crack and smash all the time, so better be safe than sorry.</p><p>Most OnePlus 13R screen guards are made of tempered glass, which is a good material for shatter-proofing your phone's display. However, flexible films are often better at scratch resistance as they can heal from minor abrasions. Not to mention, not all glass protectors work smoothly with in-display fingerprint readers. Luckily, this hasn't been reported as an issue by OnePlus 13R users so far.</p><p>Thus, you can rely on a kit like the Anoowkoa 2 Pack OnePlus 13R Screen Protectorto fortify your 13R's frontal region. The brand is very highly rated and its users are mostly satisfied with the quality of the tempered glass screen protectors. What makes it an even better deal overall is the fact that you get two glass camera lens protectors as well. Since these screen guards have undergone the oleophobic treatment, they repel solid and liquid particles such as water droplets, sweat, dust, and fingerprints.</p><p>And if you're really looking to make the most of your coin, take a gander at the Suttkue OnePlus 13R Screen Protector set which comes with a shock-proof clear case. Yes, that's right, the clear case has reinforced edges for high impact absorbtion. This, in addition to two robust 9H tempered glass pieced is an excellent bargain.</p>

<p>This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape.</p><p>The countdown to Samsung's Unpacked has begun, and in a week, we will see what this year's models look like. This week, Galaxy S25 leaks came in hot, we got a Moto G launch, the Galaxy Ring just received more updates, Honor Magic 7 Pro launched globally, and the new OnePlus models got their first update.</p>

<p><em><strong>More on these stories in the embedded links below.</strong></em></p><p>We all know too well that the week before a launch is crucial. However, this is also a time when we get to see a plethora of leaks. From device colors to AI powers, we got to see them all building the excitement for some or taking the mystery out for others.</p><p>Evan Blass has been putting out information about the Galaxy S25 series. In the first set of leaks, Blass reportedly sent an email carrying his newsletter, which contained renders of the Galaxy S25 and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-color-rendering-leak-surfaces" target="_blank"> its entire alleged color palette</a>. According to Blass, the S25 Ultra is set to receive four options such as black, white, grayish blue, and gray.</p><p>In another email, Blass sent alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-latest-galaxy-s25-leak-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-a-new-one-ui-7-feature-in-action" target="_blank">official promotional posters</a> from Samsung that painted a picture of how the cameras on these devices will likely appear. The first image shows the two devices, which seem to be the Galaxy<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25"> </a>S25 and S25 Plus models, in deep blue and silver color variants. The image gives us a close-up of the trio's cameras on the back, with black rims surrounding them.</p><p>Additionally, within the image, a new AI feature was spotted that is said to come with the One<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on"> </a>UI<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on"> </a>7. The screen displays an interactive bar at the bottom, dubbed “Now Bar,” with the “Now Brief” prompt visible that reads "Get today's highlight."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So... While everyone's focusing on devices I revealed 5 months ago, today, I'm once again well ahead of the hype by finally bringing you the very 1st look at the #GalaxyS25Slim (360° video + gorgeous 5K renders + dimensions)!😏On behalf of @Smartprix 👉🏻 https://t.co/FPZnEKqNuD pic.twitter.com/HSTloqzYj7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1879599398625374691">January 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Another device we got to see is the Galaxy S25 Slim. We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">got a glimpse at renders </a>of the assumed device that were discovered by OnLeaks. The images suggest the device will look a lot like the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus, with rumors suggesting a size closer to the Plus and Ultra with a completely flat display.</p><p>The leaker suggests that the Galaxy S25 Slim will be roughly "1.6mm narrower, 3.8mm shorter, and 1.8mm thinner" than the upcoming S25 Ultra. There are claims that the phone will have the same camera setup as the S25 phones—three cameras: a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 50MP ALoP telephoto camera with 3.5x zoom.</p><p>To know more about what to expect at this January's Unpacked event, head to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">our ultimate guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This week, Motorola launched its first pair of budget devices for 2025—the Moto G Power 2025 and Moto G 2025 (now omitting the "5G" from their names).</p><p>Talking about the Moto G Power's design, it comes with a vegan leather back that covers the 50MP triple camera array. The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, with 8GB of RAM on board. The phone also gets the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box with features like audio sharing and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a>.</p><p>The device gets a 5,000mAh battery, which Motorola says will enable all-day battery life. The Power 2025 also comes with an 8MP ultrawide camera. What's surprising is that this time, Motorola has managed to achieve the MIL-STD-810H certification and IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13,</a> in its $299 device. This means the phone can withstand being submerged and should be able to hold out when facing high-pressure water jets. The Moto G Power 2025 comes in Slate Gray and  Leaf Green colorways.</p><p>The other model, the Moto G 2025, features a smaller 6.7-inch display and the same Dimensity 6300 chipset. The difference between this and the Power 2025 is the lower 4 or 6GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of expandable storage (compared to 256GB). The device sports a 2MP macro sensor. The Moto G 2025 gets a 5,000mAh battery and upgraded charging speeds up to 30W when compared to its predecessor. This device is set to come in two colors: Forest Gray and Sapphire Blue.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> now comes in sizes 5-15, adding two larger sizes to its existing ones—14 & 15, in all three colorways, including silver, gold, and black, and will debut on January 22, 2025, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">upcoming Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>It is also bringing new features to the ring, to start, the mindfulness tracker will be available in the Samsung Health app soon. The new mindfulness section of the app will show a calendar with easy-to-understand, color-coded faces that summarize each day's mood, breathing, and stress levels.</p><p>In the first half of 2025, Samsung will add a new sleep environment report that will use SmartThings-connected devices to add temperature, humidity, air quality, and light intensity to your morning sleep report. Later in the second half of 2025, it will bring another update to the Galaxy Ring that will suggest optimal bedtime and wake-up time based on collected sleep patterns, habits, and conditions.</p><p>Samsung is also expanding its availability in 16 new countries, including Cyprus, Czech, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Zambia.</p>

The brand's high-end flagship is different from the China model that debuted in November 2024. The E.U. model of the Magic 7 Pro has a  6.8-inch screen that comes with a "Natural Light HONOR AI Eye Comfort Display." It uses the same battery technology with a smaller 5,270mAh capacity. The device has third-gen silicon-carbon batteries that provide higher capacities in smaller sizes, allowing the Magic 7 Pro to measure 8.8mm thick. The Honor Magic 7 Pro comes with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor.</p><p>When it comes to the camera array, the main Honor Magic 7 Pro camera is a 50MP, f/1.4 to f/2.0 adjustable aperture sensor with optical image stabilization. There's a 200MP periscope telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and a 50MP wide camera with a 122-degree field-of-view. When it comes to the selfie camera, it sports a 50MP wide camera.</p><p>It's also a very tough phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">as Honor demonstrated</a> by preparing food on the phone, sticking it in a dishwasher, dropping it out of a moving ATV, and then running it over with said ATV.</p><p>The Magic 7 Pro will be available in the U.K. starting at £1,099.99 and in the rest of Europe for €1,299.99.</p>

The shots taken through both handsets' primary camera and telephoto will start looking better, with color enhancements coming in with the update. The OnePlus 13 and the 13R have a Touch-to-share feature, which now supports iOS devices, making file and photo sharing easier between phones.</p><p>That said, the company says this update is being rolled out in batches, and users could expect to see the update as early as this weekend.</p>

We know the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank">Galaxy S25</a> is coming, and that usually means three models ranging from regular to Ultra, but there are also some other variants said to be locked behind some Samsung secret vault.</p><p>One of them is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">Galaxy S25 Slim</a>. It appears to be a "regular"-sized Galaxy S25 that's been put on a diet to slim down even more than the already slim Galaxy S25. What? Why?</p>

<p>A phone is actually a very personal item. It's part fashion choice, part utility, and part comfort. You want a phone that is easy to use, does the things you need it to do, and looks good. We all do.</p><p>With Android, there are thousands of different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones to choose from,</a> so you can find the one that's best for you. I want something easy to carry, cheap, and great at the things I call "smartphone basics," like messaging, email, and organization. I chose a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> and am completely satisfied with it.</p><p>You may want something to play games, has a ton of storage, or comes with a stylus. Go for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-rumored-low-light-video-improvements">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and never look back.</p><p>Both of us will find what we need.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are people out there who think 7mm is too thick and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">want a slimmer phone</a>. I don't know why, but I know those people exist. What I am sure of is that even those people aren't willing to make the compromises to get it with the current state of phone-making technology and they will realize it once they buy into it.</p><p>Until things are miniaturized even more, you have to sacrifice two very important things to get a phone extra slim: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery capacity</a> and durability. Both those things are pretty important.</p><p>Samsung will probably be able to decrease the camera bump with its new prism/lens tech; it places the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed" target="_blank">lenses on the prism</a> instead of in a separate space, making the whole thing shorter, and it is a pretty big deal we will see other phone makers use.</p><p>But that's not going to shave off the thickness of the phone itself. You need room to sandwich a screen assembly, a mainboard, and a battery inside the frame. Current tech isn't going to allow for a thinner screen combo or a thinner board so that means the only thing that can be made smaller is the battery. Smaller batteries mean less time away from the charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uwjEVyVvrLeTypb7EBkpMF" name="google-pixel-9-45w-charger-01.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwjEVyVvrLeTypb7EBkpMF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a million excuses why less battery capacity is fine. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wireless-fast-charging-differences-explained">charges really fast</a> or you can carry around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nivrana-battery-pack-oculus-quest-review">a battery pack</a> are examples. I'm here to tell you that those excuses stink and you shouldn't believe them because I used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review">Pixel 4</a> for a year. It was a great phone in almost every way — but the battery life sucked. Really sucked.</p><p>A slim phone will also be more fragile and have fewer means of cooling things down. You need room to move heat away from the processor package, and a thinner metal frame isn't as robust as a thicker one. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/post-bendgate-world-apples-word-still-good-enough-most">Bendgate</a> II, anyone?</p><p>In the end, it may not matter because the Galaxy S25 Slim is nothing more than a render. So far. If it <em>is</em> locked away at Samsung HQ waiting to be foisted on the buying public sometime later this year, think long and hard about the trade-off that comes with shaving a few millimeters off a modern smartphone.</p>

<p>Maybe you know exactly which color to buy when getting a new device, or maybe you spend days pondering over the right option. If you can relate to the latter, we're here to help. If not, good for you! This guide isn't for you.</p><p>Choosing which color of a phone to buy can be daunting, especially when you're going to using your expensive investment for a really long time. If you're too overwhelmed, Black Eclipse is a failsafe. However, I always encourage people to make brave decisions.</p><p>The blue vegan leather variant of the OnePlus 13 called Midnight Ocean is a fantastic way to reimagine what a phone's colorway should be. OnePlus didn't just change the coat of paint, but also the texture of this variant. It's the color of your standard pair of blue jeans, making it iconic. The superb leathery texture is hard to compare to the other two options of the OnePlus 13 that sport glass backs. Not only does it look spectacular, but it's also more scratch-resistant than the other options. You could probably use the Midnight Ocean version without a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13-cases">OnePlus 13 case</a>, considering the phone's robust ingress protection ratings.</p><p>If you do end up getting the Midnight Ocean variant, please get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13-screen-protectors">screen protector for your OnePlus 13</a>. The display is still made of glass and it's the most vulnerable part of your phone, so you need to reinforce it to keep it fresh in the long run.</p>

<p>All the best OnePlus 13R cases are priced below $20, with the one exception being OnePlus' own first-party phone cover. Despite the relatively high price, the OnePlus 13R Sandstone Magnetic Case is the best overall choice for your mid-range king.</p><p>OnePlus didn't add Qi2 wireless charging to the more affordable OnePlus 13R, but that doesn't mean you can't use magnetic accessories with it. With the OnePlus 13R Sandstone Magnetic Case, you add sleek drop protection as well as MagSafe or Qi2 support to your 13R, minus the wireless charging aspect. This means you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">magnetic add-ons</a> like stands, mounts, grips, holders, and more with the OnePlus 13R. It's definitely worth $25, especially when you take a closer look at that exquisite glittery sandstone finish of the phone cover.</p><p>Those who have a tighter budget can opt for most of the other cases and still be happy. If magnetism is what's important to you, the $13 NOUKAJU OnePlus 13R Magnetic Type Protective Case will be a more suitable pick. It's filthy cheap, has a MagSafe ring on the back, adds a frame for impact absorption, and has a semi-transparent back which looks pretty cool.</p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome is testing a new feature dubbed PermissionsAI behind a flag.</li><li>The new flag, when enabled, would showcase quieter browser permission notifications based on the user's previous browsing behavior.</li><li>To do so, it utilizes Chrome's Permission Predictions Services and also takes the help of Gemini Nano v2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Chrome already offers protection with AI to its users to ensure a safer browser experience. New findings indicate that AI will further be used for quieter browser permission notifications.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://windowsreport.com/google-chrome-to-use-ai-for-quieter-browser-permission-notifications/">WindowsReport</a>, the new permissions feature is currently being tested under a flag in Chrome Canary. The feature is seemingly dubbed "PermissionsAI," and it utilizes AI to predict the chances of a user granting certain permissions for a particular site based on their previous browsing behavior. In turn, it will showcase such requests in a quieter interface than the traditional ones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:756px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:17.20%;"><img id="t7vorZVmzk5BdpFJVt7nr8" name="google-chrome-permissionsAI-flag" alt="PermissionsAI flag on Chrome" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7vorZVmzk5BdpFJVt7nr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="756" height="130" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WindowsReport)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The respective flag description indicates that PermissionsAI would be utilizing the browser's Permission Predictions Service alongside Gemini Nano v2 to "surface permission requests using a quieter UI when the likelihood of the user granting the permission is predicted to be low."</p><p>The said feature also requires Google Chrome's "Safe browsing" feature to be enabled. It is still unclear how precisely it will work and can only be witnessed whenever the feature rolls out officially. As mentioned, it is currently available in the testing phase and not yet to the general public.</p>
<p>With quiet permission pop-ups, PermissionsAI will certainly be a nifty new addition to the Chrome browser, which has already incorporated Gemini AI in various parts, including the use of AI in history searches, organizing tabs, and the "Tab compare" feature. The aforementioned Safe browsing feature is also AI-powered.</p><p>Previous versions of Chrome Canary have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-canary-flag">indicated</a> that Chrome could soon use AI detection for scams and data siphons. This will supposedly leverage its on-device LLM to scan a website that the user is visiting for potential scams or chances that could put your data at risk of being stolen.</p><p>Another AI feature, Store Reviews, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-store-reviews-blurb-spotted">also spotted</a> in the works. It would summarize reviews from websites like TrustPilot for the products users intend to purchase.</p>

<hr>
<p>Another Galaxy S25 series leak seemingly points us toward a souped-up version of a recent Qualcomm chipset.</p><p>The recent string of rumors stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1880320175163195582">X tipster Arsène Lupin</a>, who posted a set of three specification images concerning the entire Galaxy S25 series. The most important part of this leak is the supposed existence of a "Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy" SoC. The rumor claims that this flagship chip variant is persistent across all three of the upcoming S25 phones.</p><p>This particular leak highlights the Galaxy S25 Ultra's 1TB variant, but it states it will receive 12GB of RAM with it.</p><p>It's a curious aspect of this leak, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-bump-up-ram-in-its-higher-end-models">that goes against</a> what's previously been rumored for the phone.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">25 pic.twitter.com/rW5EGZJbY9<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1880320175163195582">January 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Rumors of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-use-an-overclocked-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-in-the-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> cropped up at the top of 2025. The upcoming Ultra model was spotted moving through Geekbench 6 for its typical performance and clock speed tests. Interestingly, the database detailed that the chip the phone contained received lower scores than what's been tested in other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">8 Elite</a>-packed devices. However, what stood out was its clock speeds — those were a bit higher.</p><p>Per the listing, the S25 Ultra's speeds clocked in at 4.47GHz for two of its cores which normally have a speed of 4.32GHz. The rest of the chip's cores saw a speed of 3.53 GHz, which is in line with the recent chip's performance following launch.</p><p>The performance scores probably aren't something to sound the alarm over. Once again, the device in this Geekbench 6 listing had 12GB of RAM despite rumors claiming a 16GB version is possible. If true, it could mean that this overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy will see higher overall scores/performance.</p><p>Also, it <em>kind of </em>makes sense for Samsung to chase another "for Galaxy" chip variant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy">considering the Galaxy S24 had one</a>.</p><p>In other news, the specifications leaked by X tipster Lupin today (January 17) double down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">what recently surfaced</a>. A major Galaxy S25 spec leak might've told us everything we need to know about the series, like the Ultra model's 6.9-inch, WQHD resolution display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The phone's cameras were also on deck, with rumors suggesting users might see a 200MP primary camera, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will reportedly feature a 6.2-inch Full HD Plus display and a 6.7-inch WQHD resolution screen, respectively. The leak added that both phones will see the same triple camera array and boast a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series is preparing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">a January 22 debut</a>.

Running on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-pixel-9s-satellite-sos-runs-on-tech-from-skylo-and-garmin">technology from Skylo and Garmin</a>,  the feature works in the U.S. right now (with the exception of Hawaii and Alaska) and only with certain carriers.</p><p>It’s compatible with the Google Pixel 9 series, including the Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold models. If you have one of these devices, it can be an invaluable tool in the event of a real-life emergency.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up-emergency-sos-2">How to set up Emergency SOS</h2>
<p>The first thing you will want to do is set up emergency SOS on the device. This feature is available for most Android devices.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>setup</strong> at the bottom, right.</p>

<p>5. From here, you can change how to <strong>trigger Emergency SOS</strong> (touch and hold or wait for a five-second countdown), edit emergency SOS actions, add your emergency services number, and add emergency contacts.</p><p>6. Once you have adjusted settings to your liking, select <strong>Done</strong>. You can also try the demo if you want to confirm that it works and see how so you’re prepared should you ever need to actually invoke it.</p>

<p>Once Emergency SOS is set up, the steps for setting up and trying Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9 are largely the same.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Pixel Satellite SOS</strong>.</p>

<p>4. From there, you can <strong>edit the sharing preferences</strong> and <strong>demo Satellite SOS</strong> to get a walk-through of the process of how it works. This includes sending text messages to emergency response through the simulation of a situation in which you don’t have an active service connection.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in an emergency, here’s what to do. First, <strong>dial 9-1-1</strong>, and if the phone can’t connect, <strong>wait for the Satellite SOS icon</strong> to pop up and select it. Select <strong>Start</strong>, answer a few questions about the emergency (like you’re lost, trapped, or have come across someone else in need of emergency help), add details about the type of location (like a trail or a cave) and a timeline (how long have you been away?). You can also choose to notify the emergency contacts you have set up in the app by tapping <strong>Notify</strong> or selecting <strong>Don’t notify</strong> if you want to leave it to first responders.</p><p>The phone will show on-screen prompts to help you position your phone for the best signal to a satellite. Once connected, the phone will reach out to emergency services and share your information, and you should receive a reply within a few minutes. Stay on the line with emergency services if needed, or select <strong>End</strong> to end the session and wait for help to arrive. You can select “Yes, I still need help,” and emergency services will proceed with the call, even if you end it. If you have found a resolution, select “No, I don’t need help,” and the call will be canceled.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-to-know-about-satellite-sos-on-the-pixel-9-2">What else to know about Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9</h2>
<p>You don’t actually have to enable Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9. It automatically pops up when necessary and can contact emergency services for you. From there, you can proceed with the steps noted above, including describing the emergency in a short questionnaire and waiting for a reply from your local emergency services provider, which will hopefully send help your way.</p><p>Make sure to follow the prompts to correctly position your phone to get a proper satellite signal and remain outdoors with a clear view of the sky so the connection will work. You also need to have Google Messages set up as your default messaging app for the service to work. (If you don’t, or change it to another app, you will receive a message notifying you that Satellite SOS won’t be available unless you change it back).</p><p>It's worth noting that if someone were to pick up your phone, they would be able to see the lock screen message and your emergency information, even if the phone is locked. If you wish to turn this feature off, you can do so within the Personal Safety app. But considering this would only come up at a time when you might be in danger, you could probably use all the help you can get.</p><p>Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9 is free for the first two years. But after that, you will likely have to pay a subscription fee if you want to continue to have access to the feature. Nonetheless, set it up now and make use of the next 24 months of access to it.</p><p>There are a number of reasons the Google Pixel 9 is a worthwhile buy: we name the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> right now. Satellite SOS is a handy feature that could literally save your life, and it counts among the many ways this phone line-up is the best Google has to offer.</p>

<hr>
<p>A recent discovery suggests that Samsung will enhance its collaboration with Google on Android 15 to further its on-device AI assistance.</p><p>As highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1879905849520590896">Chunvn8888 on X</a>, Samsung might integrate several of its apps on Galaxy devices with Google's Gemini (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/stock-samsung-apps-one-ui-7-0-gemini-ai-integration/">SamMobile</a>). This integration seems to create a set of mini, Galaxy-exclusive Gemini extensions for Samsung's next software release as the AI could grab Calendar, Notes, and Reminders. For the former, the leak suggests Galaxy users could ask Gemini to "create, edit, or delete" events from their Samsung Calendars.</p><p>Another feature could leverage more of Gemini's intelligence as the rumored extension could "capture info from images to create events."</p><p>Regarding Samsung Notes, Gemini could accept commands to "create and summarize" entries, as well as surface stored data based on your description. The Reminders app extension will supposedly let Gemini create new ones for the user, per their request.</p><p>Editing privileges and a search function are rumored, as well.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pics description are pretty understandable so I just leave those here 🫡 pic.twitter.com/nlsvnkkWLC<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1879905849520590896">January 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The publication speculates these three extensions could arrive with Samsung's launch of One UI 7 (Android 15). Additionally, the X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1879964832428109874">mentioned</a> in their thread that there are "more" extensions than the three we've seen.</p><p><em>If </em>Samsung is preparing for a few Galaxy-exclusive Gemini extensions, it would make sense given the recent leaks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-promo-video-leak">involving AI experiences</a>. The leak involved a short teaser for Galaxy S25's reception of Gemini-backed assistance through One UI 7. Specifically, it showed how Google's AI could help the next wave of Galaxy phones with the Messages app.</p><p>Other AI-based features included "Audio Eraser" and the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-latest-galaxy-s25-leak-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-a-new-one-ui-7-feature-in-action">Now Bar</a>," which has been prominent in the beta.</p><p>The Now Bar is said to bring a little AI magic to the Galaxy S25's lock screen. The small icon at the bottom of the display will provide a "Now Brief" that brings the user highlights regarding sleep, travel information, music, and more. Samsung stated in a post that the lock screen's feature will leverage the user's most used apps for the briefing to ensure that you're never left out.</p><p>The AI will also provide "personalized" suggestions for what you should do next.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series is preparing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">debut on January 22</a>.

You get the outstanding power of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, plus a reliable two-day battery, 256GB of storage, and flagship-quality camera tech straight out of the box. It is, without a doubt, the best value for phones in this price range, and that&apos;s saying a lot, considering how many great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> are out there nowadays. </p><p>That being said, if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend skipping the 13R and going straight for the base model OnePlus 13. That device is likely to be the best Android phone released in 2025, with better hardware, features, and durability than its midrange counterpart. Is it worth the extra $300 on the price tag? That&apos;s up to you, but I&apos;d check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r">our OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 13</a> guide if you want to learn more. </p>

<ul><li>OpenAI's ChatGPT is rolling out a beta for a new feature dubbed "Scheduled Tasks."</li><li>These Tasks let users tell the AI what they need to stay reminded about or for news of a particular subject.</li><li>ChatGPT's Scheduled Tasks are rolling out for Plus, Pro, and Team users on Android, iOS, the web, and MacOS.</li><li>OpenAI recently debuted ChatGPT Search, which is yet another area the company has moved in on that reminds you of Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OpenAI is bringing a new feature to its ChatGPT beta testers that might aid them with daily tasks.</p><p>Recently, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt">detailed the start</a> of its "Scheduled Tasks" beta for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizchina.com/2025/01/15/openai-launches-tasks-feature-your-new-personal-digital-assistant/">Gizchina</a>). The changelog states that users can utilize Scheduled Tasks to create "automated prompts" that ChatGPT will run at your specified time and date. The feature is reportedly available after tapping your profile icon and navigating to "Tasks."</p><p>From there, users can create a title and an appropriate schedule. However, the most important aspect of this is the "instructions" box.</p><p>This box is where users can ask ChatGPT to remind them about something that needs to be done <em>or </em>to scour the internet for information and news. The post gives the following example: "Can you give me a briefing on AI news each afternoon?"</p><p>As the beta begins, OpenAI is already detailing the limitations of its AI-based Tasks feature. It states that, due to its utilization of GPT-4o, ChatGPT can handle 10 tasks at a time. Moreover, Tasks does not support voice chats, file uploads, or GPTs.</p><p>Some additional details regarding Tasks include the tester's ability to "edit" and "pause" them. Additionally, users can open Tasks up to notifications via the web. The company states that users will likely have to grant the AI the appropriate permissions before it can alert you once a Task is ready.</p><p>Speaking of notifications, ChatGPT's Scheduled Tasks are available for testers via mobile (Android/iOS), the web, and MacOS. Users with the Windows app will have to wait until later in Q1.</p>

<p>Users with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team should begin noticing Scheduled Tasks appear with the "beta" tag.</p><p>We've heard of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-google-keep-and-google-tasks-extensions-support">Tasks from Google</a> before and it seems that OpenAI's ChatGPT is moving in (once again) on the former's territory. More importantly, OpenAI moved in on a major part of what Google is known for in October as it debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-feature-rollout">ChatGPT Search</a>. At its core, this AI-powered search engine lets users conversate with the AI for "quick, relevant information." OpenAI also highlighted its work with news and data providers to ensure that the information users see is up-to-date.</p><p>Elsewhere, ChatGPT Search prominently features "Sources" for users interested in fact-checking the AI's online work.</p><p>What makes this feel like Google is that ChatGPT Search's responses are designed to be quick and succinct. Kind of like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">Google's AI Overviews</a>.</p>

<p>All eyes are on the Galaxy S25 series as their launch is gearing up for next week. However, it isn't stopping the leaks, and the latest one reveals the alleged Galaxy S25 series in a promo video.</p><p>Tipster OnLeaks shared the leaked promo for the Galaxy S25 series with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-promo-video.html">Android Headlines</a>. The promo offers what to expect from the trio, including the handsets' AI prowess and photography features.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! How about an early look at #GalaxyS25 Series first promo video, highlighting #Samsung's new #GalaxyAI features?...😏 On behalf of @Androidheadline 👉🏻 https://t.co/aE6O4ffUmP pic.twitter.com/Bur7lF9GcJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1880263174370501051">January 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Galaxy AI-focused short promo video begins by showcasing the Galaxy S25 Ultra in action—starting with the popular Now Bar, recently introduced via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a>. The video gives us a good look at the  Galaxy AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-latest-galaxy-s25-leak-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-a-new-one-ui-7-feature-in-action">"Now Brief" feature accessed</a> through Now Bar, which will brief your everyday mornings with weather forecasts and other popular health insights.</p><p>The video further focuses on Gemini's integration into the Google Messages app and how it will be beneficial in everyday lives for Galaxy S25 users. Later in the video, users can expect the Galaxy S25 Ultra's Night Video capture capabilities, and the popular Audio Eraser feature is also demonstrated. It helps users minimize unwanted sounds like voices, wind, and noise — captured in the video.</p><p>While it is a short leaked video, we also get to glance at all four supposed Galaxy S25 models at the end, presumably the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, the Galaxy S25 Ultra with S-Pen, and likely the Galaxy S25 Slim featured.</p>
<p>The latter happens to be the brand-new addition to the lot, which appears to have a sleek form factor, as the name implies. The recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">leaked renders</a> gave us what to expect from the handset, including its design, color options, and even the dimensions.</p><p>Per the leak, users can expect the phone to be as thin as 6.4mm, which makes it 1.8mm thinner than the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra. Like the other trio, the Slim Galaxy phone is also expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset and at least 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">everything planned</a> for January 22; it has already started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">reservations</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">Galaxy S25 series launch</a>. Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-sale-and-availability">latest leak</a>, consumers who preorder during the launch are expected to receive their handsets by February 3.</p>

You won't get as many software updates either, and I'd recommend getting the 13R if you need a new phone. </p></p>

<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N3aMiHiKHvuyugLJpuCEDT" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N3aMiHiKHvuyugLJpuCEDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> has a new design with flat sides, and honestly, I'm not a fan of the design. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r">OnePlus 13</a> has subtle bevels to make it easier to hold the device, the 13R is boxy, and it makes holding and using the phone uncomfortable. It has an aluminum mid-frame, and while it is technically thinner than the 12R, that isn't evident when holding both phones next to one another. <br><br>I like the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> better; the dual-curved aesthetic makes the phone a delight to use, and it just feels better. That said, there's an increased risk of the front or rear panes of glass taking damage should the device take a tumble, and the 13R switched to a boxy design to avoid these issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FjdWMgqnqmFwT6kkGWtK4T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FjdWMgqnqmFwT6kkGWtK4T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both devices have the alert slider, and they have fingerprint sensors located awkwardly; the 12R has the module too high up on the panel, and the 13R has one that sits too low. Rounding out the design, the 12R gets IP64 dust and water resistance, with the 13R picking up IP65. I would have liked to see IP67 on the device, but that isn't the case this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sfk3Z63yos48uth28FVC3T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sfk3Z63yos48uth28FVC3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the panel, both phones use the same 6.78-inch BOE AMOLED 120Hz screen, with identical brightness and color vibrancy. There isn't any issue with either device in outdoor use, and they do a great job delivering vibrant colors in HDR content and daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FdPQYXKj3v8ASm4mGgL48T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdPQYXKj3v8ASm4mGgL48T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only notable difference is that the 13R has a fully flat panel, so if you're not a fan of the design of the 12R, you'll like what the manufacturer is doing this time. Outside of that, the quality of the AMOLED panel itself is unchanged.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-hardware-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gUEGyG4kn8PSHefpje93T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gUEGyG4kn8PSHefpje93T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R has a considerable leg up over the 12R, and that's because it comes with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It has outstanding performance in daily use as well as gaming, and I didn't notice any slowdowns whatsoever. You also get 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage on the base model, and 12GB of RAM as standard this time. <br><br>The 12R is still decent enough in this area, but the base model has an 8GB/128GB configuration, and you just get more with the 13R. On that note, the 13R has a bigger 6000mAh battery as well, and is able to last a day and a half with ease. By contrast, the 12R averages a day with heavy use.</p>

<p>There isn't much else to talk about on the hardware side of things; both phones have strong packages, but the 13R gives you additional power, and the battery lasts longer. That said, the phone takes considerably longer to charge, going up to 56 minutes to charge the battery. The 12R, meanwhile, charges in just over 30 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-cameras-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g6LviReoKbcxCxVzEgRPFT" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g6LviReoKbcxCxVzEgRPFT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is using the same 50MP main camera, but changes to the tuning algorithms mean you get better photos. There's still some issues with tonal balance in low-light scenarios, but on the whole, it is a stronger package than last year. You even get a 50MP 2x lens this time, but the 8MP wide-angle is the same as the 12R, and it is just as average as last year. <br><br>On the whole, the 13R takes better shots in daylight situations, and the 2x lens gives the device an added versatility that's missing on the 12R. While the camera isn't quite as good as the OnePlus 13, it is among the better options in this category, and the tweaks to the 13R allow it to take the lead.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-software-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2ENQ2MBVyaQuokR67hDPGT" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ENQ2MBVyaQuokR67hDPGT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R runs OxygenOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the interface is fluid in regular use. You don't get many new features, but there is added customizability, and that's always a good thing. The software is heavily styled, so if you need a minimal interface, your best bet is still a Pixel. <br><br>That said, I didn't notice any bugs or run into issues on the software front, and that's a refreshing change of pace from previous years. There is bloatware out of the box, but it can be easily uninstalled. Outside of that, OxygenOS 15 is generally great, and it's good to see the UI not riddled with bugs at launch. <br><br>The 13R will pick up additional updates as well, with the phone slated to receive four years of Android OS updates along with six years of security updates. The 12R will get three Android OS updates (including Android 15), so it won't go beyond Android 17.</p>

<p>If you want a new phone and are deciding between these two choices, you should just get the OnePlus 13R. While I don't like the design as much, that's about the only major negative over the 12R. The 13R has better hardware, more memory and storage as standard, takes better photos, lasts longer, and will get more updates. <br><br>The phone costs $100 more in the U.S., but you're ultimately getting a better overall value. This is a no-brainer in India, where the OnePlus 13R costs the same as the 12R; if you're in the country, you should buy the 13R without any hesitation. Even in other regions, the number of upgrades on offer make the OnePlus 13R my recommendation.</p>

In just a few short weeks, I've seen phones put in dishwashers, used as cutting boards, and run over by moving vehicles. That's only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Honor sent me to its Magic 7 series launch event in Slovenia this week, and the company encouraged myself and other reviewers in attendance to push the Magic 7 Pro to its limits. That comes shortly after OnePlus invited my colleague Nicholas Sutrich to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">watch the OnePlus 13 survive a dishwasher run</a>, too.</p><p>You might be wondering what all this is about, and whether you should care — after a few days of putting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> to the test firsthand, I think I know the answer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xLJzAV329X599VP3aHaA8d" name="Honor-Magic-7-Pro-Dishwasher-2" alt="The Honor Magic 7 Pro in a dishwasher." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xLJzAV329X599VP3aHaA8d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">That's the Honor Magic 7 Pro surviving a dishwasher run with ease. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The crave for extreme durability protection for smartphones started a long time ago, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">phones first began supporting IP ratings</a> against dust and water ingress. That's a fancy way of saying that phone brands wanted to keep dust and liquids from getting inside smartphones. Premium materials, like titanium, stainless steel, and hardened glass helped fortify phones against hard drops and scuffs.</p><p>If you've ever dropped a phone on the beach or in the pool, you'll understand why. But the first Android phone to feature some degree of water resistance was the Motorola Defy about 15 years ago, so why is this extreme durability push happening now?</p><p>The truth is that new processes and innovations have enabled phones, such as the OnePlus 13, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">Motorola Moto G Power</a> or Honor Magic 7 Pro, to withstand situations that were once inconceivable. For starters, the first wave of IP69-certified smartphones are hitting global markets. Previously, IP68 was understood to be the highest level of protection against dust and water ingress. That's changed with the advent of IP69, which represents an extra degree of protection against extreme pressure, temperature, and steam.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zrK2oJANH5u3D24ZByoeP5" name="Honor-Magic-7-Pro-Dishwasher" alt="The Honor Magic 7 Pro durability tested in a kitchen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zrK2oJANH5u3D24ZByoeP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In essence, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">devices with IP68/IP69 ratings</a> can survive even the toughest challenges, like being placed in the dishwasher. The photos above show Honor putting the Magic 7 Pro in a countertop dishwasher with the display still running, and it's something that felt surreal in person.</p><p>That wasn't all. Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-unveils-the-magic-7-lite-in-europe-with-an-industry-first-battery-tech">touted the Magic 7 Lite's "Anti-Drop Display,"</a> which it says is made out of ultra-tempered glass. To put it to the test, the brand put the phone under the knife, using it as a cutting board to chop up a banana. They offered to let me try it for myself, and I winced at the idea of purposefully putting a knife against a phone screen — as a tech journalist, it feels like that should be against my religion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C679N6whJ8Nogqbc9wXmRY" name="Honor-Magic-7-Lite-Knife" alt="Cutting a banana on a Magic 7 Lite phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C679N6whJ8Nogqbc9wXmRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that just about sums up how confident companies are getting about their phones' durability. It's easy to make claims on spec sheets and press releases. It's a lot more brazen to conduct real-world tests in front of reporters, where there's always a chance of disaster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqGf8pqCZi0" target="_blank">like the infamous Tesla Cybertruck reveal</a>.</p><p>Things once again took a borderline insane turn when Honor let the Magic 7 Lite get run over by an ATV, and then get casually dropped off an ATV driving at speed on a rocky dirt road.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WesE8rVGTSU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>It's absolutely impressive that the Honor Magic 7 Lite, a phone that costs under €400 in Europe, can survive these kinds of tests. It's also quite nice that the Motorola Moto G Power, soon to be available for under $300 in the U.S., supports IP68/IP69 durability ratings. But how much should this matter to a normal person like you and me, who uses their phone for normal tasks?</p><p>I think that depends. After I saw what the Magic 7 Pro and Lite could do, I also became a little brazen while testing out my loaner device. While using the phone caseless, I recorded videos of myself sledding and driving my own quad bike with the Honor Magic 7 Pro. Maybe you don't need a dedicated action camera or a rugged case if these are the kinds of extreme situations that your phone is tested to survive.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Jjv93PGr8E" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>With that being said, the Honor Magic 7 series isn't indestructible. It's going to break, scratch, and crack under the right conditions. While I watched the Magic 7 Lite survive roughly a four-foot fall at speed in Slovenia, it's possible your phone falls out of your pocket at the dinner table and cracks. Sometimes, there's no rhyme or reason to when phones fail, no matter how durability standards they meet or how many real-world tests they survive.</p><p>So, I won't go out and say that buying a OnePlus 13 or a Magic 7 series phone is a must if you care about durability. However, I will say that from what I've seen, phone brands are getting more confident than ever about their devices' durability.</p><p>Whether you use your smartphone to go to the office and back or take it on extreme excursions, that's good news. Anything that can be done to make phones tougher to crack and prevent water or dust from entering is a solid step in the right direction. With the advent of IP69 smartphones, it's possible that phones like the Honor Magic 7 Pro, Moto G Power, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Oppo Find X8 Pro</a>, and OnePlus 13 aren't just taking a step — they could be taking a leap.</p>

Honor is doubling down on AI integration, rolling out a slate of new features that transform how you use the phone. <br><br>There's a new design as well, the latest Qualcomm hardware, a third-gen silicon-carbon battery, and upgraded cameras — including a 200MP telephoto lens at the back. The software has gotten a fresh coat of paint as well, with the phone running MagicOS 9.0 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. <br><br>With other Chinese brands raising the bar for imaging thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, I wanted to see how Honor measures up. I used the Magic 7 Pro as my daily driver for just over two weeks, and here's why I think it is one of the best phones of 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kALW2PBmVMTYGaUES36JUC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kALW2PBmVMTYGaUES36JUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor unveiled the Magic 7 Pro in China on October 30, and the phone made its global debut at an event in Slovenia on January 15, 2025. It is now on sale in global markets in a single 12GB/512GB variant, which costs £1,099 ($1,343) in the U.K. and €1,299 ($1,336) in other countries in Europe. <br><br>Honor is incentivizing the launch in the U.K. by providing a £200 ($244) discount and the 100W charger (which isn't bundled this time), and rolling out a one-time replacement within 180 days. This is highly interesting, and similar to what OnePlus did with the OnePlus 13 in India. Essentially, if you notice any hardware issues within six months of use, you'll be eligible to get a new Magic 7 Pro instead of sending it in for service.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-design"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tVxHWUQiMn4v4E9tcr96XC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro next to Magic 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tVxHWUQiMn4v4E9tcr96XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone I used recently, the Magic 7 Pro has a design with flat sides. It's clear that all manufacturers are gravitating toward this design aesthetic, and I can see the reason why; not having dual-curved edges means the glass panes are less prone to breakage in the case of a tumble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3voE6dVGw4QcZAutEfhSWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro profile view with IR blaster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3voE6dVGw4QcZAutEfhSWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the sides are thicker, the use of beveled edges make holding and using the phone comfortable. This is in line with what OnePlus did on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and the Magic 7 Pro has a similar in-hand feel. Weight distribution is great as well, and even though you get a massive camera island at the back, the device doesn't feel unwieldy in the least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7ssfJN8CuoPeuUf5xcPDYC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view with camera island highlighted against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ssfJN8CuoPeuUf5xcPDYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the changes to the camera island as well; the module is inlaid with metal and has a squircle design, and it looks cleaner than last year. The way the island merges seamlessly into the back is reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-find-x5-pro-review">Find X5 Pro</a>, and the overall effect is elegant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qm2LQppkPAdkKztnqW2MRC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qm2LQppkPAdkKztnqW2MRC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Magic 7 Pro is available in blue, black, and Lunar Shadow Grey color variants, and the latter option is the most interesting of the lot. I got the black model, and it isn't anywhere as interesting — if you're eyeing the device, I'd suggesting picking up the grey model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ktpAWBT9NUmSuhx6g4fFSC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ktpAWBT9NUmSuhx6g4fFSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back doesn't draw too much attention to itself (at least in this colorway), and you get a silky texture that ensures smudges don't show up. There's adequate width on the sides to hold the device comfortably, and the power button has a red accent that gives it a little bit of character.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RRQ5DrS2GVCVjzTJMhBKVC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro home page with colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RRQ5DrS2GVCVjzTJMhBKVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another positive is the ultrasonic sensor; it is located in the ideal position, and is fast to authenticate. Honor is an outlier among Android manufacturers in that it uses a secondary camera at the front, and this is used to enable 3D face unlock. While all Android phones have a similar feature, they're not as secure as biometrics; thankfully, that isn't an issue on the Magic 7 Pro, and you get two secure methods to unlock the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="quuM2uw7phRsfVxx2FQ6TC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro bottom view with USB-C charging port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quuM2uw7phRsfVxx2FQ6TC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to other Chinese phones, the Magic 7 Pro gets IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, and it can withstand immersion in up to 1.5 meters of water in addition to high pressure water jets and hot liquids up to 80 degrees Celsius. If anything, the only quibble I have with the design is that the device is heavy at 223g — the same as the X200 Pro. However, you get a smaller 5270mAh battery (X200 Pro has 6000mAh), and the phone is chunkier at 8.8mm (versus 8.2mm).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7RG4bxNboXmKKtnjEKNTWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7RG4bxNboXmKKtnjEKNTWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there are no problems with the design. In addition to the regular model, Honor is rolling out the Porsche Design variant of the device, and like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-review">Magic 6 RSR</a>, it has a hexagonal camera island and is available in two interesting colors. The rest of the hardware is identical to the regular model, but you get a few unique UI elements, and I particularly like the Standby mode that's available on the device.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-display"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="psquvKEFg3gdjXcU97mSWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro home page with colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psquvKEFg3gdjXcU97mSWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor is using a similar-sized 6.8-inch AMOLED panel as last year, and you get the same 5000-nit maximum brightness. That number is meaningless in real-world use as it's only limited to select zones when viewing HDR content; thankfully, the phone holds up rather well even under harsh sunlight, and it is among the brightest I tested — only the Pixel 9 Pro XL got brighter in outdoor use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VFZixvLaZ86tm5UVdT9HcC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro with YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VFZixvLaZ86tm5UVdT9HcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are vibrant and detailed, and contrast levels are excellent as well. The phone goes up to 120Hz, and like other flagships, you get dynamic refresh that scales it between 1Hz to 120Hz based on the on-screen content. The phone has HDR integration, and there's a dynamic video mode that boosts colors in the gallery, Instagram, and YouTube.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oWDbPoboHNFz8iiSJbdBZC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro eye comfort settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oWDbPoboHNFz8iiSJbdBZC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like last year, you get 4320Hz PWM dimming, and while other manufacturers are now doing the same on their devices, Honor leads the way when it comes to eye-care tech on its phones. The Magic 7 Pro gets a suite of features in this regard, including myopic defocus stimulation, circular polarization, and natural tone. In short, the Magic 7 Pro has enough novel display tech that if you're worried about eye fatigue or strain, this is clearly the device to get.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ERLqiebQxWJBZhjWoVJ3YC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro ebook mode with Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERLqiebQxWJBZhjWoVJ3YC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While all of those features are great, what I like the most is that there's a dedicated ebook mode that switches the panel to monochrome. I used this feature extensively in legacy OxygenOS and MIUI builds, but it's not available in recent versions of the skins, so it's great to see Honor offering the feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sAfdMaykHW4v6thikCaxWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAfdMaykHW4v6thikCaxWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had no issues with the Magic 7 Pro when it comes to playing videos or gaming, and the phone has outstanding built-in stereo sound. Honor says it increased the sound cavity this time to create a sense of depth, and that's noticeable in daily use.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-performance"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Performance</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HEw3C2BcChtPzq4BbcWRVC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro about page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HEw3C2BcChtPzq4BbcWRVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor went with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the global model is sold in a 12GB/512GB configuration. Ideally, Honor should have brought the 16GB/512GB edition outside China, but that isn't the case. Regardless, I didn't see any issues with memory being the bottleneck in the two weeks I used the device.<br><br>Similar to other flagships I tested recently, the phone absolutely flies in regular use, and there are no slowdowns whatsoever. The phone handles demanding games without breaking a sweat, and if anything, there's a sense that we need better games on Android to take full advantage of the power available this generation.</p>

<p>The only issue in this area is that the device gets noticeably hotter than its rivals during extended gaming sessions. I saw the phone go up to 48 degrees Celsius, four degrees hotter than the X200 Pro. The upside is that the Magic 7 Pro posted the highest scores of any device I tested.</p><p>While most brands prioritize thermal management, Honor has a higher threshold in this area, with little to no throttling until the device gets hot enough that you won't be able to hold it comfortably anyway. Outside of that, there are no problems with the hardware.</p><p>Call and cellular connectivity is great, and you get an AI privacy mode and ambient noise reduction while making calls. The vibration motor is decent enough as well, and while you don't get feedback while navigating the interface — a long-standing issue in MagicOS — you can set up Gboard to use the haptic motor, and it works well. <br><br>Coming to connectivity, you get the usual Wi-Fi 7 modem and Bluetooth 5.4, along with NFC, dual-band GPS, AptX HD, and USB-C over the USB 3.2 standard with DisplayPort 1.2. You can easily connect the device to an external monitor, and it holds up well in this situation.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-battery-life"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Battery life</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBmNSXcr9a4kzw34yUrVWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro battery section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBmNSXcr9a4kzw34yUrVWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor has been using silicon-carbon batteries on its phones for over two years now, and the Magic 7 Pro sees the debut of the third-gen silicon tech. The material used in the anode of the battery is made by Group14, and Honor went with a single-cell design. <br><br>Annoyingly, the global model of the Magic 7 Pro has a smaller 5270mAh battery, while the Chinese variant has a 5850mAh battery. I still got a day's worth of use consistently even with heavy use, and didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day. With medium use, the phone manages to last a day and a half, but battery life isn't as great as the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PErv6dQxcnGAjCKFrEdfUC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PErv6dQxcnGAjCKFrEdfUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get 100W charging, and while that's great to see, Honor isn't bundling a charger this time. While Apple, Samsung, and Google don't include a charger on their phones, their devices still use outdated charging tech, and any basic USB PD charger will be more than adequate. That isn't the case on Chinese phones, so to not include a charger is an egregious omission. <br><br>The phone has 80W wireless charging as well, but I wasn't able to test it out as I don't have a requisite charger. Anyway, it takes just under 50 minutes to charge the battery using Honor's 100W charger, and you can use a USB PD charger with the phone as well, which will lower the charging speed to 60W. <br><br>Honor has the usual battery modes that allow you to set a charging limit, and optimize charging when you have the phone plugged in overnight. While the battery life is great in its own right, the lack of a bundled charger is irksome to say the least.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-cameras"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="roDugFqpKLorseDCnmsCbC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roDugFqpKLorseDCnmsCbC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor is using a 50MP Super Dynamic Falcon Main Camera on the Magic 7 Pro, and as you can imagine, it does a pretty great job in challenging situations. The most notable inclusion is a 200MP telephoto lens, and it does a magnificent job. Honor isn't using Samsung's latest HP9 imaging module like the Vivo X100 Ultra and X200 Pro — instead leveraging the HP3 sensor — but you get 3x optical zoom, 6x lossless zoom, and AI-assisted digital zoom going up to 100x. There's also a 50MP wide-angle lens, and a 50MP camera at the front. <br><br>Honor is debuting a new image engine where it's leaning heavily on AI models to tweak every photo, including adjusting shadows and highlights. The reasoning is that you get standout shots in any scenario, and while it works well most of the time, it leads to a few inconsistencies when shooting in little to no light. <br><br>You get the usual suite of AI-assisted object detection and edition tools, and the camera interface itself hasn't changed. All cameras can shoot 4K60 video, and you get HDR video that delivers better colors. Similar to last year, you get Harcourt profiles in portrait shots, with three options available: Vibrant, Colour, and Classic. <br><br>Honor is leveraging an on-device portrait library to enable AI-assisted portraits, and the brand says it has over a million shadow profiles and a billion settings. Toggling the feature does make a difference, and it is another way Honor is turning to AI to make its cameras stand out.</p>

<p>The main camera takes outstanding photos in any situation, delivering images with great dynamic range and white balance. Colors aren't overly saturated, foliage is rendered accurately, and it does a better job than last year in low-light images and videos. There are no issues with the wide-angle lens either, and it manages to take detailed shots in any situation. <br><br>One of the best things about having a telephoto lens with a massive sensor is that it doubles up as a portrait shooter, and the Magic 7 Pro does a brilliant job in this situation. It isn't quite as good as what Vivo manages on its devices, but it comes mighty close, delivering stunning photos at 3x and 6x. <br><br>There's 100x zoom as well, and like everything else, the feature is getting an infusion of AI — albeit via an OTA after January. Honor says you can get usable shots at 100x, with the phone using a cloud-based AI model to eke out additional details in shots. The phone uses an on-device model as long as the zoom factor is under 30x, and it is interesting to see how the feature holds up in actual use. <br><br>Overall, the Magic 7 Pro has one of the best camera packages available today, and while I still give the edge to Vivo's X200 Pro, there isn't as wide a gulf as last year, and that's great to see.</p>

<p>The Magic 7 Pro runs MagicOS 9.0 based on Android 15, and Honor is doubling down on AI features. While the UI itself is better than last year, it is in need of a visual overhaul. The notification pane needs attention as well, with Honor still using outdated cards which don't let you expand notifications with a pull-down gesture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qG8rUE6XhqagMsugSBkxWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qG8rUE6XhqagMsugSBkxWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm using a pre-release version of the software (build 9.0.0.132), and as the build doesn't have Google Play certification, it had issues installing apps I waste an inordinate amount of time on (Balatro and Relay). Honor says customers will have a day-one OTA that won't have these issues, and I'll update this post once that's available. <br><br>As for the software itself, the biggest difference between the China model and the global variant is that the latter has tight Google integration; Gemini is pre-installed, and you get Circle to Search as standard. There's no shortage of AI-based utilities, with the device offering real-time translation, notes summarization, text extraction, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro search using AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Look, I'm not sold on the generative AI boondoggle, but an easy way to extract text from a PDF and paste it in a chat? I'm onboard with that. This is where Honor's Magic Portal becomes the differentiator; while the feature had limited usability in the past, there's integration with services you actually use now, and it's very handy to be able to paste text, links, and images when you're browsing into a chat, or send location details.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w8AokJEfa5B9RM3TWoDTWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro Magic Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8AokJEfa5B9RM3TWoDTWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, you get the ability to search text or images using a knock gesture, and it works reasonably well. Overall, I like what Honor is doing with the interface, and even though I'm not using the final build, I didn't run into any stability issues or lag. <br><br>When it comes to software updates, the Magic 7 Pro will get five years of Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates. That's more than what you get with other Chinese manufacturers, and is the right move by Honor.</p>

<p>With other brands releasing products sooner than before, there's a good selection of options if you want a high-end phone right now. Vivo's X200 Pro continues to deliver the best camera package, but the phone isn't available in the west, instead limited to Asian countries. <br><br>The OnePlus 13 doesn't have any shortcomings regarding availability, and it is one of the best devices you can buy in 2025. It has a gorgeous design, same great hardware as the Magic 7 Pro, and you get a bigger 6000mAh battery. The cameras are much better this time as well, and coming in at $899/£899, it undercuts the Magic 7 Pro by a considerable amount.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best display tech available</li><li>You want the latest hardware</li><li>You need versatile cameras that take great photos and videos</li><li>You're looking for useful AI tech</li></ul>

<p>Honor did all the right things with the Magic 7 Pro. The design makes the device better to hold and use, and it should have better durability as well. The high-quality AMOLED panel combined with all the eye protection features Honor included makes the screen on the Magic 7 Pro one of the best around, and there are absolutely no issues with color vibrancy or brightness levels. <br><br>There's nothing wrong with the hardware either; the phone blazes through demanding games, and while it gets hot during extended gaming sessions, there are no problems with throttling. I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day, and while it doesn't last as long as the X200 Pro, it easily manages a day and a bit even with heavy use. <br><br>Then there's the software. Honor did a great job integrating AI-backed utilities into just about every facet of the interface, and they're actually useful. But it's the cameras that truly differentiate the Magic 7 Pro; the phone takes fantastic photos in just about any lighting situation, and you get detailed shots even at 30x zoom and beyond. <br><br>Should you get the Magic 7 Pro over what Google and Samsung have to offer? The camera is better than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, you get additional versatility thanks to the 200MP sensor, and the overall hardware is better as well. If anything, the biggest rival to the Magic 7 Pro is the Vivo X200 Pro, but seeing as how you can't get that device reliably in western markets, the Magic 7 Pro has a distinct advantage.</p>

It’s about 1.44GB, and you can grab it by heading to your phone's Settings menu and then navigating to "Download and install" under "System update."</p><p>However, the update is rolling out in stages, so it reaches users gradually.</p><p>As mentioned in Nothing's community <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/25045-cmf-phone-1-nothing-os-v30-250111-2249-changelog" target="_blank">post</a>, the CMF Phone 1 update brings a bunch of new features, like fresh widgets, customizable lock screen options, a revamped app drawer, and an improved quick settings menu.</p><p>Furthermore, it adds Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and all the other goodies you’d expect from Nothing OS 3.</p><p>Early feedback on the Nothing Phone (1) update shows it’s running smoothly, but there’s one downside: the Circle to Search feature, which is available on newer models, is missing here, as pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/16/nothing-phone-1-android-15-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The latest update for the Phone (1) likely marks its last major software update. Even so, Nothing is expected to make good on its promise of at least one more year of security patches to keep the device protected from new threats.</p><p>On the other hand, since the CMF Phone 1 launched with Android 14, it’s fair to expect at least one more major OS update down the line.</p><p>While Nothing is showing it’s serious about timely updates, even for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget-friendly phones</a>, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series is still waiting on the One UI 7 update.</p><p>To be fair, Samsung has built a solid reputation for pushing out updates on time, so this delay with One UI 7 could just be them taking extra care to iron out any bugs before the stable release hits its devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is taking its AI model Gemini and bringing it to more users involved in two of its Workspace plans.</p><p>The company recently announced through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/01/expanding-google-ai-to-more-of-google-workspace.html">Workspace Updates</a> that it is bringing Gemini to users subscribed to its Workspace Business and Enterprise plans. Those with the Business Starter, Standard, and Plus plans started receiving Gemini on January 15. According to Google, its AI model additions will concern Gmail, Docs, Meet, Drive, Sheets, Chat, and Slides. Additionally, the company is giving its Business and Enterprise users access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> and NotebookLM Plus.</p><p>Google went into more detail regarding Gemini's debut in Business and Enterprise in a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/empowering-businesses-with-AI">blog post</a>.</p><p>There, the company states users will find "simplified pricing" with its included AI software. Google gives the example of a Workspace Business Standard user who, currently, pays $32 per month, per user. However, the simplified pricing will drop that total down to $14 per month, per user with the Gemini Business add-on. There is a fully updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/15400543?visit_id=638726532376571327-897289470&p=gemini_update_business&rd=1">table of pricing</a> following this announcement available for users. The post states that its monthly pricing will see these updates on March 17 "or at renewal date with an Annual/Fixed-term plan."</p><p>What's more, Google mentioned security following its recent massive drop of AI to a wealth of its subscribers. The company states, "We don’t use your data, prompts, or generated responses to train Gemini models outside of your domain without permission." It adds that it also doesn't "sell your data" for ad purposes.</p><p>Users are said to remain in control, meaning that Gemini will only leverage data that you make available to it.</p><p>Speaking of your data, as Gemini rolls in, users will find a few features for each Workspace app, such as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">help me write</a>" in Gmail. The feature will help users "write and improve" emails and alter a message's tone of voice through Gemini. Additionally, like what you'll find in Docs, Gmail users will find AI-generated email and document summaries.</p>

<p>There were several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">generative AI-based tools</a> that Google highlighted early last year for Workspace. Among them is the ability to have auto-generated images, audio, and videos for work in Slides. Joining that are auto-completed analyses, formula generation, and more in Sheets. Interested users can read the full changelog packed with Gemini AI assistance in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/01/expanding-google-ai-to-more-of-google-workspace.html#:~:text=January%2029%2C%202025%3A-,Gmail,-Help%20me%20write">updated Workspace post</a>.</p><p>As previously mentioned, Google is giving Workspace Business and Enterprise users access to its NotebookLM, which recently introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a>. These grant users two AI voices that act like co-hosts of a podcast or talk show. The AI will condense information in a lengthy document and turn it into something light, yet informational for you to listen to. The AI is said to "make connections" while it discusses the data you've provided.</p><p>In October, the company brought another update that lets users "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">guide</a>" the AI in NotebookLM. Essentially, users can tell the AI how the conversation should flow and what it should focus on.</p><p>As Google's Workspace Business users get into Gemini, the company states that its three Enterprise editions will receive the AI on January 29.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Galaxy S25 leaks don't stop coming as another batch of devices renders surface, which show off every possible color for 2025.</p><p>The leaked batch of Galaxy S25 colors reportedly surfaced via an email from known X tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://substack.com/@evleaks/notes">Evan Blass</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/16/samsung-galaxy-s25-color-leak/">9to5Google</a>). It was stated that the tipster provided images for every S25 phone color; however, it appears void of the specific names of these colors. Regardless, the leak kicks off with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which will allegedly offer consumers four colors once it launches.</p><p>The renderings display the phone in black, white, a light or grayish blue, and gray.</p><p>Also, the images give us an uninhibited look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">subtle design changes</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, such as its rounded corners, black ring camera lenses, and thin display bezels.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is next, as the leak shows off four colors for this device. Blass' imagery shows off the phone in light blue, mint, darker (or navy) blue, and gray options. The leak contained the alleged colors for the base Galaxy S25, as well; however, it will seemingly share the same palette as its Plus sibling.</p><p>While we're showing off a few options here, the full gallery can be viewed at 9to5.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the publication speculates that the recent leak by Evan Blass isn't the full scope of Samsung's Galaxy S25 reveal. There's reportedly a chance that the company could have a few "Samsung Store Exclusive" options up its sleeve. This <em>seems </em>likely, especially considering the company's past. In 2024, the Samsung Store brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ph/mobile/mobile-phone-buying-guide/galaxy-s24-colors/">three exclusive options</a> for the S24 Ultra: Titanium Blue, Titanium Green, and Titanium Orange.</p><p>The S24 and S24 Plus saw the same colors, but they were named Sapphire Blue, Jade Green, and Sandstone Orange.</p><p>While the tipster's recent leak seemingly surfaced without the potential color names, another leak — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-series-rendering-design-leak">that revealed the series' renders</a> — included some monikers. The Galaxy S25 Ultra could see options like Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver. The other two siblings may see Silver Shadow, Ice Blue, Navy, and Mint. These renders surfaced shortly after a discovery was made about the (alleged) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">specification sheet</a> for the flagship trio.</p><p>Elsewhere, a Thailand-based retailer slipped up this week and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-case-surface-early-retail-listing-leaked">posted the cases for the Galaxy S25 series</a> far too early. The shop quickly rectified its mistake, but not before a screenshot got out to the public. It seems Samsung is preparing to bring its "Standing Grip Case" for the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Plus models, as well as some basic silicone cases.</p><p>The next flagship series will debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">on January 22</a> during Unpacked.

<ul><li>Google has partnered with a renowned online news organization, the Associated Press, to help Gemini provide a feed of real-time information.</li><li>This is an attempt to explore the benefits of AI while partnering with news ecosystems to help strengthen journalism and reduce misinformation, Google says.</li><li>Not much information about how this partnership will play out has been divulged, but it seems likely that AP's news content will be integrated into Gemini's responses.</li></ul>

<p>Google is trying to expand Gemini's skill set so that the app can provide accurate and timely information for those who need it. For the first time, it has partnered with a news organization that will help deliver up-to-date news on the Gemini app.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/news/associated-press-gemini-app/" target="_blank">Keyword announcement</a>, Google said it has decided to collaborate with the Associated Press (AP), which will now deliver a feed of real-time information to "enhance the usefulness of results displayed in the Gemini app."</p><p>This is a step in the right direction for people to start trusting AI-generated content and address concerns surrounding misinformation. Teaming up with a news organization would help Gemini link search results to reliable news stories.</p><p>“We are pleased Google recognizes the value of AP's journalism as well as our commitment to nonpartisan reporting, in the development of its generative AI products," said AP senior vice president and chief revenue officer Kristin Heitmann in the Keyword.</p><p>Google has been striving to help ease users into the idea of AI and has introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-international-fact-checking-day-2024-updates" target="_blank">several tools</a> like 'About this image' and 'About this page'  so that people can find out the source of their search results.</p><p>That said, not much information has been divulged about how this partnership will play out in real time. When we asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, it stated that "AP news content will be integrated into Gemini's responses, giving users access to up-to-date information." Gemini also stated that the initial rollout will focus on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> subscribers.</p><p>“AP and Google’s longstanding relationship is based on working together to provide timely, accurate news and information to global audiences,” Heitmann added.</p>

<p>It isn't the first time that AP has cracked a deal with an AI platform. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-gemini-ai-associated-press-ap-0b57bcf8c80dd406daa9ba916adacfaf" target="_blank">publisher</a>, the organization has been trying to expand its revenue stream in recent years, and in 2023, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-associated-press-ap-f86f84c5bcc2f3b98074b38521f5f75a" target="_blank">signed a deal</a> with OpenAI, enabling the AI company "to license AP’s archive of news stories to train future versions of its AI systems."</p><p>Some argue that monetizing data and information to improve AI's capabilities could take a dangerous turn in the long run. “By outsourcing their value to tech companies, news outlets may cede control over how their work is used,”  Sarah Kreps, a professor and director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, told AP.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is expanding its Care Plus subscription for your Galaxy devices with another type of unlimited repair.</p><p>As highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/15/samsung-care-plus-free-screen-repairs/">9to5Google</a>, the Samsung Care Plus with Theft & Loss package has now rolled out support for "unlimited screen repairs." Per the c<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/samsung-care-plus/">ompany's website</a>, the "unlimited protection" plan now includes "same-day $0 cracked screen and back glass repairs." Samsung adds that users will have access to these repairs at over 700 of its authorized locations. Consumers have the option of mailing-in their devices, as well, per the publication.</p><p>Things aren't as cut and dry as Samsung states the same-day portion of this plan "may be available for eligible devices in <em>select </em>areas." While this plan supports its Galaxy devices like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a>, it reportedly does not service the brand's foldable phones.</p><p>The folks at 9to5 were also given a quick note about this Theft & Loss addition, which states Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 is eligible for its unlimited screen repairs.</p><p>Samsung's debut of cracked screen repairs applies to Care Plus subscribers <em>without </em>Theft & Loss attached, too. For this, the company states users will have to chuck up a $29 fee at any of its locations for device service. Those with Samsung Care Plus Essentials are left out of this screen repair service.</p>

<p>Expanding the reach of coverage occurred early last year as Samsung announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-care-plus-unlimited-battery-repair-notification">its unlimited battery support</a> for Care Plus subscribers. There was a catch to this as the company stated users will receive repairs so long as there is no "additional damage" <em>and </em>your device is still covered. The battery repair service only applies to users with devices that have a total battery charge capacity under 79%.</p><p>Following the announcement last March, Samsung brought it to its Care Plus subscribers that May. However, it came with an extra $2 charge on their typical monthly bill, per an email.</p><p>The addition lets users walk into several of Samsung's stores for battery repairs. The addition seemed to make sense, especially after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-batteries-plus-expanded-partnership">partnered with Batteries Plus</a>. In 2023, Samsung and Batteries Plus got together to convert 35 stores across the U.S. into Samsung Authorization Service Centers. The work done there enables consumers to get a device fixed in two hours or less.</p><p>In other news, it's nice to see Samsung granting its Galaxy S25 series some support — even though it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">not here until January 22</a>.

<ul><li>WhatsApp announces some new and upcoming features for its Android and iOS platforms.</li><li>The messaging service brings video call effects for traditional photo and video sharing within the chats.</li><li>Users can also share quicker emoji reactions to messages in their respective WhatsApp chats.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has announced that it is starting 2025 with a bunch of new features coming to Android and as well as iOS users.</p><p>In an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-year-new-ways-to-chat-on-whatsapp">blog post</a> this week, the messaging platform shared some new features and design improvements that users can see on WhatsApp this year. Meta-owned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging service</a> introduced an effects feature for video calls last year.</p><p>With the new update, people who often take photos and videos in chats will now be able to use those effects. This means users will be able to choose the same 30 backgrounds, filters, and effects to transform what they capture and share in their chats.</p>
<p>WhatsApp on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> already allows users to take selfies and immediately convert them into relevant stickers. This can be done by tapping the create sticker option, which opens up the camera for users to click selfies and create stickers hassle-free. According to the blog post, it is coming soon to iOS users this year.</p><p>The messaging platform will also allow users to easily share their favorite sticker packs right from their chats. Lastly, WhatsApp users will be able to quickly react to a message in a chat by simply double-tapping the respective message and scrolling through the most-used emoji reactions.</p><p>While these seem to be a bunch of new features coming to the platform, WhatsApp notes that it is looking forward to introducing "more exciting features" that are set to be released throughout 2025.</p>

The relevant widget has been spotted recently in the WhatsApp beta <strong>2.25.1.27</strong> version. It is believed to be coming in a 4x1 layout, and users are required to access WhatsApp's AI chat feature to use it.</p><p>Once the widget is enabled, users can tap the text field to start asking Meta AI or use the camera icon in the same widget to click something and ask questions about it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android 15 hit a wide variety of Android phones last year, but Google Pixel devices got a few exclusive perks with a Pixel Feature Drop in October 2024. Part of the update included a clever Pixel ecosystem feature that makes it easier for people with multiple Pixel phones and tablets to manage notifications. It leverages Google's Cross Device Service, and ensures you won't have to clear out the same notifications on each of your Pixel devices.</p><p>The feature, called <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong>, is only useful if you enable it on all your Pixel phones and tablets running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> for the same Google account. Setup requires a handful of taps and granting a few permissions. Luckily, you only have to do it once for each phone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and we've got a complete guide walking you through the process below.</p>
<h2 id="how-notification-sync-works-on-pixel-phones-and-pixel-tablet-2">How notification sync works on Pixel phones and Pixel Tablet</h2>
<p>The idea behind <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong> is simple. Chances are, you're signed into the same accounts on all your Pixel phones and tablets, and you'll get duplicate notifications from those accounts. To save you from manually clearing these notifications on every Pixel device you own, Google will intelligently do it for you with this feature enabled.</p><p>The notification statuses for devices only sync when they are connected to a Wi-Fi network at the moment. There's reason to believe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-finally-let-you-sync-pixel-notifications-over-cellular-data">Google is working on a cellular data option</a>, but it isn't available yet.</p><p>To use this feature, follow the steps below on all your Pixel devices. Make sure they're updated to the latest version of Android 15 and are using the same Google account.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-on-pixel-notification-sync-2">How to turn on Pixel notification sync</h2>
<p>After updating all your Pixel devices to the latest build of Android 15, you'll need to manually enable the <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices </strong>feature on each Pixel phone or tablet you own. Further, you'll need to select the Google account you want to dismiss notifications for. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel phone or tablet.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab in the list.</p><p>3. Scroll down to the <strong>Sync across devices</strong> section and press <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap the toggle beside <strong>Dismiss on this device</strong>.</p>

<p>5. A prompt will appear titled <strong>Allow notification access for this feature</strong>. Tap <strong>Go</strong> to continue.</p><p>6. This will jump you to the <strong>Notification read, reply, and control </strong>page for the <strong>Device Connectivity Service</strong>. Tap the toggle beside <strong>Allow notification access</strong>.</p><p>7. Tap <strong>Allow</strong> on the prompt that appears.</p><p>8. Return to the <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong> page and tap the Google account you want to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2m34YHMpPgYBaNbuuQkMEN" name="Dismiss-Pixel-Notifications-Screenshots-2" alt="The dismiss notifications across Pixel devices settings options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2m34YHMpPgYBaNbuuQkMEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>9. Repeat these steps on each Pixel device you want to use with notification sync.</p>
<p>From there, notifications you have dismissed on one device will automatically be dismissed on others with this setting enabled. You can turn this feature off, or change the Google account used, at any time in the Settings app.</p>

<p>This handy notification sync feature will be most useful for people who own a Pixel phone, like the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>, and a Pixel Tablet. It'll also be convenient for those with multiple Pixel phones — you might have a work and personal Pixel, or simply keep an old Pixel phone around for use as a media player or a backup. Whatever your reason for using multiple Pixel devices, this notification syncing feature will make sure you don't get déjà vu clearing out old notifications more than once.</p>

Maybe.</p><p>Last spring, the Biden administration passed legislation that would ban TikTok on national security grounds unless the parent company, ByteDance, sells off the U.S. version of the app to another company.</p><p>If the ban passes as scheduled, Apple and Google would be forced to remove the app from their respective app stores, though existing users can still use the app if it was already installed. Eventually, though, the older versions of the app will stop working altogether.</p><p>ByteDance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bytedance-prefers-tiktok-shutdown-us-if-legal-options-fail-sources-say-2024-04-25/" target="_blank">hasn't shown much interest</a> in selling off TikTok's U.S. assets, so TikTok has explored other options, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-is-suing-the-us-government-to-stop-a-law-that-bans-the-app" target="_blank">appealing the legislation</a> in the Supreme Court, saying it violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government infringement of free speech.</p><p>It seems that the Supreme Court justices are willing to allow the ban to go forward, but no decision has been made at the time of this writing. TikTok has reportedly stated that it will shut down the app in the U.S. if the ban goes through. Android Central has reached out to TikTok regarding its plans and will update this article when we have more information</p><p>TikTok does have another hope, though, and that lies with the U.S. Senate and President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has decided he doesn't want TikTok banned, though he has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html">called for it in the past</a>. He is urging the Supreme Court to halt or delay the ban until he has time to pursue negotiations.</p><p>According to a brief filed by Trump last Friday, "<em>President Trump alone possesses the consummate deal-making expertise, the electoral mandate and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the government — concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged.</em>"</p><p>President Trump will be sworn into office on January 20, just one day after the ban. He could then pause the ban for 90 days if TikTok has shown a willingness to comply. Senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and ED Markey (D-MA) have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-markey-paul-rep-khanna-file-bipartisan-bicameral-amicus-brief-urging-scotus-to-protect-free-speech-and-reverse-tiktok-ban">filed a brief</a> with the court to delay the ban.</p><p>Finally, Senator Markey, a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, also has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-to-introduce-bill-to-extend-deadline-for-tiktok-ban-takes-to-senate-floor-in-support-of-vibrant-online-communities">introduced legislation</a> to Congress to extend the ban by 120 days. Market acknowledges TikTok's dangers and possible security issues but says too many people depend on the app economically.</p><p><em>“Let me be clear: TikTok has its problems. Like every social media platform, TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our young people. I will continue to hold TikTok accountable for such behavior. But a TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and their economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.”</em></p>

<p>None of this may matter, and come Sunday, TikTok will be banned in the U.S. Some people will approve, some not, and others are apathetic over the situation.</p><p>One thing to consider is that lawmakers — even the few who <em>aren't</em> tech luddites — who have seen the intelligence reports support some sort of action are the ones who called for the ban. Regular people who love or loathe TikTok have not seen it. That doesn't mean we can't have an opinion.</p><p>My own? If there are true national security issues with TikTok and not just xenophobic drumming against China, ban it until they can be addressed. Go a step further and block it. Maybe even take the necessary action so it can't be accessed through a VPN (yes, that's 100% possible). Then extend the same scrutiny to <em><strong>all</strong></em> tech companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-us-lawkmakers-want-tiktok-banned">not just the ones from China</a></p><p>I've asked around the office and the internet-at-large, and opinions are mixed. I've heard things like, "I don't care, but my partner does," "I'm not in the U.S., so I'm unaffected," and people in India are just saying, "What's TikTok?" (The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/indian-government-bans-tiktok-uc-browser-and-other-chinese-apps-security-reasons">Indian government banned TikTok</a> in 2020 over national security concerns.)</p><p>People opposed to the ban bring up some very valid points — should the government infringe on TikTok's First Amendment protections, and why aren't Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram facing the same ban?</p><p>The obvious answer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tech-war-china-ramping">China</a>. The U.S. and China are not on very friendly terms so any advantage China may gain through data collected by TikTok is concerning. Facebook and other U.S. companies can be forced to do things the government's way via legislation. Chinese companies can't.</p><p>The First Amendment question may soon be answered by the Supreme Court; even a non-decision acknowledges that TikTok's protections can be limited.</p><p>We'll know more on Sunday.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>The best</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 13 is one of the best flagships of 2025. It has a stunning design with a new microfiber vegan leather back that feels great to hold and use, and the chassis has increased resilience against tumbles. You get the latest Qualcomm silicon, and the phone is among the fastest I've used. The cameras at the back hold their own against the best that Google and Samsung have to offer, you get a 6000mAh silicon battery with fast charging, and it doesn't miss out on any extras. In short, this isn't just the best OnePlus phone, but one of the best Android phones you can buy today. </p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9pTnnnNAANcjX3unuTtnhH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pTnnnNAANcjX3unuTtnhH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus overhauled the design of its devices this year, switching to boxier sides — just like every other manufacturer. That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> has beveled edges that made holding and using the phone that much easier, and the weight distribution is ideal. The best part is that although the device has a bigger battery than last year, it is thinner and lighter. <br><br>There's also a new color option with a unique texture at the back. The Midnight Ocean model has a gorgeous blue hue and a microfiber vegan leather back that's unlike anything else available today; it's soft to touch and has a great in-hand feel, and if you're eyeing the device, this is the model to get.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rsBt6ehuKZVWBecL63wtTH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rsBt6ehuKZVWBecL63wtTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> doesn't have beveled sides, and as a result, it isn't as comfortable to hold; the sides tend to dig into your hand, and I recommend using a case with the device. That said, it has aluminum sides, and better durability than last year. While I don't like the design as much as the OnePlus 13, the phone is a smidgen lighter, and unlike last year, you get a flat panel, so it's better in that regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="obpqgqgQdbUA68QWJPGoUH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obpqgqgQdbUA68QWJPGoUH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both devices have the alert slider, an IR blaster, and stereo sound. Water resistance is included as well, and while the OnePlus 13 gets IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, the 13R is limited to IP65. It is good enough against splashes, but doesn't cover immersion in water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VavufYaftRSVojzGhPWVVH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VavufYaftRSVojzGhPWVVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the OnePlus 13 gets a Goodix ultrasonic fingerprint module that's among the best you can get on any phone today, and it is fast and doesn't have any issues. The OnePlus 13R uses an optical module, and while it is also fast, the sensor is located lower on the panel, making it awkward to access. <br><br>I like the design and in-hand feel of the OnePlus 13 over the 13R, but the latter is definitely better than last year's model, and that's a big deal in and of itself.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-display-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rD29xTC98u5N3ZtAHWxNjH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rD29xTC98u5N3ZtAHWxNjH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has a slightly bigger 6.82-inch AMOLED panel going up to 120Hz, with the 13R using the same 6.78-inch panel as the OnePlus 12. Both phones have a quoted maximum of 4500 nits in HDR, but that's a meaningless number; in actual use, the OnePlus 13 gets noticeably brighter outdoors. It isn't to say that the 13R isn't good in its own right, but of the two devices, the OnePlus 13 has the better panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mBvmiKPsUrcVm75A82P2mH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mBvmiKPsUrcVm75A82P2mH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones have vibrant colors and excellent contrast, and stereo sound is detailed enough that you can play games using the onboard audio. On that note, you can play limited titles at 120fps, but there are instances where it leads to increased jitter. There are no issues with streaming content or regular use, with both phones holding up incredibly well in this regard.</p>
<p>Another notable fact is that both devices get flat panels this time. The OnePlus 13 has a slight edge on the sides that makes it a little more immersive, but neither device gets the dual-curved panel that was a mainstay until last year. The glass coating is new as well, with the OnePlus 13 using a custom solution that includes ceramic, and the 13R coming with Gorilla Glass 7i.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-hardware-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aiv467bYtho52GydnZcSjH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aiv467bYtho52GydnZcSjH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has one of the strongest hardware packages available today. It features Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite, and comes with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage as standard, with configurations going up to 1TB. While the 256GB and 512GB variants are sold globally, the 1TB model is limited to China and India. <br><br>After using the OnePlus 13 for over three weeks, I can say that it is one of the fastest phones of 2025. It doesn't have any slowdowns in regular use, the software is optimized incredibly well, and you get a fluidity that's better than just about every other Android interface. It does a great job with gaming as well, and I didn't run into any issues with overheating. There is noticeable throttling at the 30-minute mark, but it doesn't pose much in the way of problems.</p>

<p>In short, this is a terrific package if you need a high-end phone. What's particularly interesting is that all of these statements are valid for the OnePlus 13R as well; while not having the latest hardware, it is powered by last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it is just as good in daily use as well as gaming. <br><br>If anything, I think the OnePlus 13R is a better choice as it gives you flagship internals for a lot less than the OnePlus 13. You get UFS 4.0 storage, and the base model starts with 256GB this time. There's 12GB of RAM as well, and you get the same fluidity with the software. <br><br>You get similar connectivity as well, including Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, AptX HD, dual-band GPS alongside NFC, and new BeaconLink tech that builds on Bluetooth by delivering increased range of up to 300 meters. The only thing missing on the OnePlus 13R is eSIM connectivity; you're limited to dual nano-SIM slots, so if you need this feature, you'll need to get the regular model.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-battery-life-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LkbsMtca8JzNMDxLkmRyfH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LkbsMtca8JzNMDxLkmRyfH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones get 6000mAh batteries, but the OnePlus uses a silicon-carbon anode, delivering better density and the ability to withstand extreme cold. The phone has a dual-cell configuration with two 3000mAh batteries, and as a result, it takes just 38 minutes to fully charge using the 80W standard. The 13R, meanwhile, has a single 6000mAh battery, and it takes close to an hour to charge. <br><br>The 13R misses out on wireless charging as well, which is where the OnePlus 13 excels. The phone gets 15W charging over the Qi standard, and there's 50W AirVOOC as well, thanks to a new magnetic puck. The device doesn't have the requisite magnets, and you'll need to buy a case to enable the tech. <br><br>Although the OnePlus 13R doesn't have the extras, it lasted longer in my testing. While I got a day and a half on both devices, the OnePlus 13R delivered an additional two hours of screen-on time consistently, and that's interesting.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-cameras-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has a trio of 50MP cameras at the back, including a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera, 50MP Sony LYT-600 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. It takes fantastic photos in just about any scenario, and you get photos that are on the same caliber as the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ec3764ba-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The 13R has a 50MP Sony LYT-700 as the main camera, and it's joined by a 50MP Samsung JN5 telephoto lens that goes up to 2x, and an 8MP wide-angle lens. The camera interface is similar to what you get on the OnePlus 13, but there isn't Hasselblad integration, so you miss out on a few shooting modes and effects.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ffb1448e-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>That said, the OnePlus 13R also manages to take standout photos with the main camera, and barring scenes with little to no light, it holds up well. The biggest difference is the versatility; the auxiliary cameras aren't anywhere as good, so you don't get the same caliber of shots at 3x and 6x zoom, and the wide-angle lens doesn't quite deliver the same tonality in low-light situations.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=40eb9d00-cf48-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>Although it may not be as good as the OnePlus 13, I'll note that the main camera on the 13R is great in its own right, and if anything, it is the best shooter in its category.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-software-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="swi3QTAtNdrU36QBCUHqmH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/swi3QTAtNdrU36QBCUHqmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones run OxygenOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, and in my usage, I didn't see any difference in the software. That's a good thing, as it's clear that OnePlus doesn't want to limit its best software features to its flagship. What's noticeable this time is that the interface has better fluidity, and that is the case on both the OnePlus 13 and 13R. <br><br>Obviously, you get the usual AI-focused additions, and they do a decent enough job. Although the interface isn't as minimalist as I'd like, it has an exhaustive set of customization options, and you can tweak the lock screen, notification pane, and home screen to your tastes, and there are plenty of useful utilities around multitasking and gestures. <br><br>As for updates, both phones will pick up four years of Android OS updates alongside six years of software updates. Again, it's good to see the OnePlus 13R get the same software update guarantee as its costlier sibling.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="evyLE4V266hsDrST9GxjgH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/evyLE4V266hsDrST9GxjgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used both devices extensively, and I can say with some confidence that they're among the best OnePlus phones to date. The OnePlus 13 is my go-to recommendation if you need a flagship that has everything: a great design, the best internals, standout cameras, long-lasting battery, and useful software extras. There isn't anything missing on the device, and even though it costs more than last year, you're getting a suite of upgrades that justifies the hike. <br><br>Now, if you don't need the best cameras, the OnePlus 13R is the obvious choice — and a much better value. It may not have the same auxiliary cameras as the OnePlus 13, but the main camera still manages to shoot great photos, and the rest of the hardware isn't that different: you still get top-notch internals, a battery that lasts even longer, an AMOLED panel that's just as good, and the same software. The only limitation is IP65 water resistance, and longer charging times. <br><br>The upside is that the OnePlus 13R costs $300 less than the OnePlus 13, and that is nothing to scoff at. It's an easier recommendation in India, where the device costs just ₹42,999 ($496) — the same as last year. If you want to save some cash and still get great hardware and usable cameras, the OnePlus 13R is my pick. If you need a device that goes up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, then you'll need to get the OnePlus 13.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>The best</strong></em></p><p>This is the best OnePlus phone yet, and I don't say that lightly. It has a better design with increased durability, the latest hardware, amazing cameras, long-lasting battery, and fluid software that's great to use. In short, this is one of the best flagships you can buy in 2025. </p></p>

It basically has the same hardware as last year's OnePlus 12, but is available for much less. The auxiliary cameras may not be as good and the design isn't as comfortable to hold, but these are minor quibbles — as an overall package, the OnePlus 13R is fantastic. </p></p>

<p>While Oura has been around for many years, it can be clearly noted that 2024 was its year of spearheading the smart ring movement. We saw many companies launch a version of what they think a smart ring should be, and of course, the Android giant Samsung even launched the Galaxy Ring.</p><p>I had the opportunity to sit down with the CEO of the Oura Ring, Tom Hale, to speak about the company, what it’s accomplished, and what the future holds, particularly for health and wellness tracking.</p><p>Hale told me it’s refreshing to see competition because it means that “you’re on to something that’s important and valuable.”</p><p>Presently, there are two companies leading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> market, with Oura in the lead. An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.idc.com/2024/10/23/the-future-of-smart-rings/" target="_blank">IDC report on smart rings</a> indicated that Ultrahuman is the second largest brand and that in the full year of 2023, global ring sales totaled 880,000 “with Oura representing 80% and Ultrahuman in second with 12%.” By 2028, IDC forecasts that 3.2 million units will be sold equating to a year-over-year growth of 29.5%.</p><p>Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring last summer, and IDC indicated that at the time of publication (October 2024), the early reception was of moderate interest. But that being said, many of the larger players within the wearables space are watching Samsung Ring sales.</p><p>“[These companies] are exploring the possibility of producing their own smart rings. So should the Galaxy Ring prove to be a success, we will likely see many other players jumping into the market,” the report read.</p>

<p>I’ve been using the Oura Ring for almost two and a half years now. I started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review#:~:text=It's%20durable%2C%20lightweight%2C%20and%20discreet,of%20sight%2C%20out%20of%20mind.">Gen 3</a> and then now I’m using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>. The ring has completely changed the way I think about my health and body, and, more importantly, I’ve noticed that I am able to change and correct my path by doing things based on my stats.</p><p>After using the rings for some time, I think what most people fail to recognize is that a smart ring is a passive device that monitors your health. Yes it has features to track your fitness, but it’s more for monitoring health features like your heart rate, readiness, how you manage your stress, and women’s health.</p><p>Hale expressed that the ultimate vision for the Oura Ring is that it is a health tool for people.</p><p>“Our vision of the future of smart rings is bigger and bolder and badder than just the ring. I think about going beyond the ring,” he said.</p><p>Oura recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2024/Dexcom-and-URA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership/default.aspx">partnered with Dexcom</a>, a glucose biosensing company, to help people improve their metabolic health. The plan is that Dexcom will help “the integration of Dexcom glucose data with vital sign, sleep, stress, heart health and activity data from Oura Ring…to provide users with a more complete picture of overall health.”</p><p>Hale expressed that Oura wants to help people understand more about their health across a wider range of metrics, and understanding glucose is the next step.</p><p>“[It’s] not just going to be one set of data. [It’s] going to be a set of data that is the most complete picture of your health,” he said.</p><p>To me, this is what a smart ring should be. Right now, when I check my Oura app to see my data, I can see and track the kinds of things that have triggered my stress or what has caused me not to have the greatest sleep. I can also track my ovulation, menstrual cycle, heart rate, and body temperature.</p><p>And now, with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-symptom-radar-early-stress-signs-announced">new Symptom Radar feature</a>, my ring can warn me about early signs of strain on my body, such as when I may start feeling under the weather or if I need to take extra rest when major changes take place in my regular data.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-your-data-is-not-a-game-2">Understanding your data is not a game</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rGQs7nag3abwkJeuSmT4VD" name="oura-ring-symptom-radar-hero-wide" alt="Oura introduced its Symptom Radar for the Ring 4 and Gen 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rGQs7nag3abwkJeuSmT4VD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I appreciate the most about the Oura Ring is how it is a passive device. You wear it, it tracks your data and you get to monitor it at your own leisure. There aren’t any major notifications; there aren’t haptics and nothing to make you feel guilty.</p><p>This is why I think smart rings, in general, are not meant to be treated like an Apple Watch or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch</a> but something to be used in tandem with these devices. One of the main purposes of a smartwatch is to help track your fitness and help you stay motivated. The Apple Watch, for example, will ping you to encourage you to close your movement rings for the day.</p><p>But while the gamification of a smartwatch makes sense, it’s not always the most de-stressing component of a wearable. One of the reasons why I stopped wearing an Apple watch was because of this. I was constantly being bombarded with notifications, and it really stressed me out to the point where my anxiety was at its highest. I think one of the reasons why I love the Oura Ring is that it’s incredibly passive and I can go in and check my stats at my own leisure.</p><p>Yes, I do get some notifications from Oura. For example, it'll ping me when it thinks I should start getting ready for bed for optimal sleep and when it thinks I’ve been sitting for too long and suggests stretching my legs. However, I do not find these notifications bothersome or stressful because Oura isn't focused on turning health and wellness into a game, and this is something I think the Oura Ring does much better than smartwatches.</p><p>In fact, Hale stated clearly that the future of Oura isn’t going to be about that gamification of your data and that the company will focus on features like Symptom Radar that help users become more in tune with their bodies and overall wellness.</p><p>“You’ll see us continuing to push innovations, but we always push innovations in the name of health, not in the name of gamification or getting you to engage more frequently…[we want you to] think about where your body is going and to give your body a voice.”</p>

<ul><li>Honor's latest Porsche Design collaboration is coming to Europe next month for €1,799.</li><li>The Porsche Design Honor Magic 7 RSR features a sports car-inspired design and Honor Magic 7 Pro specs.</li><li>The Magic 7 RSR includes a bigger battery than the European variant of the Magic 7 Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor today announced its newest collaboration with Porsche Design: the Porsche Design Honor Magic 7 RSR. It's a premium smartphone that takes cues from Porsche's design language and the Honor Magic 7 Pro. Combined, this makes the Magic 7 RSR an attractive and powerful device — you'll just have to be willing to pay a lump sum for it.</p><p>The Porsche Design Honor Magic 7 RSR will debut across Europe starting Feb. 21, 2025. It'll be available for a starting price of €1,799, which is about $1,850. It's actually cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-review">Honor Magic 6 RSR</a>, since that high-end smartphone launched in Europe last year for a price equivalent to roughly $2,000.</p><p>While the Honor Magic 7 RSR is heavily based on the Magic 7 Pro in terms of hardware, it's specifically built upon the China variant of Honor's flagship. That's because the Magic 7 RSR version ships with a 5,850mAh silicon-carbon battery, whereas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-announced-europe">the standard Magic 7 Pro sold in Europe</a> will feature a smaller 5,270mAh capacity.</p><p>Otherwise, the Magic 7 RSR includes Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset — uniquely equipped to handle on-device AI tasks. Honor's latest phones, including the Magic 7 RSR, come with a mix of on-device and cloud AI features. These include AI Real-Time Rendering and AI Predictive Scheduling Engine, that Honor claims "delivers PC-level graphics."</p><p>The chassis has a line down the back that mimics the body lines of a real Porsche, and the camera housing is meant to resemble sports car headlights, per the brand. Beneath the sleek housing is the same set of cameras as the Honor Magic 7 Pro, headlined by a 50MP, f/1.4 to f/2.0 adjustable aperture sensor with optical image stabilization. That's paired with a 200MP periscope telephoto camera offering 3x optical zoom and a 50MP wide camera with a 122-degree field-of-view.</p><p>When the Honor Magic 7 RSR becomes available for purchase in Europe next month, it'll be a more premium version of the Magic 7 Pro with better looks and a bigger battery. You can get it in Agate Grey and Provence (purple) colorways.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Does your comfortable fluoroelastomer smartwatch band contain toxic chemicals that could transfer through your skin and cause eventual health issues? A scientific study suggests yes, but smartwatch brands like Apple and Google reassured me otherwise — at least about <em>their</em> straps.</p><p>Late last year, the nonprofit American Chemical Society posted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00907#">damning and concerning report</a>, "Presence of Perfluorohexanoic Acid in Fluoroelastomer Watch Bands," by Wicks et al., suggesting that most common watch bands from the last few years have high levels of PFAS and PFHxA compounds with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0704_summary.pdf">potential adverse health effects</a> to the liver, thyroid, and other organs, as well as cancer.</p><p>The news made the rounds on consumer tech sites, and most readers had reason to worry: fluoroelastomer is one of the most common band materials for mainstream watches, along with silicone.</p><p>However, the study didn't say <em>which</em> smartwatch straps they tested had toxic chemicals, except that they purchased 22 bands "across numerous brands and price points" from Amazon and Best Buy in 2023 and that 13 of the 22 tested bands were advertised to contain fluoroelastomer.</p><p>I got my hands on the full paywalled report, which shows how they used particle-induced gamma-ray emission and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine which bands contained fluoride, PFAS, or PFHxA chemicals. The first is an expected ingredient in fluoroelastomer bands; the latter two are likely dangerous if ingested.</p><p>Of the 13 bands advertised as fluoroelastomer, seven had significant PFAS/ PFHxA chemical concentrations, while six had none or safely negligible concentrations. Of the other nine — likely using silicone or other common strap materials — only <em>one</em> had high PFAS/ PFHxA concentrations, and its high fluoride percentage suggests it might be a fluoroelastomer band in disguise.</p><p>What does this tell us? Fluoroelastomer bands aren't <em>inherently</em> dangerous because some brands remove or avoid using harmful chemicals in their manufacturing. The problem is that a majority of brands don't bother to do so, either out of negligence or ignorance of the implications. And we don't know which brands these are.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2316px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="x4H2so59RK3eKNV49PLGQg" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-band-lineup-official-photo.jpg" alt="A press photo of the official Google Pixel Watch 3 bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4H2so59RK3eKNV49PLGQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2316" height="1303" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ingesting or inhaling PFAS compounds is dangerous, but most people aren't going to eat their smartwatch straps. The question is whether or not "dermal absorption" of these chemicals is likely over years of wearing your smartwatch.</p><p>The team behind this ACS report can only answer this question vaguely because "dermal absorption of PFAS is poorly described" in a few scant studies. But because people wear smartwatches for 12+ hours per day, it "poses an opportunity for significant transfer to the dermis and subsequent human exposure."</p><p>They specifically suggest that the "additional sweat contact and open skin pores" caused by wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> for workouts could pose an additional risk — though thankfully, many fitness watches default to sweat-wicking silicone or nylon bands.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vDcBJxp9j24ux72DFqMFiD" name="Samsung-galaxy-watch-7-band-01.jpg" alt="The new official bands for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vDcBJxp9j24ux72DFqMFiD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The study cites tests on mice that indicate PFAS and PFHxA will eventually absorb into your organs and bloodstream if placed on the skin. An "<em>in vitro</em> human skin equivalent model" absorbed "more than 50% of a PFHxA exposure dose."</p><p>Despite all this fearful language, it remains educated conjecture, not a certainty. It's unclear how much PFAS and PFHxA will actually transfer into your body over time and whether it would ever reach high enough levels to pose a health risk.</p><p>The study itself concludes that the findings "highlight a critical need for a more comprehensive exposure study of PFHxA that arises from fluoroelastomer watch bands worn on human skin." They never conclude a direct correlation between wearing a fluoroelastomer band and getting sick.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Some fluoroelastomer bands have toxic chemicals, but we don't know whether they actually transfer through your skin, or if it's enough to cause long-term harm.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A relevant parallel to this fear-inducing study is the recent panic over black plastic cooking utensils and pans with high levels of flame retardants (via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/toxic-black-plastic-kitchen-alternatives/">New York Times</a>), with evidence suggesting that these chemicals could leach into your food over time, especially in the presence of high cooking temperatures and oils.</p><p>That report probably led to some mass-dumping of black plastic spatulas, but it arose later in 2024 that the scientists had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-miscalculation-has-everyone-talking-about-black-plastic-spatulas-again/">made a math error</a> that magnified the issue by 10X, making it look worse than it was. And truly, the only way that the retardants will transfer to your food in significant quantities is if you leave your spatula sitting in hot oil for minutes at a time, which most people naturally wouldn't do.</p><p>My point is you can certainly replace your fluoroelastomer band; there are so many watch band alternatives like silicone, nylon, metal, and leather, if you're concerned. However, until there's concrete evidence of the <em>rate</em> or <em>impact</em> of dermal PFAS/PFHxA absorption in humans, you shouldn't panic about the years you've spent wearing a fluoroelastomer strap.</p><p>Plus, <em>your</em> fluoroelastomer band may not have any PFAS or PFHxA chemicals to begin with!</p>

<p>I emailed my contacts at Apple, Google, and Samsung about this report, asking if they have any comment on the findings, if their customers have reason to switch bands, and if they'll change any manufacturing processes in the future.</p><p>Apple and Google readily shared white papers indicating that they're already aware of the potential dangers and proactively remove PFAS from their smartwatch bands.</p><p>"Pixel Watch bands meet industry standards with regard to PFAS," Google told Android Central. "We proactively limit PFAS in our products and are committed to minimizing PFAS beyond what is required by law." Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sustainability.google/reports/990-00012-00/">white paper</a> references PFAS, saying it would avoid "detectable levels" or up to 25 ppb of the compound in any device.</p><p>Apple's statement echoes Google's, and the company shared its 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_PFAS_Commitment_November-2022.pdf">white paper</a> outlining its PFAS policy.</p><p>"Over a decade ago, we successfully eliminated two PFAS members — PFAS and PFOA — from our products," Apple told Android Central. "Apple has been working to phase out PFAS from all our products and manufacturing processes, which includes engaging with all of our supply chain partners and developing safer alternatives."</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> After publication, a Samsung spokesperson reached out with the following statement: "At Samsung, customer safety and satisfaction are our top priorities. We remain committed to using safe and sustainable materials, while maintaining high-quality products."</p><p>Ideally, this would mean Samsung doesn't use these compounds either, though the statement doesn't say so explicitly. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/sustainability/policy-file/AYVhebWqCXoAIx95/Standards_for_Control_of_Substances_Used_in_Products_EN.pdf">Samsung Electronics Standards for Control of Substances used in products</a>, PFAS is listed among "Potentially Risk Substances" and PFHxA in its "Restricted Substances" list with a 25㎍/kg maximum.</p><p>However, the latter lists July 2026–2027 as the implementation date to restrict PFHxA, so Samsung's "skin contact textiles" may currently use them, with the goal of eradicating them in the next couple of years.</p><p>At the very least, it's comforting that the biggest smartwatch brands have recognized the dangers of toxic compounds in smartwatch straps and taken steps to remove them. It's possible that two of the PFAS-free fluoroelastomer bands in the 2023 study came from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch S9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>If your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> comes from another brand, I still urge you not to worry prematurely. But most brands offer an easy way to swap out straps if you don't want to stress about it, and we do have guides on alternative bands — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Galaxy Watch 7 bands</a> — if you want to shop around.</p>

<p>Practically every Sci-fi movie shows someone using a futuristic computer with a holographic display controlled by a wave of their hands. However, the practical use of these kinds of interfaces is extremely limited without one of our major senses: touch. While an sEMG band makes it possible to "feel" virtual buttons and objects via a built-in haptic engine, Meta has a much larger vision than that.</p><p>This is about ensuring that XR is as mind-blowing as the original iPhone when a proper pair of AR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> is finally commercially available. We got a glimpse of that with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> at September's Meta Connect conference, and it's clear this band is the way Meta plans users to interact with all future AR glasses from the company.</p><p>The band is worn like a smartwatch but isn't used to tell time or track your heart rate. Instead, it helps make hand tracking more accurate and, most importantly, subtle, by sensing muscle movements and translating them into actions.</p><p>But the sEMG band isn't just an alternative input method. It's more private than voice input — especially in public places — and it allows you to keep your attention forward instead of on a physical device like a phone or keyboard. That's important in a world where people are constantly together but never <em>present</em>. It's the perfect way to control the next-generation pair of Meta smart glasses, and that's exactly what Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/quest/surface-emg-wrist-white-paper-reality-labs/">newly published white paper</a> details.</p>

<p>Meta's first major AR glasses prototype, Meta Orion, uses this kind of sEMG band and Meta fully believes it's a requirement for true AR smart glasses products scheduled to debut this year. Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen. It can work, but the experience isn't very good.</p><p>I've seen this kind of band referred to as a "neural interface" before but I think that's really overselling it. Yes, the band can detect the electrical signals in your arm muscles to better understand how you want to interact with virtual objects, but it can't read your mind. If anything, neural interface makes the band sound creepy when it's really not.</p><p>In my demo, I was able to almost effortlessly scroll though song tracks by rubbing my thumb forward or backward on my index finger. It felt almost like I was using some kind of fidget roller to control an iPod, but no physical object was in my hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1523px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YDydXNNsTRucGccbjJp8Sf" name="meta-semg-band-analysis" alt="A photo of a Meta sEMG band third-generation prototype with explanations of its anatomy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YDydXNNsTRucGccbjJp8Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1523" height="857" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Scrolling though an Instagram feed was similarly simple, although that required a little more of my attention than Meta talks about in this white paper.</p><p>The sEMG band is vital for next generation virtual interfaces because it allows full input without a touchscreen or a set of cameras that can see your hands. That second part is most important because, if companies like Meta are going to launch a successful pair of smart glasses with a display, they'll need to cut out as much "fluff" technology as possible to make the glasses small and comfortable.</p><p>As Meta points out in the white paper, being able to control a pair of smart glasses even when your hands are full is a sort of holy Grail of device input. It could easily replace the smartphone experience because it's even more effortless, and we all know people love convenience and ease.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Being able to control a pair of smart glasses even when your hands are full is a sort of holy Grail of device input.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Because it doesn't require the use of a camera to detect movement, it's not subject to the same sort of tech bias that cameras can suffer from. There have been many examples of camera-controlled interfaces over the years that didn't perform as well for people with darker skin tones, but the sEMG won't have this problem.</p><p>The sEMG band I wore was extremely comfortable as it was made with stretchy, breathable fabric and fit very comfortably around my wrist. Unlike traditional EMG medical devices, it's completely non-invasive and feels no different from wearing a smartwatch. If anything, it's more comfortable than a smartwatch because the weight is evenly distributed all around the band.</p><p>Because you're not holding anything in your hand, using an sEMG band with something like smart glasses is more ergonomic than a smartphone. There's a reason "text neck" is a recognized medical condition and this could very well solve that problem entirely.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>This is not a "brain-reading device" and cannot read your thoughts. It also cannot beam Zuck's thoughts (or anyone else's) into your head.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A full-on pair of smart glasses like Meta Orion naturally have cameras built in that can track the environment around them, similar to a VR headset. These cameras can also be used for hand tracking, but hand tracking is usually a bit more of an active input type since the cameras actually have to be able to <em>see</em> your hands.</p><p>An sEMG band helps augment this by providing a secondary input based on wrist muscle movement. The band can detect the electrical impulses in your muscles and understands hundreds of different gestures because of it. It can even detect slight movements, allowing you to be extremely precise with input. The animated image above shows a real hand alongside what</p><p>Meta stresses that this is not a "brain-reading device" and that it cannot read your thoughts. As I said before, I thought it was a bit much when Mark Zuckerberg referred to it as a "neural interface" back at Connect. It's not. It also cannot beam Zuck's thoughts into your head which, apparently, some people were worried about or they wouldn't have mentioned it in the white paper.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2458px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WpvXwse54duSGhfUix3cAh" name="meta-semg-band-compared-to-samsung-galaxy-ring" alt="A photo of a Samsung Galaxy Ring taken by Nicholas Sutrich next to an illustration of a Meta sEMG band provided by Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpvXwse54duSGhfUix3cAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2458" height="1383" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich, Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The sensors come in contact with the skin and read electrical signals in your wrist muscles in the same non-invasive way a smartwatch reads your pulse.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta also stresses that the sEMG is non-invasive which is important since clinical EMG technology <em>is</em> invasive. The inside of the band looks a lot like a smart ring, including sensors that slightly protrude. The version of the sEMG band I used was the third generation of its kind and looks substantially sleeker than the first two generations, both of which looked more like a smartwatch than anything else.</p><p>The sensors come in contact with the skin and read electrical signals in your wrist muscles much in the same way a smartwatch reads your pulse. They don't provide any sort of electrical stimulation or feedback. Rather, they are just used to read muscle movements and infer more accurate hand tracking data.</p><p>These types of sEMG bands are more attractive for mainstream adoption for a bevy of reasons. Outside of looking nice and being fully customizable, they don't look any different from a cloth or leather wristband that someone might wear to complete the look of an outfit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-ui-02.jpg" alt="A view of the multitasking UI inside Meta Orion AR Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also feels incredibly natural to interact with virtual interfaces when using an sEMG band thanks to the haptic feedback engine inside. This motor can vibrate and provide physical feedback based on what you touch, similar to how a virtual button on a smartphone display can feel more real when it vibrates correctly.</p><p>Touching floating buttons that don't exist can feel very strange on a Meta Quest headset because there's no feedback, but an sEMG band solves this problem. It's a huge win for the concept of floating virtual screens and UIs and would be a legitimate replacement for a tablet in many scenarios.</p><p>Meta doesn't have a timetable for when such a band would make it to market, but I'd be willing to hedge my bets that we'll see one alongside the launch of Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-ray-ban-meta-ar-glasses-are-getting-a-visual-upgrade">first pair of smartglasses with a display</a> sometime this year.</p>

<p>Samsung's S25 leaks are coming in hot as we are exactly one week away from the Unpacked event set for January 22. This time, we get to see high-quality images of the alleged S25 series.</p><p>The photos come from prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1879269291100647721">Evan Blass,</a> and they look like official promotional posters from Samsung, painting a picture of how the cameras on these devices will likely appear.</p><p>The first image shows the two devices, which seem to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> and S25 Plus models, in deep blue and silver color variants. The image gives us a close-up of the trio's cameras set up on the back, with black rims surrounding the cameras. (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/14/samsung-galaxy-s25-camera-design-leak/">9to5Google</a>).</p>

<p>The second image shows the S25 Ultra's design, a display showcasing thin bezels with rounded corners, and the first-ever look at the S Pen in the right corner of the product poster. The back of the device is shown with its rumored four-camera array and lenses that could have black rims. However, it is the first close-up of the lens with its new black rims.</p><p>Last week saw massive S25 leaks that gave us full renders of the series' trio along with the supposed spec sheet, leaving little to nothing to the imagination.</p><p>The Ultra is rumored to grab a 6.9-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the device could see a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide-angle camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto. The S25 and S25 Plus could see a 6.2-inch Full HD+ display and a 6.7-inch display, respectively. They will likely have a triple camera array featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultrawide-angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens.</p><p>Both handsets will apparently have a 12MP selfie shooter on the front.</p>

<p>Additionally, within the image, a new AI feature was spotted that is said to come with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>. The screen displays an interactive bar at the bottom, dubbed “Now Bar,” with the “Now Brief” prompt visible that reads "Get today's highlight."</p><p>Not much has been revealed about these features however, Samsung put out a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/the-first-step-towards-true-ai-companion"> blog post</a> recently stating this feature will be the "defining element" of the new UI. Now Bar will give you a brief of your day (aka Now Brief), which is said to integrate into everyday actions and the most-used apps on the lock screen. The bar will give users personalized suggestions with regard to entertainment, directions to their next meeting, or even help with communicating in different languages.</p><p>Samsung S24 users got a little taste of what the new One UI 7 is capable of as the third beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">rolled out </a>for them last week.</p><p>While we're seeing leaks come out in full swing, it's important to note that these features may or may not show up on the official device.

<ul><li>Google Home's Public Preview environment is preparing to deliver an update that expands support, features, and device control.</li><li>Enrolled testers will soon experiment with third-party Matter support for smart locks and the addition of Nest Protect CO/smoke alarms.</li><li>A recent Public Preview test brought "Gemini in Assistant" for Google's speakers, which lets users call out to the AI for answers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is beginning to push the start of another Public Preview update that opens the doors to more device support and Matter.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Introducing-new-support-for-smoke-amp-CO-and-locks-in-Google-Home-app/ba-p/669640">community post</a>, the Google Home Public Preview is preparing to rollout for CO/smoke alarms, smart locks through Matter, and Control settings. Beginning with Matter support, Google states it will soon open its doors to "new partners" with "more compatibility" in the Home app. Of course, this is thanks to the new smart home standard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a>.</p><p>More specifically, the post states those enrolled in the app's Public Preview will begin noticing "feature enhancements" for third-party Matter smart locks. Those new features include "Passcode Management."</p><p>Household managers will soon find a complete, all-encompassing view of who has a passcode to a lock and their access status. Moreover, the company states that, as a manager, you will have the ability to set personal automations and see a "robust" history of events. Additionally, managers can create "guest passcodes" for people who require temporary access.</p><p>This feature is said to rollout out "this week" for Public Preview users on Android. Those on iOS will have to wait a little longer.</p><p>Next, Google is expanding the scope of its included Nest Protect devices to its CO and smoke alarms. As it arrives "this week," testers will find a new view for their alarms that include a general overview of a room's status. More importantly, if there is a situation and a camera is present, users can view that room directly to see where the fire or emergency is and take action.</p><p>The rest of the Nest Protect support includes the following:</p>
<ul><li>Receive emergency and heads-up notifications for smoke and carbon monoxide</li><li>Get critical status alerts like battery health or device issues</li><li>Modify your configuration: change system-wide and alarm-specific settings</li><li>E911 calling for Nest Aware subscribers (US only)- If you are a Nest Aware subscriber in the US, you can use the Google Home app to quickly contact an emergency call center close to your home, even if you’re not home.</li></ul>

<p>The Public Preview's upcoming addition of better control settings in the app are mostly quality of life changes for "one-tap entry" and "automatic locking." For the former, Google states users can choose this option, which will eliminate the need for entering in a passcode. Instead, users will need to tap lock or unlock using the app. Automatic locking will let users set a timer for a specific lock, letting it know how long it should remain open before locking down (literally).</p><p>Push notifications for lock events are also included, as well as a "Vacation mode" to give your smart locks even more security.</p><p>A recent Public Preview update for Google Home from December involved a strong look at "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-public-preview-gemini-in-assistant-test">Gemini in Assistant</a>." The AI concerned the company's smart Nest devices like the Nest Audio or the Nest Speaker Mini 2nd Gen. Testers could converse with the AI through these devices and receive answers about a range of topics. Essentially, it acts similar to the Gemini experience on your phone.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-google-home-integration-public-preview-rollout">Gemini update</a> for Public Preview users included bringing it into the fold for your smart home accessories. Users could ask Gemini to close their blinds in a specific room and more, which sees the new AI model slowly replacing the brand's Assistant.</p>

<hr>
<p>A major Samsung leak seemingly involves its highly rumored "Slim" variant to the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>Clear renders of the assumed Galaxy S25 Slim were discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1879599398625374691">OnLeaks</a> in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-shows-off-ultra-thin-design-exclusive-first-look/">SmartPrix</a>. The images suggest the device will have a pretty expected design as the Galaxy S25 Slims resembles what we've seen rumored for the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus. Strangely, the rumors don't purport the phone's display size; however, it does mention that the screen is completely flat.</p><p>The provided renders also show that the sides of the phone have the potential to be flat, as well.</p><p>What the publication highlights after is the supposed thinness of the phone, which is allegedly 6.4mm without factoring in the camera bump. The tipster's discovery suggests the phone's measurements, which are reportedly 159x76x6.4mm.</p><p>The post purports that the Galaxy S25 Slim will be roughly "1.6mm narrower, 3.8mm shorter, and 1.8mm thinner" than the upcoming S25 Ultra.</p><p>Internally, rumors suggest Samsung will keep the Qualcomm trend and place the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> inside the S25 Slim. The SoC lends strength to a device's on-device AI, tasks for gaming and more, but it also bolsters a device's cameras.</p><p>That rolls us into Slim's supposed triple vertical camera array on a "glass back" panel. The renderings show that Samsung might deploy the same style of camera lenses that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-series-rendering-design-leak">we've seen leaked</a> for its other Galaxy S25 phones. The publication claims the phone will utilize three cameras: a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 50MP ALoP telephoto camera with 3.5x zoom.</p>

<p>Other rumored specifications include the S25 Slim's 12GB of RAM. The renders show that Samsung will place the USB-C charging port and speaker on the bottom of the phone, to no one's surprise. Additionally, the latest renderings/rumors fail to mention a battery size.</p><p>The post simply states the S25 Slim will feature a "larger battery" that's over 3,050mAh.</p><p>These renders surface five days after the Galaxy S25 Slim was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-geekbench-test">reportedly spotted on Geekbench</a>. The listing seemingly doubles down on what's been rumored today with the device's 12GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The Geekbench data shows that the phone will likely run One UI 7 (Android 15), which we're also expecting.</p><p>What's more, the rumors mention Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">ALoP camera technology</a>. This is something the company discussed last November, which is something that could positively affect the future of Galaxy phone camera modules. Putting it plainly, ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) places the lenses "horizontally" inside the module, instead of vertically, which saves on a massive camera bump.</p><p>With Samsung in its thin phone era, this seems like a smart move. Though, it doesn't seem like the ALoP tech will be implemented across the entire array.</p><p>Rumors have continuously suggested the phone <em>could </em>debut sometime in Q2 2025. That gives us a window between April and June.</p><p>For now, we have the flagship trio to look forward to on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">January 22 at Unpacked</a>.
