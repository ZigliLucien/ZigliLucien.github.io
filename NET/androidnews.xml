The phone was recently spotted in a leaked video showing off a bit of the device and what looked like One UI 7 running on it. Now, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-exclusive-3503414/">series of images</a> has emerged that reveal more of the device as well as One UI 7.</p><p>As expected, the alleged Galaxy S25 Ultra features a boxier design with more rounded corners and a flat display. We also get a look at the bottom of the phone, which sports the USB-C port, speaker and mic, SIM card slot, and the S Pen tucked into the phone.</p>

<p>The leak also provided screenshots of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">One UI 7</a> in action, showing more or less what we've seen in previous demoes and leaks. The UI appears much more bubbly than before with large rounded icons and a new quick settings layout.</p>

This will enable T-Mobile users to utilize Starlink satellites to access basic network capabilities like texting and eventually voice and data. The move was announced as a way to effectively end dead zones.</p><p>The FCC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-1193A1.pdf">says</a> this kind of connectivity will support "critical public interest benefits," which may refer to the recent hurricane that saw many without access to cellular connectivity. In fact, the two companies were granted approval to temporarily provide the service to those affected by the hurricane, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">highlighted the need for this kind of tech</a>.</p><p>The approval has some restrictions that will limit Starlink and T-Mobile's ability to provide voice and other more bandwidth-hungry services, but things are finally getting off the ground with more ubiquitous satellite connectivity services.</p>

This week, both companies presented closing arguments in a final effort to sway the court in their favor.</p><p>“Google is once, twice, three times a monopolist,” Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum told the judge (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/technology/google-advertising-monopoly.html">The New York Times</a>). “These are the markets that make the free and open internet possible.”</p><p>The U.S. government is arguing that Google used its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008 to dominate and push out the competition, as the company now controls 87% of the Ad Tech market. It's said that this has caused websites to potentially lose out on money they could have made selling through rivals, and the result could be that news outlets and websites may be forced to charge consumers to access content.</p><p>Google's lawyer refuted the claims by noting that the company isn't pushing out competition but has reacted in response to competition by innovating its product.</p>

Finally, users can save screenshots, images, and text in a journal and their phone will "remember" them, using contextual AI to pull details from images and summarize anything that gets saved.

I bought three of these streaming boxes over the years, and while they still hold up incredibly well, I wanted something that had AV1 codec, and that led me to Mecool's KM2 Plus Deluxe. <br><br>Awkward naming aside, the KM2 Plus Deluxe is the ultimate streaming box. It runs Android TV 11, has 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and is powered by an Amlogic S905X4, one of the fastest platforms in this category. It has full access to the Play Store, and you can set up all the streaming services you use — including Netflix. It has Chromecast built-in, and acts as a Cast target if you need to stream content from your phone or any other device. <br><br>Best of all, it has HDR10+ and Dolby Vision integration, and if you're like me and have an extensive library of HDR content, this is the streaming device for you. It has the AV1 codec as well, and it does a great job with HDR content in YouTube. And with the Cyber Monday deal, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM2-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0D62YKJ2S">get it for just $119</a>, $30 less than its usual selling price and $80 less than the Shield TV Pro.</p>

<p>✅Recommended if: You need a streaming box that's powerful, and has all the latest codecs. The KM2 Plus Deluxe does a great job with Dolby Vision content, and the interface is among the most fluid I used.</p><p>❌Skip this deal if: You don't like the Android TV interface, and you need AI-assisted image upscaling.</p>
<p>The only problem I had with the KM2 Plus Deluxe when I switched to it earlier in the year was lack of Dolby Vision, but that was addressed by a software update. The streaming box doesn't have any issues with HDR or Dolby Vision content in Netflix or YouTube, and the interface is among the most fluid in this category. <br><br>You get USB ports on the left, allowing you to easily attach an external drive. The biggest feature missing is the ability to upscale SD videos; this is something the Shield TV Pro does incredibly well, and you just don't get that on any other device. Outside of that, the KM2 Plus Deluxe does everything I need in an Android TV streaming box, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM2-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0D62YKJ2S">$119 pricing</a> makes it a value-focused alternative to the Shield TV Pro.</p>

Sadly, that model isn&apos;t on sale for Cyber Monday, but you can still get the next best thing for nearly half the price! The superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review">Amazfit GTR Mini</a> rivals the battery life of the newer Amazfit Balance. You can score an excellent 15% discount on the GTR Mini while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWF33MMB"><strong>Cyber Monday deal lasts on Amazon</strong></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazfit-gtr-mini-smartwatch-32-5-stainless-steel-black/6579497.p"><strong>Best Buy for $84.99</strong></a>.</p><p>The round-shaped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit smartwatch</a> looks just like a cool wristwatch, but don’t be fooled, there are tons of tracking and premium features inside. Along with more than 120 sports modes, heart rate tracking, GPS, sleep monitoring, and compatibility with an AI fitness app, the GTR Mini can somehow manage to run for up to two weeks per charge.</p><p>Thankfully, Amazfit uses standard quick-release connectors, so compatible bands are super easy and cheap to find. Oh, and did I mention it’s also 5ATM water-resistant so you can swim with it, too?</p>

<p>Not only does this stunning smartwatch run for up to 14 days on a single charge, but it can track all your workouts, deliver notifications, measure your sleep duration and quality, blood oxygen, and stress, and look as great on your wrist whether you’re working out or dining out. At this Cyber Monday price, it’s an absolute no-brainer.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWF33MMB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="84c13607-8bef-4685-80ef-821d18ea959a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazfit GTR Mini: $99.99" data-dimension48="Amazfit GTR Mini: $99.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a beginner who is just getting into the world of fitness, health, and wellness tracking and who tends to get daunted by complicated menus and apps.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need something more robust with advanced features and third-party app access.</p><p>Along with the “unbelievable battery life,” I absolutely loved the bright AMOLED display, advanced GPS (perfect for runners and cyclists), preset replies for messages, breadth of sports modes, and the ability to summon Alexa from your wrist during my testing for my review.</p><p>Another factor that I admire about the GTR Mini is that it is super thin and lightweight, so you won’t even know you’re wearing it. The Zepp OS 2.0 interface is clean and easy to use, with no learning curve, something someone unfamiliar with using smartwatches will appreciate. It has some limitations though, including no third-party app support nor a speaker or mic (when you summon Alexa, your phone needs to be connected and nearby), but you might not even care. </p><p>Sure, this smartwatch isn’t the newest, most powerful and feature-rich smartwatch you can buy. But for beginners looking to kickstart their fitness or health and wellness journey, it’s a good budget option that doesn’t act like a budget watch. And at <strong>just $84.99 during the ongoing Cyber Monday weekend sales</strong>, it’s worth the investment. When you’re ready to move up to something more premium, hand this one down to a friend or family member and they’ll love using it, too.</p>

I tested a half-dozen in the last 12 months, and the one I ended up using the most is GameSir's G8 Plus. Unlike most mobile gaming controllers, the G8 Plus has full-size buttons and triggers, and that makes all the difference while gaming. <br><br>It also has hall effect thumbsticks, so you'll never see stick drift. The vibration motor has excellent feedback, and it's just enjoyable to use the thumbsticks and triggers. Best of all, the controller pairs over Bluetooth, so it works with just about any device — I used it with my iPhone 16 Pro Max, a dozen or so Android phones, foldables, and several tablets. You can use it with a Switch as well, and the versatility is a key selling point. <br><br>The G8 Plus retails for $99, but for Cyber Monday, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">available for $63</a> — that's a standout value when you consider just what you're getting.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a controller that's great to hold and use. The full-size triggers and thumbsticks give the G8 Plus a distinct advantage, and I didn't notice any fatigue even after extended Balatro sessions. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a mobile controller that's portable, or if you have a phone with a massive camera island.</p>
<p>The design of the G8 Plus is a big differentiator; the full-size design with the ergonomic body makes holding and using the controller enjoyable. This was a problem with most other controllers I tested, but thankfully not an issue on the G8 Plus. The thumbsticks are among the best in this category, as are the triggers at the back. You get a decent amount of customizability with both, and there are custom buttons at the back that can be configured to in-game actions with relative ease. <br><br>As it has Bluetooth, it pairs seamlessly with just about any device — I didn't see any issues whatsoever in this area. The left side slides out to accommodate phones and tablets, and the soft rubber bridge ensures the controller doesn't scratch your device. Battery longevity wasn't a problem, and there's a USB-C port that lets you charge the controller while it's in use. <br><br>If you're mulling a controller that lets you play games on your phone and tablet with ease, the G8 Plus is easily one of the best around, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">coming in at $63</a>, it is one of the best deals this Cyber Monday.</p>

It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-300W-000mAh-Power-Bank/dp/B0CJY37RT3">now on sale for $118</a>, and I think that&apos;s a terrific price. When I need something smaller, I just use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode 20,000mAh power bank</a> — it goes up to 130W, has adequate charge, and is easily portable (and it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">$60 now</a>).</p><p>The biggest issue with UGREEN power banks (and most other brands) is that they don&apos;t include custom charging tech. While both models I listed above deliver 100W of power over the USB PD standard, they can&apos;t do the same with OnePlus&apos;s 100W SuperVOOC and Vivo&apos;s 120W FlashCharge tech. This is where Anker comes into the equation; the accessory manufacturer picked up a SuperVOOC license back in 2021, and it&apos;s finally putting that to good use.</p><p>Anker&apos;s 27,650mAh Prime Power Bank goes up to 250W in total, and it does 140W via a single port using the USB PD 3.1 standard. But that&apos;s not the most interesting part; it also has a USB-A port that goes up to 65W, delivering 10V at 6.5A. If those figures look familiar, that&apos;s because it corresponds to SuperVOOC&apos;s charging tech. Basically, you can use this power bank&apos;s USB-A port to charge all OnePlus phones at 65W, and that&apos;s a unique differentiator. </p><p>The power bank usually retails for $179, and it has picked up its first discount now, going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">down to $119 on Amazon</a> (with a $10 coupon). That is a terrific value for any power bank in general, but when you consider the addition of SuperVOOC charging, it makes this the best power bank deal around.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want the best power bank money can buy today. Anker&apos;s power bank charges just about any device, and with a 27,650mAh battery, you don&apos;t need to worry about it running out. The obvious highlight is the ability to charge OnePlus devices at 65W, but even if you don&apos;t need it, this is a fantastic power bank.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a smaller power bank.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to like on the Anker Prime 27,650mAh power bank. It has dual USB-C ports, with each able to hit 140W individually over USB PD 3.1. There&apos;s a USB-A port which handles SuperVOOC charging, going up to 65W. With both USB-C ports in use, you get 100W out of one port and 140W out of the other, and it has a total power budget of 250W when all three ports are active.</p><p>It has a vertical design, great build quality, and you get a panel that shows real-time charging details. The power bank recharges the internal battery at 170W, and coming in at 99.5Wh, it is just under the maximum allowed for travel (100Wh). I got started with this power bank three months ago, and honestly, I haven&apos;t felt the need to use anything else.</p><p>I use several OnePlus and OPPO phones, and the ability to charge these devices at 65W via a power bank makes things incredibly convenient. I tested the power bank with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. With any other power bank, these devices charge at 10W, so to be able to go up to 65W is fantastic. </p><p>Even if you don&apos;t have a OnePlus device, this is easily the best power bank you can get today, and the fact that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">down to just $119</a> makes it an instant buy.</p>

With HDD sizes increasing by a considerable amount, I decided to use 18TB and 24TB drives in my NAS, but the secondary NAS (a DiskStation DS1019+) that&apos;s now being used to back up vital data (photos, documents, and so on) is still going strong, and it has 12TB and 16TB IronWolf drives.</p><p>The DS1019+ has been in constant use for the last five years, and the IronWolf drives housed within are close to hitting 40,000 hours of use. When I set up the NAS back in 2019, I had no idea the drives would last this long, and it&apos;s great to see the HDDs exceed Seagate&apos;s usage ceiling. While this NAS is not being used as the primary server any longer, I still have plenty of valuable data on it (which is thankfully backed up elsewhere), and I&apos;m now just interested in seeing how long these drives actually last.</p><p>If you&apos;ve got a home server and are thinking of picking up additional drives, the 12TB IronWolf HDD I&apos;m using is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF">now down to $199 on Amazon</a>. That was what it went down to last year as well, but the deal ran out at the retailer, and if that&apos;s the case, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/seagate-ironwolf-st12000vn0008-12tb/p/1JW-001N-00027">same discount at Newegg</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1634056-REG/seagate_st12000vn0008_12tb_ironwolf_3_5_internal.html">B&H Photo</a>.</p>

<p>A good NAS HDD needs to do two things: store data reliably, and last an extended duration even with 24/7 use. The 12TB IronWolf drive I'm using in the DS1019+ has been in constant use over the last five years, and it's still chugging along without any issues. If that isn't a strong enough endorsement for this drive, I don't know what is.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="caba7d1c-da6e-4c7a-84fb-f6b5a82ca421" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$199 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I think the 8TB IronWolf is a great starting point if you don&apos;t need too much storage, and the drive is a good choice if you have a 2-bay NAS. The drive is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF">now down to $149</a>, which is $10 more than what it was this time last year, but still a decent $30 savings on its retail price. The 12TB drive is my go-to recommendation, and I&apos;ve used four of these over the course of the last five years to good effect.</p><p>The 16TB IronWolf Pro is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B0B94PNF7P">once again down to $249</a>, and if you&apos;re considering this drive, I&apos;d recommend upgrading to the 24TB model instead, which is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CSPCFKR9">better deal at $399</a>. With 24TB of storage on a single drive, you don&apos;t need to worry about storage for several years.</p><p>Regardless of what storage variant you get, all IronWolf drives come with long-term reliability, spin at 7200rpm, and include custom software with vibration resistance — necessary in a NAS server. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF">12TB IronWolf HDD for $199</a> is my pick thanks to the value you&apos;re getting, but I&apos;ve also used the 16TB variants, and I&apos;m now getting started with the 22TB option.</p>

While the excitement has fizzled out, that's actually a good thing because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKM287V2"><strong>at less than $215</strong></a>, this is the cheapest we've seen Razer's first and only handheld.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday"><em><strong>Amazon's Black Friday sale is LIVE —  see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/new-razer-edge-android-cloud-gaming-console">Razer Edge</a> was announced with much excitement, as it's basically an Android tablet paired with the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0CCT2Y8BN">Razer Kishi V2 Pro</a> controller. Not only that, but Razer also utilized a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, complete with a 144Hz refresh rate. Because of its unique design, this means you can actually swap out the controller if you aren't a fan of the V2 Pro, or just upgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CXGMPLWK">Kishi Ultra</a>.</p><p>At the time, it was also one of the more powerful Android devices on the market, courtesy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-g3x-gen-1-gaming-platform-announce">Snapdragon G3X Gen 1</a>, which was essentially a gaming-optimized version of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. With this, you have an all-in-one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handheld</a> that still manages to put at least some of the competition to shame.</p>

<p>The original appeal of the Edge was to provide a dedicated handheld that was great for both cloud gaming and your favorite Android games. Its only major competition was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-launch">Logitech G Cloud</a>, which was severely underpowered, despite offering better ergonomics.</p><p>Part of the problem for Razer was that it kind of fumbled the launch, as it offered two versions: one with Wi-Fi and the other with cellular connectivity. When it was officially introduced, Razer claimed both models would feature the same list of specs, however, it was later revealed that the Wi-Fi model actually featured less RAM.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that the Wi-Fi version originally retailed for $400, so actually, you're saving almost $200 on the Razer Edge. Although the price has hovered around the $250 mark for the better part of the year.</p>

<p>Out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Kindle e-readers</a> today, the Kids Paperwhite Edition (12th Gen) is high up on our list. So far, we've only reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-11th-gen-review">11th-Gen Kindle Paperwhite Kids</a> — it's hard to keep up with every release — but our parent reviewer loved it for its two-month battery life and distraction-free software. The 12th-Gen tablet lasts <em>three</em> months per charge, has the upgraded display tech for better contrast, and adds another 0.2 inches of display space. Basically, what was already great got even better!</p>

<p>The best part of buying either Kindle is that it's limited. Sure, you can buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Pro-Tablet-Hello-Teal-32GB/dp/B0D1DMSV9G"><strong>Kindle Fire HD 8 Kids Pro for 50% off</strong></a> so they can stream content as well as read, but I think it's pretty obvious what'll be more appealing to a kid if both options are presented! Giving them tablet time with an e-reader ensures their brain gets a break from YouTube endorphins, so they can focus on learning and imagination instead!</p><p>That being said, if you want to give your kid the most possible content, from shows to books, the Kindle Fire deals are more affordable at the moment!

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you're looking for an easy-to-use smart display that's compatible with the Alexa ecosystem and a wide range of smart home devices; you're looking for something that works with popular streaming channels like Amazon or Apple Music, Prime Video, Netflix, and more;  you want a smart display that's easy to use for video calling.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a smart display that can be rotated, like the Echo Show 10; you're looking for something even more affordable than this deal can offer.</p><p>The 2023 Amazon Echo 8 is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-echo-show">best Amazon Echo Show</a>, featuring everything most users want in a home-integrated smart display. We like this Echo's mid-sized display, its auto-framing camera and noise reduction features for video calling, and the 1,280x800 resolution, which is the same as the 10 but offers a higher pixel ratio per inch. Amazon's Echo Show products also come with a physical camera shutter, as well as a physical off button for the microphone and camera, making it a decent privacy pick compared to some competitors.</p><p>There are a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-echo-show-8-3rd-gen-vs-echo-show-8-2nd-gen">differences between the second and third-gen Echo Show 8 </a>beyond the size, including a slightly faster chipset, a front-facing camera that's built into the center, and spatial audio processing that wasn't included on previous releases. It also features a slightly higher price tag, though that won't be a problem for those taking advantage of this deal.</p><p>The new version also includes support for a wider range of other smart home devices, including those from Zigbee, Matter, and Thread.</p>

In just the past few months, I've gone through about 20 laptops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> combined. But there's one thing that has been a staple of my tech EDC (everyday carry) for more than a year, and it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/review-ugreen-145w-25000mah-power-bank-review">UGREEN 145W power bank</a>. No matter how lightly I'm packing, this 25,000mAh portable charger comes with me. To that end, I've stuck this thing in my back pocket before going into sporting events at Madison Square Garden — that's how much I can't live without it.</p><p>If you're in the market for a power bank, I've got great news: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BJQ7F16T/"><strong>the UGREEN 145 power bank is down to just $66 at Amazon. That's thanks to a 25% off Black Friday deal and a $10 coupon.</strong></a> Considering that this same power bank retailed for $150 when I reviewed it, this makes for one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday and Cyber Monday's</a> most underrated deals. It's so good, I'm not even sure you need to be in the market for a power bank — no one should pass this up.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a high-capacity portable charger; you want a power bank that can charge everything from your earbuds to your phone, tablet, and laptop; you want a versatile and feature-rich charger with multiple ports, port types, and an LED display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a compact and easily-pocketable solution (the UGREEN power bank does fit in some large pant or coat pockets, though it's a tight fit); you want a power bank with wireless charging.</p>
<p>There are a few things that I love about this charger, starting with its size and capacity. It's a 25,000mAh power bank, and when you consider that most phones have a capacity of mAh of around 5,000, that's a ton of power. I can charge most phones at least a few times, and charge tablets and laptops from 0% to 100% with no problems. That means I don't have to stress about charging anymore; I simply make sure the UGREEN 145W power bank is always charged, and it'll take care of all my devices with one USB-A port and two USB-C ports.</p><p>The UGREEN 145W power bank is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best portable chargers</a> out there because it has <em>both </em>capacity and speed. It supports 145W total power delivery, so even power-hungry devices can stay powered up by this charger. Additionally, I think this power bank has the perfect display. It shows the power bank's state-of-charge in simple LED form, which is better than the unnecessary and wasteful LCD screens on some portable chargers.</p><p>Throw it all together, and it's shocking that you get this much power and features in a power bank that can still fit in my back pocket. At $66, I'd recommend anyone who has an Android smartphone or a tablet buy the UGREEN 145W power bank for Black Friday.</p>
