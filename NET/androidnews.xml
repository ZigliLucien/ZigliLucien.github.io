<p>Google's latest flagship has been out for several months now, and with the Black Friday sales approaching, many folks are on the hunt for the best Pixel 9 deals. Whether you want the base model Pixel 9 or the beastly Pixel 9 Pro XL, you've come to the right place: I built this guide so you know exactly where to look when the Black Friday sales go live.</p><p>There aren't too many deals available just yet, but I expect that to change dramatically in the coming weeks. If you're looking for more than just a new smartphone this holiday season, I also recommend taking a look at our guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare">best Black Friday Pixel deals</a>, where I share more discounts on smartwatches, tablets, and more. Now enough chatter, let's get on with the deals.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 deals</span></h3>
<p>The base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> starts at $799 for the 128GB version and $899 for the 256GB phone. Both configurations boast 12GB of RAM straight out of the box, plus you'll enjoy the efficiency of the new Tensor G4 chipset alongside an improved 4,700mAh battery and loads of AI-powered software features. </p>

<p>For the first time ever, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is the same size as the base model Google Pixel 9 — but fear not, things still look quite different under the hood. The Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts the Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, plus you get an improved 42 MP front camera system and a telephoto lens (another first for Google devices). The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there's also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.</p>

<ul><li>Google is pushing an update to Workspace customers that includes Gemini-backed summaries for unread conversations.</li><li>A "summarize" button will appear when hovering over conversations and interacting with it produces a bulleted list of "important" information.</li><li>Earlier in October, Google Chat picked up video messaging, an extension of its earlier voice messages update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for its Chat app that&apos;ll tell you everything you need to know <em>before </em>opening a thread.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-summaries-google-chat.html">Workspace post</a>, Google highlighted the beginning of its "Gemini in Chat" update that brings AI-backed summaries to busy conversations. The company states users will soon find a bulleted list of "important" points from an unread chat thread in the app. Google states the feature may help users "focus" and find what&apos;s important before tackling other tasks.</p><p>Users opening Chat&apos;s "Home" page on the web will find Gemini&apos;s typical starry "summarize" button when hovering over an unread conversation. Clicking it will expand the single line like a drop-down menu. From there, users will see a "Summary" banner with the key points Gemini feels are important. Google states this is intended to be a "synopsis" of the conversation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini&apos;s</a> chat summaries are rolling out for mobile users, too. However, to surface them, users on mobile must long-press an unread chat thread. Gemini&apos;s summaries will appear automatically above the app&apos;s typical list of thread options.</p><p>Of course, Google includes its typical AI tagline that it could "get things wrong." Users may want to hop in and check things out just to be safe. Additionally, the post states users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10079371">can turn this off</a> if they don&apos;t want Gemini going through for synopsis purposes.</p><p>The update is rolling out for web, Android, and iOS users today (Oct 21) on rapid and scheduled release domains. Google Workspace customers with the following add-ons are eligible: Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and AI & Messaging.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s been upgrading Chat throughout 2024, with its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-gets-video-messages-feature">hitting users earlier in October</a>. The update brought video messaging similar to what you&apos;d experience in WhatsApp. Google gives users a way to record three-minute-long videos in the Chat app. These video messages can be sent in direct messages (one-on-one), group DMs, and spaces.</p><p>What&apos;s more, this update is essentially an add-on to Google&apos;s earlier update from March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-mobile-rollout">added voice messages to Chat</a>. Users can tap the microphone icon to begin recording their voice instead of typing a text in a DM or group DM. Unfortunately, voice messages are restricted to Enterprise customers.</p>

<ul><li>The latest beta version of WhatsApp has a new Chat memory feature for Meta AI.</li><li>It allows the chatbot to save users' preferences and personal details in order to give users a more personalized response.</li><li>The feature is seen testing in beta and is likely to debut soon in future updates.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta AI integration is widely popular as Meta owns quite a few notable apps, such as Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, that integrate its chatbot. With WhatsApp, it looks like a new feature for Meta AI is in development, which has been spotted in the latest beta version of the app.</p><p>According to folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-22-9-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, the WhatsApp beta for Android (version <strong>2.24.22.9</strong>, appears to have a new feature under development that adds Chat memory for Meta AI. The new feature aims to make the chatbot's experience more personalized.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.72%;"><img id="pBBrT6TbCjP2hAAbM5SDAb" name="whatsapp-meta-ai-chatbot-new-feature.jpg" alt="Chat memory for Meta AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBBrT6TbCjP2hAAbM5SDAb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="772" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In what appears to be a future update, Meta AI will be able to automatically remember some details shared with the chatbot. Utilizing the chat memory, users can get more relevant and customized responses when chatting with Meta AI. </p><p>Users can access this setting by opening the Meta AI chat, tapping the profile at the top, and tapping the new "Memory" tab right under the Notifications and Media visibility sections. WABetaInfo further notes that Meta AI can retain many users' details, such as their diet preferences, birthdays, allergies, books, and what kind of podcasts they like.</p>
<p>The chatbot's responses after the update will be based on the details stored in the Meta AI. Despite storing all such data, users are believed to have full control over the data they choose to share with the chatbot. This data can also be deleted at any time, which users need to be aware of whenever they want to share their personal preferences. </p><p>Having a more personal chatbot based on your interests could make Meta AI more useful than getting more generic responses. The latest feature is currently in the works since it is in beta and can be downloaded through the Google Play Beta Program. General users will be able to see the update once the rollout begins, which should likely be sooner rather than later.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors state the Pixel 9a's dimensions could arrive as: 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm.</li><li>Speculation states the Pixel 9a's display could rise from the Pixel 8a's 6.1-inch display to 6.2 or 6.3 inches.</li><li>A host of alleged Pixel 9a renders surfaced recently, suggesting the phone could forgo an iconic aspect of the Pixel lineup.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak claims to have narrowed down the dimensions of the upcoming budget Pixel from Google.</p><p>The leaks stem from known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1847298428906127770">OnLeaks</a>, who states they&apos;ve received "updated data" about the Pixel 9a&apos;s dimensions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/10/google-pixel-9a-dimensions.html">Android Headlines</a>). According to the rumors, the next A-series Pixel could sport the following measurements: 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm. The tipster adds that the final measurement rises to "9.4mm" when the rear camera housing is accounted for.</p><p>These measurements suggest a slightly higher (taller) and wider device than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a&apos;s</a> 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9mm measurements.</p><p>Rumors about the device&apos;s display remain relatively uncertain. However, the publication theorizes that the slight changes in the Pixel 9a&apos;s dimensions could produce a small display increase. The publication speculates the Pixel 9a could greet users with a 6.2 to 6.3-inch display, which would put it up against the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 9</a>. </p><p>Moreover, as the publication adds, the A-series Pixel often boasts larger bezels than the flagship line. With that in mind, this slight dimension change may not matter much. The Pixel 9a could end up featuring <em>even more </em>noticeable bezels than we may want.</p><p>This is speculation at this point, so take this in with caution.</p>

<p>There&apos;s still some time before a Pixel 9a reveal, but that&apos;s not stopping a slew of renderings from surfacing. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">alleged imagery</a> suggests the Pixel 9a will mirror the flagship Pixel 9 series&apos; design but with one major change: a lack of a camera visor. Rumors claim the phone will drop the massive camera bump in favor of an array flush to the rear panel.</p><p>Google stood by its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">large and proud camera bump</a> on the Pixel 9 in August. However, the company cited consumer interest in photography as the catalyst for the bump. Google&apos;s Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger said that an interest in wanting sharper, clearer photos requires beefier sensors and lenses — thus the big bump.</p><p>How this rumored change affects the Pixel 9a&apos;s camera performance remains to be seen.</p><p>In other news, the Pixel 9a is rumored to grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">strange Tensor G4 change</a>.

We&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7a-tensor-g2-alleged-packaging">seen this happen</a> with the Pixel 7a, so it seems history is repeating itself.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is rumored to debut in Q2 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a 3nm TSMC-made SoC, at its annual summit on Monday.</li><li>It has two 4.32GHz prime cores and six 3.53GHz performance cores, along with 5.3Gbps LPDDR5X memory.</li><li>Qualcomm promises its new Oryon CPU offers a 45% single- and multi-core performance boost with a 44% efficiency boost over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li><li>Its GPU and NPU performance have also improved by 40% and 45%, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you find Qualcomm's naming scheme for its chips confusing, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is named to make things obvious: This is its fastest system-on-a-chip (SoC) yet, built to make flagship Android phones more powerful than ever.</p><p>Announced at the Qualcomm Summit 2024 in Maui, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is the first to use a custom Oryon CPU instead of the usual ARM Cortex cores. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, it won't have any low-clocked efficiency chips, either: its six performance cores hit 3.53GHz, which is faster than the 3.3GHz Cortex-X4 found in the last-gen SoC. And its two prime cores will hit a blazing 4.32GHz.</p><p>As you'd expect, this leads to a 45% boost in single- and multi-core performance over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it's 44% more efficient at hitting the same top benchmarks. We'll have to see how the Snapdragon 8 Elite does for low-power efficiency, but Qualcomm implied during a media session that its performance cores would have no trouble on that front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Qualcomm emphasizes the Snapdragon 8 Elite's AI boosts over the last generation as well: a 45% faster NPU and 45% better performance per watt. It'll enable popular LMMs like Llama and Gemini to integrate "directly" onto phones for speedy multi-modal AI generation.</p>

<p>Qualcomm promises that these AI enhancements will help specifically for better 5G connectivity. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">Snapdragon X80</a> pairs with the AI Suite Gen 3 that's meant to improve power handling, coverage, latency, QoS, mmWave beam management, and GNSS location, with a specific 30% location accuracy boost "even in parking structures."</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite jumps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/now-available-new-version-of-the-bluetooth-core-specification/">Bluetooth 6.0</a>, which was only announced this September and offers some key upgrades to security and "distance awareness." And it directly integrates Ultra Wideband for precision finding and digital key tech.</p><p>Qualcomm didn't specify which Adreno GPU will be in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but it did promise a 40% performance speed boost, 40% power savings, and 35% increased ray tracing performance. It has three GPU slices clocked at 1.1GHz and 12MB graphics memory.</p>

<p>As for other subtle changes, the Snapdragon 8 Elite supports QHD+ resolution up to 240Hz refresh rates, which could offer some incredibly smooth gaming experiences to go with the graphics boost. And we could begin to see 320MP camera sensors for the first time.</p><p>Even though everyone assumed the Snapdragon 8 Elite would be called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, Qualcomm decided to give it the same "Elite" moniker as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> that it built for PCs.</p><p>Aside from saying it "deserves a new name" because of its custom CPU, Qualcomm wouldn't clarify whether future "Elite" SoCs would keep the "Gen X" label or if non-Elite Snapdragon flagship chips with Arm cores would continue, saying it wouldn't talk about its future roadmap.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this month, MediaTek revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400 SoC</a> with one 3.62GHz Cortex core, three 3.3GHz performance cores, and four 2.4GHz efficiency cores, all built on the same TSMC N3E process.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">Dimensity 9300</a>, its performance gap—35% and 28% faster single- and multi-core performance with 40% better efficiency, plus 41% improved GPU power—isn't that far off from the gains Qualcomm got with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, even though the clock speeds have a significant gap.</p><p>MediaTek says the Dimensity 9400 hit 3,055/9,600 for a Geekbench 6.2 test or 2.8 million for AnTuTu. Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 8 Elite hits 3,222 / 10,444 on Geekbench 6.3 or 3 million for AnTuTu.</p><p>Qualcomm wins the benchmark battle, and it does so with its own Oryon cores instead of paying for Arm's. But you might be surprised that the gap isn't <em>wider</em>, given just how high the 8 Elite clock speed is. We'll have to get ahold of phones using both chips and see how they perform in the real world before we can judge for certain.</p>

How in the world could Meta possibly deliver a headset that's $200 cheaper without sacrificing the Quest 3's power, color mixed reality vision, new controllers with advanced haptic feedback, and all the improvements to the Quest ecosystem that have happened over the next year?</p><p>Somehow, they've done it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> is a triumph in nearly every way, from its highly polished onboarding presentation to the excellent mixed reality content that's been developed over the past year. It feels like a palpable upgrade from the Quest 2 and even sports some design and UX improvements over the more expensive Quest 3.</p><p>Obviously, there have to be <em>some</em> concessions to get to a $299 price point but there are surprisingly few. The biggest is the display stack, as it uses the same lenses and display from the Quest 2 but still features plenty of visual upgrades and tweaks. That includes a next-generation processor, improved rendering and processing, and much more. If you're looking for a next-gen VR headset upgrade from a Quest 2 at an affordable price, you've found it.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S retails for $299 and includes 128GB of storage, while the Meta Quest 3S with 256GB of storage retails for $399. Both models come in a white colorway and come with a pair of Quest 3 touch controllers, a preinstalled cloth head strap, and a preinstalled cloth facial interface.</p><p>Every Meta Quest 3S comes with a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow and 3 months of the Meta Quest Plus subscription service until April 2025.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3s-accessories-that-transfer-from-quest-2-and-3">Meta Quest 2 accessories work on a Quest 3S</a>, so you can keep some of those around instead of having to buy new ones. Likewise, most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories" target="_blank">best Quest 3 accessories</a> work on a Quest 3S, with the exception of the facial interface, which has a new design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="dvZWqvmaCxLUBUcrdbA7AN" name="Wearing a Meta Quest 3S" alt="Wearing a Meta Quest 3S with the default cloth strap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dvZWqvmaCxLUBUcrdbA7AN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta has learned a thing or two about headset comfort over the past few years, but that doesn't mean the Quest 3S is perfect. It's only a gram lighter than the Quest 3, which was a few grams heavier than the Quest 2. All of this, despite still shipping with a cloth strap that I find generally uncomfortable, although it's fine for short play sessions.</p><p>The biggest problem with the cloth strap is that it rests on the top of my ears and irritates my skin rather quickly. Meta is using the same Y-shaped top strap design it launched with the Quest 3, which means it better allocates weight across the head but still doesn't work anywhere near as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bobovr-m3-pro-review-meta-quest-3-headstrap">BoboVR M3 Pro</a> head strap does, for instance.</p><p>Beyond that, though, the Quest 3S is just as comfortable as the Quest 3 out of the box and maybe even more so thanks to the new facial interface design. The new, more padded, and supple face pad that was preinstalled on the headset feels wonderful. Historically, I couldn't wait to swap out the facial interface with a third-party one, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this one is.</p><p>The headset is also 20mm slimmer than the Quest 2, so it has a weight distribution closer to your face. Quest 3 is an additional 10mm slimmer than Quest 3S.</p>

<p>However there are still three main reasons to choose a good third-party facial interface replacement once reputable companies release them. First is hygiene. The cloth is nice and soft but also absorbs sweat. Grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Orzero-Compatible-Anti-Sweat-Waterproof-Accessories/dp/B0DJ6LX4V7/">$12 pair of silicone covers</a> for now, especially if you sweat a lot or share the headset with other people.</p><p>The second reason to replace the stock facial interface is because of lens fog. I haven't had issues with it during the review period because it's been cool and dry here, but as soon as the humidity ramps up again in half a year I'll need something more breathable. For now, Meta makes an excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Breathable-Facial-Interface-Increases/dp/B09MJS71W4/">breathable facial interface</a> with semi-transparent sides. I used this one at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S hands-on</a> event and loved it.</p><p>Third, if you use glasses, some third-party facial interfaces have built-in glasses spacing adjustments. The default Meta Quest 3 facial interface includes a way to adjust for glasses, but the one on the Quest 3S doesn't. You'll need to use the glasses spacer in the box to do this which doesn't offer as many spacing options as the Quest 3 method.</p>

<p>That said, the new interface design makes it <em>far</em> easier to swap out the facial interface than any other Quest headset to date. This has been improved with every generation, so it's good to see it continue to happen.</p><p>But even if you don't swap out any of these modular parts right away, I think short play sessions will be comfortable enough. Thankfully, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> work on the Quest 3S, except for the replacement of the facial interface. You'll need one specifically made for the Quest 3S.</p><p>Keep in mind that the Quest 3S does not have a 3.5mm audio jack, so if you want to use headphones instead of the excellent built-in speakers on the Quest 3S arms, I recommend picking up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW/" target="_blank">PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds</a>. Regular Bluetooth earbuds or headphones won't work in VR because Bluetooth's latency is too high. This can actually make you feel sick because of an odd disconnect between what your brain hears and what it sees.</p>

<p>In my testing, I've found that the Quest 3S has the best battery life of any modern Quest headset. On average, I got around two and a half hours of use from a single charge, with more power-hungry games like Batman Arkham Shadow bringing that down to around 2 hours.</p><p>I'd say if you were planning to just use the Quest 3S with the default head strap and facial interface, this is more than enough time before any kind of fatigue sets in. Grabbing a new head strap with built-in battery like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-M3-Pro-Accessories-Compatible/dp/B0CJLG9SBR/">BoboVR M3 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Boost-Battery-Compatible/dp/B0D6W88TCN/">Kiwi Design H4</a> will add several hours of battery life and significantly better comfort overall, making it a worthwhile $50 upgrade.</p>

<p>If you directly compare the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, this section holds the only real differences you'll notice. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same display and Fresnel lenses as the Meta Quest 2, so if you've only ever used a Quest 1 or Quest 2, you probably won't be particularly disappointed in the Quest 3S's display or lenses.</p><p>All in all, they're fine and suit a $299 headset rather well. As with all Fresnel lenses, there's a small "sweet spot" right in the middle of each lens where you'll get the clearest view. Anything outside of this circle gets blurrier the closer you look to the edges.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Quest 3S uses the same lenses and display as the Quest 2, foregoing most next-generation upgrades from the more expensive Quest 3.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The 90-degree FoV on the Quest 3S's lenses feels a bit constricting compared to the substantially wider 110-degree FoV of the Quest 3. This difference cannot be understated, and it all melds together to show just how superior the lenses on the Quest 3 are.</p>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S's lenses also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-adjust-eye-distance-ipd-oculus-quest-2">adjust the same way as the Quest 2</a>, so if you're coming from a Quest 2 you'll know exactly what to do. The only difference is that there's no 1/2/3 preset number in the middle of the lenses that changes as you adjust the spacing. Meta says it cut this mechanism to keep the manufacturing cost of the headset as low as possible, allowing it to hit that $299 price point.</p><p>That being said, if you have an interpupillary distance (IPD) over 72mm you're probably going to find the Meta Quest 3S uncomfortable. If you find yourself in this boat, a 3D printed IPD expander <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4627924">like this one</a> will push the lenses out a bit and help.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>If you plan to work in VR or use it for a lot of text-based applications, it makes more sense to spend the extra money on a Quest 3.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Like the lenses, the display on the Meta Quest 3S is the same as the one on the Quest 2. It gets plenty bright, but the contrast is fairly low, the colors are a bit on the dull side, and the resolution is noticeably lower than the Quest 3's panels.</p><p>As far as clarity is concerned, I'd say the resolution difference between Quest 3 and Quest 3S is similar to playing games at 1440p vs 1080p. The Quest 3S isn't as sharp, and fine detail gets a bit lost, but it's not offensively lower resolution.</p><p>If there's any one area where the resolution and lenses make a big difference, it's for folks who want to work in VR. If that's going to be a big part of your headset usage, stick with the Quest 3.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NhxMWMZ7ttTYBw5L27srRT" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-controllers-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NhxMWMZ7ttTYBw5L27srRT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 use identical controllers. These new controllers ditch the LED ring and tighten up some ergonomics for a much smaller profile than the Quest 2's controllers. Tracking is still done with LEDs, though, which are situated around the controller face and handles.</p><p>Tracking is enhanced through better camera positioning around the headset—particularly the lower side-mounted cameras, which can see better along the sides and below the headset than on the Quest 2—and Meta's Horizon OS, which fills in any visual tracking gaps with gyro sensor data from inside the controller and an AI algorithm that predicts hand position based on arm and shoulder movements.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Quest 3S uses the same advanced controllers as the Quest 3 and are powered by a single AA battery.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each controller is powered by a single AA battery. Based on my extended usage of the Quest 3 over the past year, you'll only need to swap them out once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-long-quest-3-controller-battery-lasts">every two months </a>or so, depending on how often you play. I recommend picking up these cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Rechargeable-Batteries-8-Pack-Pre-charged/dp/B00CWNMV4G/">Amazon Basics rechargeable AA batteries</a> for a few bucks so you can keep reusing them.</p><p>Each controller has a battery door that can be swapped out for any number of excellent controller accessories, like these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/amvr-quest-3-controller-grips-review">AMVR controller grips</a>, which add grip and help balance the controllers better with a handy hand strap.</p><p>Quest 3S also supports what's called Inside-Out Body Tracking, which only a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-body-tracking" target="_blank">handful of games currently support</a>. However, developers may start to use it more now that another Quest headset supports the feature. With this, in-game character movements will feel more realistic as the headset can properly align the virtual character's torso, shoulders, and arms with your actual movements in real life.</p>

<p>Meta Quest 3S has also been outfitted with two IR illuminators on the front, positioned on the outside of each triple camera array on the front. This is a new feature for any Quest headset and allows the Quest 3S to see completely in the dark, provided you're in a small enough room.</p><p>I tested different rooms at night with the lights off, and while tracking didn't work at all in my living room, it worked perfectly in any bedroom I tried it in. Essentially, as long as the Quest 3S can see walls, it will be able to track spatial movement in the dark.</p>

<p>Likewise, hand tracking is better than ever—particularly in low light—than with any Quest headset to date. While I found daytime tracking performance and accuracy to be essentially identical to the more expensive Quest 3, Quest 3S can also track hands in the dark.</p><p>That should help significantly in some dimly lit rooms when playing hand-tracked games or during casual entertainment when you're just using your hands to navigate the UI.</p>

<p>While you'll notice the controller differences and slimmer profile of the headset when unboxing it, nothing prepares you for the color mixed reality vision until you've tried it. It's not as clear as an Apple Vision Pro or even the Meta Quest 3 because of the lenses, but it's beyond just a generational upgrade from the Quest 2. If anything, it's like going from a 1950s black-and-white TV to a color HDTV.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S uses the same 4MP dual front-facing cameras as the Quest 3 and tends to look even brighter thanks to the lenses. Yes, Fresnel lenses aren't as crisp as the pancake lenses on Quest 3, but they allow more light in from the display giving it a distinctly brighter look.</p><p>Because the lenses aren't as sharp and the display's resolution is lower, it's a bit harder to read text on a phone while wearing the headset, but this isn't a common mixed reality use case, anyway.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S doesn't include a depth sensor like the Quest 3 has, but that doesn't seem to affect its mixed reality performance in my testing. As you can see in the video above, the Quest 3S is a little slower at mapping than the Quest 3 but not inordinately so.</p><p>It took the Quest 3S roughly nine seconds longer to map my living room, but some of that time was because I ran into an early bug where hand tracking in some UI elements felt laggy. Realistically, it probably only took the Quest 3S around seven seconds longer to do the actual mapping, which is impressive given that it just uses cameras to do the work.</p>

<p>Meta's Horizon OS has been notably upgraded in its mixed reality capabilities since the launch of the Quest 3 last year, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-v64-room-scanning-update">automatic room mapping</a> and object identification that makes mixed reality effortless.</p><p>Additionally, a new mixed reality button on the bottom of the Quest 3S makes it effortless to jump between virtual reality and mixed reality. It's a <strong>substantial upgrade</strong> from all prior Meta Quest headsets which required you to perform an awkward and extremely unreliable double-tap on the side of the headset.</p>

<p>Because the VR gaming industry is relatively small compared to traditional consoles, the Meta Quest 3S's closest competition is made up of Meta headsets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-2" target="_blank">Quest 3S replaces the Quest 2</a> as the new standard in affordable VR. Its processor is 100% more powerful than the Quest 2, enabling it to play far richer and more detailed games and render impressive color mixed reality in your room.</p><p>It's an easy recommendation to upgrade from a Quest 2 because of the price, but the full next-generation upgrade can be found in the Meta Quest 3. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Compared to the Quest 3S</a>, the Meta Quest 3 sports next-generation lenses with a 20-degree wider field of view (FoV), significantly enhanced clarity, a higher resolution display, and better contrast and colors than the Quest 3S. Surprisingly, Quest 3 doesn't include IR illuminators, so it can't play in the dark like Quest 3S.</p><p>If you're a PCVR-only player, it would also make more sense to get a Quest 3 because of the enhanced clarity brought about by the lenses and display. Otherwise, if you prefer a headset with an OLED display or a much smaller headset, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bigscreenvr.com/">Bigscreen Beyond</a> is your best bet.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best of virtual reality and mixed reality but don't want to spend $500 on a Quest 3.</li><li>You want to play Quest 3-exclusive games and apps.</li><li>You're new to VR and don't want to invest a lot in case you don't like it.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You plan to work in VR. The lenses and display make it difficult to read fine text in this setting.</li><li>You don't like Fresnel lenses.</li></ul>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. If I had to compare the experience to more traditional gaming specs, I'd say it's similar to the difference between a 1080p and 4K setup.</p><p>Otherwise, the Meta Quest 3S is everything you need in a VR and mixed-reality headset today. It not only offers the highest-quality standalone VR games available—including the incredible <em>free</em> pack-in Batman Arkham Shadow—but it also connects to any PC and can play PCVR games completely wirelessly. It's a win-win-win for anyone looking to get into VR or upgrade from an older headset.</p><p>There are certainly reasons to choose a Quest 3 over a Quest 3S, but for most people, the price point and overall value of the Quest 3S make it a must-buy console this Holiday season.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest major Android OS update is reportedly more of a hindrance than a help for a few past-gen devices.</p><p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g8cucs/pixel_6_bricked_after_enabling_private_space/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">took to Reddit</a> over the weekend to voice several issues after updating to Android 15 on a Pixel 6 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-15-killing-pixel-6-devices/">Android Police</a>). The OP (original poster) of the thread, GegoByte, posted a PSA to users stating, "don&apos;t enable the private space feature if you upgrade to Android 15. I unlocked the private space area, opened an app I installed in it, and it bricked my Pixel 6."</p><p>The user added that they&apos;ve been unable to turn their device on or reboot it using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6377386?hl=en#:~:text=If%20your%20phone%20is%20frozen,about%2030%20seconds%20to%20restart.">the typical methods</a> explained by Google. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g8cucs/comment/lsy1fr4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Another user</a> offered the option of heading into the phone&apos;s boot menu; however, the original reporter claims they cannot reach it.</p><p>Curiously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g86k1t/pixel_6_pro_dead_after_android_15_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">another report</a> states their Pixel 6 Pro died after updating to Android 15 despite having a 45% charge remaining. Plugging the device into its charging cable didn&apos;t produce a response and Google&apos;s listed troubleshooting methods proved fruitless. More importantly, the user states this occurred <em>after </em>enabling Private Spaces.</p><p>Though these issues are terrible, they don&apos;t seem widespread. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g8cucs/comment/lsydzq1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states</a> they&apos;ve updated to Android 15 <em>and </em>enabled Private Spaces on their Pixel 6 with no problem. Regardless, the most sound piece of advice is to contact Google Support if your Pixel 6/6 Pro is encountering problems.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the issues concerning Android 15/Private Spaces. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>The Pixel 6 is seemingly having a rough 2024. Earlier this year, the series encountered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-factory-reset-might-zap-your-phone">an issue with factory resets</a>. The total wipe reportedly bricked Pixel 6 phones in July. After resetting, users experienced a "Cannot load Android system" error message. The error makes one believe there&apos;s corrupt data or something else wrong with the device, which pushes the phone into another (failed) reset.</p><p>The issue was fixed during the August 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-august-2024-update">security patch</a>. Of course, if the current issue is tied to Private Spaces exclusively on the Pixel 6, then the only path is to leave it disabled. Still, hopefully, Google can cook up a fix quicker this time for those affected.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-now-makes-pixel-phones-a-fortress-against-thieves-and-fraudsters">Android 15</a> started hitting Pixel devices last week. The major OS update isn&apos;t flashy, but it delivers several crucial security features to protect a user&apos;s data against theft. Pixel owners are picking up three features under the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Protection</a>" banner, like "Theft Detection Lock," "Offline Lock," and "Remote Lock."</p><p>Additionally, Google&apos;s phones grabbed a huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October feature drop</a>. The update is full of features like "Audio Magic Eraser," a Gemini Extension for Pixel Screenshots, and more. Moreover, a few of Google&apos;s past-gen "Legacy" phones grab several next-gen features to keep them feeling fresh. Private Spaces is with Android 15 and enters as a way for users to hide sensitive apps with important personal data.</p>

It has been four years since Google announced a "flagship" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming device</a>, the Chromecast with Google TV (4K). Now, Google is trying to work its way back into the fight with the all-new Google TV Streamer.</p><p>Instead of the plug-and-play solution that the Chromecast and Fire TV Stick offer, Google opted for a completely different approach. Part of this is due to Google attempting to improve its image while also trying to provide a more premium experience for its customers.</p>

<p>The Google TV Streamer was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">announced</a> and made available for pre-order on August 6 alongside the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). It was subsequently released on September 24, coming in either Hazel or Porcelain, and retails for $99.99. You can currently purchase the TV Streamer from a variety of retailers, including Best Buy, Target, and others, or directly from Google.</p>

<p>No matter how you look at it, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/why-the-google-tv-streamer-is-more-important-than-you-think">Google TV Streamer</a> is a sleek and well-designed device. It sports the same soft-touch finish found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast</a>, which extends to the color-matched (and new) Voice Remote.</p><p>Since this isn't just a dongle that hangs out of sight, it was important to provide a sleek design that won't stick out like a sore thumb. I think that Google nailed it here, as the TV Streamer has looked pretty darn great in both my home office and on the TV stand in my living room.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yYFevuVxe3frHHjPf5XvAU" name="google-tv-streamer-rear-ports.jpg" alt="Rear ports on the Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yYFevuVxe3frHHjPf5XvAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm also a big fan of the trio of ports found on the back. We have a Gigabit Ethernet jack, along with HDMI 2.1, and the USB-C port provides both data and power, which is rather important. There's also a small button that can be used to find your remote, another benefit of the TV Streamer. I've only had to use this once so far, but it was nice not needing to lift up my couch in a frantic search after my son decided to put it in his bin of toys.</p><p>In general, I don't really have much to say about the actual Google TV experience from a streaming standpoint. Almost all of my streaming apps are available, and with the upgraded 32GB of storage, I can sideload apps without much worry.</p>

<p>So far, my favorite feature of the TV Streamer has been the various smart home implementations that have been made. The Home Panel has been a dream, letting me turn off lights in a room, lock the front door, or adjust the thermostat without needing to get up.</p><p>As such, I was excited to swap out my Ring Doorbell for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review">Nest Doorbell</a>, only to find out that <em>something</em> happened to the Nest, making it unusable. Even still, I can also keep an eye on my dog while she's lounging on the porch courtesy of the Nest Cam mounted on the back corner of my house.</p><p>All of that is great, especially for my wife, but the TV Streamer brings two things in particular that are more exciting to me — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter#section-what-is-thread">Thread</a> support. More specifically, the TV Streamer doubles as a Thread border router, so I don't need to worry about getting OEM-specific accessories when I want to upgrade my smart home gear.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Technically, you can add the TV Streamer to Apple HomeKit, but I don't recommend it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A surprising discovery was that I could even add the TV Streamer to the Apple Home app. But it doesn't show up or operate as a streaming device, instead appearing as a series of switches. So while we're one step closer to the dream, it's obvious that we aren't there just yet.</p><p>Now onto a rather niche use case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YFbWonPbQGcRNDiUx9v6jf" name="google-tv-streamer-with-usb-c-hub-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with DockCase USB-C Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFbWonPbQGcRNDiUx9v6jf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something I rather enjoy doing with my streaming devices is attempting to turn them into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything">retro gaming boxes</a>. The easy part is getting RetroArch installed and set up, but storage has almost always been the Achilles heel. The 32GB of storage on the Google TV Streamer is plenty for the majority of people, but I wanted more.</p><p>They say that the third time's the charm, as that's how many different USB-C hubs I had to try before finding one that would recognize my thumb drive. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/dockcase-smart-usb-c-hub-10-in-1-explorer-edition-review">Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub</a> is definitely overkill for the situation, but since it was the first one that worked, it's the one I've stuck with. Although I'll probably try and find a different one so that I can put this back in my backpack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hswgtRku3tkVgCQCyc8yYZ" name="google-tv-streamer-review-retroarch-1.jpg" alt="RetroArch on the Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hswgtRku3tkVgCQCyc8yYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After plugging the USB-A thumb drive into the Dockcase USB-C Hub and plugging that into the TV Streamer, everything worked just as you'd expect. The 64GB of extra storage was immediately recognized, so I fired up RetroArch and started messing around.</p><p>For the most part, this offers decent performance, but there have been a few hiccups that I'll cover a bit later. Nevertheless, I can't get over how much fun it is being able to fire up RetroArch with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-to-unlock-stadia-controller-bluetooth">Stadia controller</a> and play those classic retro games.</p>

<p>Here's something I don't understand — why is Google, or any company for that matter, using a processor that's more than three years old? That's exactly what we have in the TV Streamer, as it's powered by MediaTek's MT8696. This just so happens to be the same SoC found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review-obnoxious-ads-ruin-fun">Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K Max from 2021</a>. The same one that was replaced by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">faster model</a> about a year ago.</p><p>To be clear, the only hiccups in performance that I've seen have been with trying to mess around with RetroArch and different emulators. However, there's no way this is going to be able to still be this snappy a few years down the road. I really would've liked to see Google stop this "glass half-full" approach that we've seen in various devices over the years.</p><p>Part of the reason I don't really have much to say about the interface is that it's not all that great. Sure, it gives me some pretty solid recommendations while putting my installed apps near the top. But that's about where it starts to fall short for me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DvQ6VUVGATmkT7wGxYesUL" name="google-tv-streamer-review-google-freeplay-1.jpg" alt="Google Freeplay on the Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvQ6VUVGATmkT7wGxYesUL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite having the app set up and installed, the only options shown within the "Live" tab are for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-is-cranking-up-the-content-with-a-fresh-batch-of-free-channels">Google's Freeplay service</a>. That's great and all, but why can't I access the channels from the streaming service I want?</p><p>It's not like Google isn't aware of the other streaming services out there, so let me connect and use the pay that I pay for. Maybe the onus is on the streaming service, and not Google, but I have a feeling that's not the case considering there's no settings panel that lets you connect to other live TV services.</p><p>Another potential issue feels more like an oversight. You just picked up the TV Streamer, and you're excited to get it all set up and everything. You tear the box apart, go to plug everything in, and realize that you're missing something—the HDMI cable.</p><p>That's because Google doesn't include one in the box but <em>will</em> sell you an "Ultra High-Speed" cable for another $20. Of course, this doesn't help much now that you already have the TV Streamer without a cable to connect it to your TV.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7" name="google-tv-streamer-apps-page.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Apps page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is attempting to semi-rectify the situation by offering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/googles-dollar10-hdmi-cable-credit-for-the-tv-streamer-should-last-forever">$10 discount code</a> if you pre-ordered the TV Streamer. However, this only applies to pre-ordered units, and the "deal" will expire at the end of November. There's a good chance that you have an HDMI cable lying around, but the point is that it's something Google should have included in the box.</p><p>My last gripe has to do with game streaming apps, and how few of them are actually available. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-play-xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-on-chromebooks">Xbox Game Pass</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/ps-remote-play-ps5-streaming-chromecast-with-google-tv">PS Remote Play</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-luna-hands-on">Amazon Luna</a> are nowhere to be found. When trying to download them from the Play Store website on my PC, the Streamer is greyed out and says "This item is not compatible with your device."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7XK9PypwQTGubUVVUuNTgn" name="google-tv-streamer-review-xbplay.jpg" alt="XBPlay listing on Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XK9PypwQTGubUVVUuNTgn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have no earthly idea what's happening here, but this isn't it. Sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a> and Steam Link show up, which is great. But we should also be able to use the others, and I wish we knew why this isn't the case.</p><p>Maybe Google is playing "keep away" after Game Pass landed on the Fire TV earlier this year. Whatever the reason, it's time for these tactics to stop because, at the end of the day, you're only hurting the people who end up buying your products.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EVNMUf7pubBDDRNpVPAut" name="roku-ultra-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Roku Ultra 2024 lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EVNMUf7pubBDDRNpVPAut.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roku)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Apple TV 4K (3rd Gen) includes double the storage (64GB vs. 32GB), a more powerful processor (A15 Bionic), and an excellent streaming experience for about $30 more than the TV Streamer. However, the base model lacks an Ethernet port, nor does it double as a Thread border router. If those features matter to you, then you'll be looking at $149 for the Wi-Fi + Ethernet Apple TV.</p><p>More recently, Roku released its most powerful streaming device yet, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-ultra-2024-streamer-launch-os-14-detailed">Roku Ultra 2024</a>. The company claims it's "more than 30% faster than other Roku players," along with upgrading to Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1. There's smart home connectivity too, however, it appears that the integration is only available if you make use of Roku's growing lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a>.</p><p>Rounding out the pack is Amazon. Currently, you won't find a Fire TV device at the same price as the TV Streamer, as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max retails for $60, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2022-review">Cube</a> comes in at $140. It's a surprising "hole" in Amazon's lineup, so we wonder if Amazon might end up introducing something to go toe-to-toe with the TV Streamer in the future.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oCnTTS3eWJdJdcgbjv6mr9" name="google-tv-streamer-pixel-9-pro-pixel-watch-3-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Pixel Watch 3, Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCnTTS3eWJdJdcgbjv6mr9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a high-end Google TV streaming box.</li><li>You're tired of the onslaught of ads presented by competing devices.</li><li>You want a streaming device that doubles as a smart home hub, and more.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the most powerful streaming device.</li><li>You want to use this as a game streaming box.</li><li>You need a cheap streaming device.</li><li>You want integration between third-party live TV streaming services and the Streamer.</li></ul>
<p>When it comes to whether I would recommend the TV Streamer, I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place. For me, it's a no-brainer, as the ads aren't as annoying, I'm comfortable with side-loading apps, and the Streamer features Matter and Thread support. These are some of the things that I care about, in addition to offering seamless integration into my Google-focused smart home.</p><p>On the other hand, it's not as powerful as I feel it should be at this price. It doesn't help that the Streamer uses a less performant SoC than the latest Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which costs $40 less. Do I think Google missed the mark with pricing? Not in the slightest, but I do think corners were cut for the sake of margins, and it's just disappointing.</p><p>That being said, I've really enjoyed using the TV Streamer, and I'm already planning on picking up another one so I can stop moving this one back and forth between my home office and living room. I only hope that with a bit more RAM and storage wiggle room, Google can continue to improve the experience.</p>

<ul><li>With the October feature drop, Google introduced underwater photography to the Pixel 9 series.</li><li>The feature-included update is now seeing a wider rollout through the Pixel Camera 9.6 app version via Play Store.</li><li>It also brings a vertical panorama capture feature and Pixel devices ranging from Pixel 6 to Pixel 8a have easier access to astronomy.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently announced an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October feature drop</a> next to the Android 15 update for compatible Pixel phones, including the latest Pixel 9 series. The latter gains some exciting camera features, such as underwater photo and video capabilities.</p><p>The Pixel Camera 9.6 update provides these new capabilities, which, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/18/pixel-camera-9-6/">9to5Google</a>, is believed to be rolling out to all supported Pixel phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-2.jpg" alt="Camera app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is widely happening through the Play Store for devices above <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>. However, not all the models are suitable for the new camera features. For example, the underwater photography features are aimed at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series only, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> isn&apos;t part of it.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the underwater photography and video features enable users to restore true colors when the photo or video is captured underwater. Google also recommends using a waterproof case when using the device for longer periods. Enabling the toggle should help users shoot better underwater, and it applies to devices including Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>Suppose you own the latest Pixel 9 series device. In that case, you might be on the Pixel Camera 9.5 update, and installing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October feature drop</a> next to the Pixel Camera 9.6 update should not only give you the underwater photography feature next to a vertical panorama capture, which is said to be supported "in the redesigned mode." Earlier, users could only shoot horizontal panorama images.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-03.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5057" height="2848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera update will benefit non-Pixel 9 series users by adding some nifty features, too, like the ability to quickly enter into Astrophotography mode from the camera&apos;s Night Sight tab, reducing a couple of steps in navigation.</p><p>9to5 further notes that the Pixel Camera 9.6 adds strings to "Quick access controls," like the ability to adjust white balance, brightness, and shadows just by tapping the viewfinder. However, it still needs to be enabled for users to use it effectively.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra color options are tipped; however, no pink color option is in the works.</li><li>The color options of the next Ultra include Black, Green, Blue, and Titanium.</li><li>Another recent leak also revealed the device's new flatter design.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has already been in the news for its next flagship phones, especially since renders of the Galaxy S25 series, including the Ultra model, surfaced online very recently. A new tip from a notable leaker now gives us even more details about the Galaxy S25 Ultra model.</p><p>Tipster Ice Universe has shared the possible color options for the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra, which might be available in Black, Green, Blue, and Titanium colorways. The predecessor, which turned out to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, also featured similar color variants, and it appears the successor isn&apos;t offering any variety like the recent Pixel 9 series, which came in Pink shades for models in the lot.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING！The Galaxy S25 Ultra will debut in four color options:Black, Green, Blue, TitaniumI I don't know the online color scheme yet. pic.twitter.com/KNHZTC6lma<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1847464483763212618">October 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from the latest color options, the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra has been spotted multiple times over the past few weeks. It includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">first possible renders</a>, which give away everything about the Ultra&apos;s design. While it carries similar design elements to the previous iteration, the sides are likely to be flatter per the renders, and the camera visor is similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>This time, the device is also expected to be lighter, alongside the minor design changes. Earlier leaks have also revealed the camera system, which could include a 200MP H2 primary lens coupled with a 50MP ISOCELL JN3 ultra-wide-angle sensor. Users can also expect a 10MP IMX745 lens acting as a telephoto camera and another 50MP IMX584 5x lens.</p>
<p>Aside from these specs, the Galaxy S25 Ultra has also been spotted in some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4-hits-benchmark">Geekbench tests</a>, which not only confirmed the powerful single- and multi-core scores but also confirmed the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset (set to launch later this month) and the incorporation of 12GB RAM.</p><p>While we await its launch, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is still a couple of months away. Samsung is having yet another interesting launch event in Korea on October 21, where the long-rumored special edition of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is expected to launch. It will likely be slimmer than the latter, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1847799787950858418">Ice Universe also notes</a> that the 200MP sensor on the upcoming foldable will give better results than that featured in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>
