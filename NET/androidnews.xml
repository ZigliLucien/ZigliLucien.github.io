Verizon is currently selling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/products/buy-meta-quest-3-plus-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wayfarer-green-lenses-and-save-200/"><strong>Meta Quest 3 and the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Smart Glasses in a bundle for $200 LESS</strong></a> than the price you&apos;d normally pay for both. Since the Meta Quest 3 normally goes for $499.99, and the Ray-Ban Meta glasses for $299, savings from the Verizon deal will essentially pay two-thirds of the price of the smart glasses for you.</p>

<p>If you were considering getting both smart glasses and a VR headset, now's your chance! Verizon is selling the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> in a bundle for $200 cheaper than what they would cost separately. Gamers will especially appreciate the huge stockpile of Quest games available for the platform, and it's a major upgrade from the last-gen Quest 2. The Ray-Ban smart glasses are easy to use, and this particular bundle comes with the Wayfarer green lenses.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/products/buy-meta-quest-3-plus-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wayfarer-green-lenses-and-save-200/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="43fb3cff-d90f-4492-8e26-801ebe048326" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: $798.99" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: $798.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a> available, offering a wide variety of both virtual reality and mixed reality applications. It&apos;s especially great for gamers, boasting super high-powered graphics for some of the most immersive VR gaming the modern industry has to offer.</p><p>As for Ray-Ban&apos;s latest generation of smart glasses, they offer a powerful set of speakers and microphones, a high-quality camera, and easy-to-use Meta AI features. For the most part, they look like regular glasses, apart from the built-in LEDs at in the corners of the frames.</p><p>What else can be said? If you were already planning to up your mixed-reality game with both of these innovative products, it&apos;s hard to argue with this price. Then again, it may not be worthwhile for you if you don&apos;t think you&apos;ll use the smart glasses, or vice versa. </p>

<ul><li>Google announced plans to make Magic Editor available on phones other than those in the Pixel 8 series last month. </li><li>For iOS and Android users, only 10 free Magic Editor saves are available monthly without a subscription.</li><li>However, Pixel users can access Magic Editor completely free, and it appears to be rolling out on older Pixels now. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google previously announced that it would bring Magic Editor, the flagship generative AI photo editing feature that debuted alongside the Pixel 8 series, to other devices. Now, it appears that users of older Pixel devices are starting to see Magic Editor in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos app</a>, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/21/magic-editor-google-pixel/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted. Although the Magic Editor feature is eventually coming to all Google Photos users on devices that meet the minimum requirements, Pixel users get exclusive benefits.</p><p>Most importantly, all Pixel devices can use Magic Editor for free. iOS and Android (non-Pixel) users will be limited to 10 free Magic Editor saves per month when the feature rolls out. To gain more savings, these users will need to subscribe to the 2TB Google One Premium plan, which costs $10 per month. However, Pixel users get unlimited Magic Editor saves included with their device.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-editing-features-availability/" target="_blank">said</a> last month that Magic Editor would begin appearing in the Google Photos app on more devices starting May 15. Users started reporting seeing the feature on older Pixel phones this week. Of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> have had the Magic Editor feature since they were released.</p><p>Older devices need to meet specific hardware and software requirements to use Magic Editor. These include running Android 8.0 or newer and having a 64-bit chipset with at least 4 GB RAM. As long as those conditions are met, you’ll be able to use Magic Editor on your device soon. It may already be on your older Pixel. </p><p>Here are a few screenshots showing what Magic Editor looks like in action: </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.21%;"><img id="atqqnHCoYBzEavfV8yTQLL" name="magic-editor-how-to-use-3.jpg" alt="How to use Magic Editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atqqnHCoYBzEavfV8yTQLL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3024" height="2244" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above screenshot, Magic Editor on the Pixel 8 completely removes the skeleton of a dinosaur using generative AI. We have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">complete guide to using Magic Editor</a>, and while it was previously applied to the Pixel 8 series, it will work with older Pixels that gained Magic Editor support. </p><p>Aside from using generative AI to identify, remove, and replace certain parts of an image, there are a few other things Magic Editor can do. The feature can move something from one part of an image to another, filling the gap with generative fill. It can also apply contextual presets, such as “sky,” ”golden hour,” and ”stylized.”</p><p>Pixels are usually the first to gain new features, so Magic Editor will likely appear in the Google Photos app for non-Pixel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iPhones soon.</p>

It weighs less than 4 grams and is 2.6mm in thickness. It is also equipped with a 10 ATM water resistance rating.</p>

<p>The smart ring, which competes with the Oura Ring and the upcoming Galaxy Ring, equips health features like heart rate, SpO2, monitoring, and stress tracking. It further includes in-depth sleep monitoring, mental and physical readiness analysis, and sports data tracking.</p><p>The Size 10 Helio Ring has an 18.5mAh battery, and the Size 12 model has a 20.5mAh one. Both take around one hour and forty minutes to fully charge and are promised up to four days of battery life. </p><p>Additionally, it supports wireless charging. The Oura Ring gives users up to seven days of battery. However, use conditions like settings and health monitoring features may vary the promised battery life in both cases. </p><p>Lastly, Amazfit Helio Ring users should pair the smart ring with devices running Android 7.0 and above and iOS 14.0 and above for iPhones.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced a new side panel for select Google Workspace apps at Google I/O 2024, and it’s starting to roll out now.</li><li>The side panel uses Gemini 1.5 Pro and will first become available in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive. </li><li>Users that partake in the Google Workspace Labs and Gemini for Workspace Alpha programs will start seeing the refreshed side panel now, with wider availability set to come later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced that a new Gemini side panel would be coming to Workspace at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>, and it&apos;s starting to become widely available for early access testers. The upgraded side panel now uses the company&apos;s newest AI model, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and received a visual overhaul. It looks like the Gemini web client and bolsters the existing Gemini in Workspace feature set. </p><p>There have been AI-based features in Google Workspace since last I/O, like Help me write. However, the addition of this new Gemini 1.5 Pro sidebar unifies the experience of using AI in Workspace apps. It&apos;s derived from the Duet AI side panel that debuted earlier this year, and is slowly being rebranded as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, which is now the name for all of Google&apos;s AI efforts — from LLMs, to chatbots, to individual features.</p><p>Google said that testers would start seeing the Gemini 1.5 Pro side panel last week, but it&apos;s now widely available, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/22/google-gemini-side-panel-gmail-drive/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted. It&apos;s coming to Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive first, but it may appear in other Google Workspace apps in the future. While the general functionality is similar to other Gemini products, the difference-maker here is how the side panel ties into Workspace. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="egzqfVurwKqE8DSFGbcs3M" name="Gemini-1.5Pro-Side-Panel-Docs.jpg" alt="Google’s new Gemini side panel in Google Docs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egzqfVurwKqE8DSFGbcs3M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The expanded context window brought by Gemini 1.5 Pro allows it to use more data and different types of data to give quality answers. For example, in addition to summarizing the document you&apos;re currently reading in Google Docs, Gemini&apos;s side panel can also summarize a Google Meet call or draft an email. This happens using the context of the data provided so it is more accurate and tailored to the specific situation. </p><p>For now, only Google Workspace Labs and Gemini for Workspace Alpha users will see the Gemini 1.5 Pro side panel. You can sign up for Workspace Labs by clicking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/labs-sign-up/" target="_blank">this link</a>, but the side panel will only appear for enrolled accounts. </p><p>Eventually, the side panel will make its way to more users, but it&apos;ll be locked behind a paywall. Users will need to subscribe to either the Google One AI Premium plan or an enterprise Gemini for Workspace plan to access the sidebar. For those customers, the Gemini 1.5 side panel will appear next month. It could be expanded to free users in the future, though that isn&apos;t confirmed. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>POCO&apos;s F series has always been about delivering the best hardware in the mid-range segment, and while last year&apos;s F5 had a lot to offer in this area, the brand is taking things to a whole new level with the introduction of the F6 and F6 Pro. The F6 marks the debut of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 in most global markets, delivering flagship-tier performance.</p><p>That&apos;s just the start; the device also gets a new 120Hz AMOLED panel with increased resolution that now goes up to 2400 nits in HDR content, IP64 ingress protection, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4, and a new camera at the back that&apos;s significantly better than what I&apos;ve seen on a POCO phone thus far.</p><p>Xiaomi tends to rebrand existing devices and launch them under the POCO label, and that&apos;s no different with the F6 — the phone is identical to the Redmi Turbo 3 that debuted in April, but seeing as how that device isn&apos;t launching globally, there isn&apos;t going to be any overlap between the two.</p><p>What makes the F6 even better is the value; it manages to deliver better hardware than most of the options in this category, and does so for a lot less. That alone makes the phone worthy of a recommendation.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-pricing-and-availability"><span>POCO F6: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RwPBxRU64LcLELFMVVFpmZ" name="poco-f6-review-6.jpg" alt="Back of POCO F6 with texture highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwPBxRU64LcLELFMVVFpmZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO unveiled the F6 and F6 Pro at a launch event in Dubai on May 23, and the devices are set to go on sale globally in the coming weeks. Both the F6 and F6 Pro are debuting in the U.K. and other western markets, and India is getting the standard F6 and not the Pro variant.</p><p>The POCO F6 is available in 8GB/256GB and 12GB/512GB storage variants, and there is also a 16GB/512GB model that will be available in select regions — this is the version I&apos;m using. All variants of the F6 come with LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage modules.</p><p>What&apos;s notable is the pricing; the 8GB/256GB model of the F6 starts off at just $339, while the 12GB/512GB model is $379. The POCO F6 Pro, meanwhile, costs $449 for the 12GB/256GB model, $499 for the 16GB/512GB edition, and $579 for the 16GB/1TB version. </p><p>POCO introduced the POCO Pad alongside the two phones, and it is a rebranded version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmi-pad-pro-review">Redmi Pad Pro</a> with the same 10000mAh battery, and at $299, it is also a great bargain.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-design"><span>POCO F6: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f2iZhkRHSBpPuh2Bq7cfsc" name="poco-f6-review-7.jpg" alt="POCO F6 next to F6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2iZhkRHSBpPuh2Bq7cfsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO clearly likes to switch things up on the design front with every generation, and that&apos;s the case with the F6 as well. The brand hasn&apos;t overhauled the entire design, instead making a few tweaks that allows the F6 to differentiate itself from its predecessor. The biggest change is at the back, where the camera modules are now ensconced within massive rings, similar to that of ASUS&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RrhmdQebNDsz2ter5nD9ha" name="poco-f6-review-4.jpg" alt="Camera modules on the back of the POCO F6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrhmdQebNDsz2ter5nD9ha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LED flash module sits to the right of the two modules, and it has been similarly enlarged. The design feels cohesive if you&apos;re getting the black color variant, but if you opt for the green or titanium colors, the black-accented cameras look out of place — POCO should have color-matched the modules to the back of the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cG48ioqFsxrbDsLA9XG3Zd" name="poco-f6-review-5.jpg" alt="POCO F6 regulatory labels at the back of the device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cG48ioqFsxrbDsLA9XG3Zd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, this isn&apos;t the ugliest design on a POCO phone — far from it. The brand has had its share of misses in the past (notably the F5 Pro), and although the F6 isn&apos;t elegant, it doesn&apos;t come across as ostentatious either. What I like about the new camera modules is that they don&apos;t protrude, so there isn&apos;t too much of a wobble when using the phone on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DuSYxvTCkfP7xogKn9ZWFa" name="poco-f6-review-9.jpg" alt="IR blaster and stereo sound of the POCO F6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DuSYxvTCkfP7xogKn9ZWFa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO retained the same polycarbonate back and sides, and again, that isn&apos;t an issue at all. The back has a silky coat that minimizes smudging to an extent, and the matte texture on the sides makes it easy to hold and use the phone. The F6 is considerably light at 179g, and it has excellent weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nKUFd9x8qgDkYAKeuSeaTa" name="poco-f6-review-10.jpg" alt="Side view of POCO F6 with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nKUFd9x8qgDkYAKeuSeaTa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although it is using a plastic chassis, it doesn&apos;t feel that way when you use the device, and the build quality is outstanding. The back has a subtle curve along the sides where it meets the mid-frame, and that allows the F6 to nestle into your hand with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hLiHyNkMSHi5Tc5LrQrksa" name="poco-f6-review-11.jpg" alt="POCO F6 bottom view with USB-C and SIM tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLiHyNkMSHi5Tc5LrQrksa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t much in the way of branding at the back either; other than the POCO logo and a 50MP OIS tagline to the right, the phone is devoid of overt branding. The rest of the design is pretty standard — the power and volume buttons are on the right, the SIM card tray is at the bottom next to the USB-C port, and you get stereo sound that&apos;s plenty decent.</p>
<p>POCO now offers IP64 dust and water resistance on the F6, and that allows the device to weather the elements much better. While you still can&apos;t submerge the phone under water — that&apos;s reserved for IP67 and IP68 — it can withstand splashes of water from any side.</p>

<p>The F6 still has a 6.67-inch panel, but that&apos;s the only constant from last year. The AMOLED panel now has a higher resolution of 2712 x 1220, and it gets brighter — it is able to go up to 1200 nits in HBM mode, and 2400 nits in HDR content — and is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Victus.</p>

<p>The phone is set to the Original Colour Pro mode out of the box, and colors aren&apos;t noticeably vibrant — switching to the Vivid mode makes a big difference in daily use. As with all Xiaomi phones, the screen refresh is set to auto, and you&apos;ll need to go into the settings to manually toggle 120Hz. You can switch between 60Hz or 120Hz, and there&apos;s no option to choose 90Hz. The auto mode does a decent job switching between the two refresh rates, but I like to have 120Hz enabled all the time.</p>

<p>There&apos;s Widevine L1, and there are no issues playing 1080p content in streaming services. Xiaomi phones in general don&apos;t do a great job with Dolby Vision content, and that is the case with the POCO F6 as well. That said, the phone is terrific at gaming, and is able to play demanding titles at stable framerates. The stereo sound is good too; it isn&apos;t as detailed as high-end devices, but it is more than adequate when streaming content or casual gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qSzhkUVoLXeErLASBrrjHf" name="poco-f6-review-16.jpg" alt="POCO F6 icons on home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qSzhkUVoLXeErLASBrrjHf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get the same set of customization options as other Xiaomi and POCO phones, including always-on styles, ability to tweak colors to your preferences, and extras like Reading mode. Like most Xiaomi phones, the F6 has 1920Hz PWM dimming, and there&apos;s an optical module this time. The only issue is that the module sits a little too low on the panel, making it awkward to access when using the phone one-handed. Other than that, the F6 nails the basics.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-performance-and-battery"><span>POCO F6: Performance and battery</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="agaXUxAjVSZMsNc9sPZJsd" name="poco-f6-review-17.jpg" alt="POCO F6 about section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/agaXUxAjVSZMsNc9sPZJsd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO is betting on the latest Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 to differentiate the F6 in the mid-range segment, and there is a lot to like with the platform. You get one Cortex X4 core that goes up to 3.0GHz, and it is joined by four 2.8GHz A720 cores that handle a bulk of the performance-related tasks, and three 2.0GHz A520 cores designed to deliver efficiency.</p><p>The Adreno 735 is interesting as well, and it allows the F6 to be a gaming powerhouse; it is one of the best devices in this category at gaming. The only downside is that it gets noticeably hot in marathon gaming sessions; the F6 went up to 46.2 degrees Celsius at the back, 45 degrees around the sides, and 49.2 degrees near the camera modules.</p>

<p>The upside is that with a stability score of 97.5% in 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay stress test, the F6 is the best out of any mid-range phone I tested, and this is evident in real-world gaming scenarios as well. The phone doesn&apos;t throttle even with extended use, and you get steady framerates in visually demanding titles. It doesn&apos;t have the sheer power of the regular 8 Gen 3, but in the context of mid-range phones, it is a fantastic showing. </p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that there isn&apos;t much of a gulf between the F6 and the F6 Pro. The Pro model is powered by last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> and is better at gaming, but in real-world usage scenarios, the F6 manages to hold its own even in demanding titles. </p><p>POCO isn&apos;t shortchanging users when it comes to the memory; all variants of the F6 feature LPDDR5X RAM modules as standard as well as UFS 4.0 storage, and that is a big deal in its own right. The base model has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there&apos;s a 12GB/512GB edition that&apos;s available in most markets. POCO isn&apos;t bringing the 1TB variant outside China, and the 16GB/512GB model that I&apos;m using is similarly limited to select regions, but on the whole, the F6 has one of the best hardware packages in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xsAirScSK8eJJWKqeRW8Mb" name="poco-f6-review-12.jpg" alt="POCO F6 in-hand view showing biometric authentication" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xsAirScSK8eJJWKqeRW8Mb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That extends to connectivity as well, with the device offering Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and a good selection of AptX codecs, including AptX HD. It has dual-SIM connectivity and a decent set of 5G bands based on the region, and I didn&apos;t see any issues making calls or accessing cellular networks in the week I used the device.</p><p>The only quibble with the hardware is that the vibration motor isn&apos;t quite as good as the one on the F6 Pro; it is limited in its range, and doesn&apos;t deliver granular feedback. Outside of that, there are no problems with the F6 whatsoever.</p><p>Battery life has been terrific as well, and the phone manages to last a day and a half with ease. I didn&apos;t see the battery go below 15% even on days with heavy use, and like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones">best Xiaomi phones of 2024</a>, there is no battery anxiety whatsoever. And with the upgraded 90W charging now available, it takes just over 40 minutes to charge the F6. Thankfully, POCO continues to bundle a charger in the box.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-cameras"><span>POCO F6: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rS9infDEr5BJycPLHey58b" name="poco-f6-review-8.jpg" alt="POCO F6 in-hand view highlighting camera modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rS9infDEr5BJycPLHey58b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cameras have never been the main focus for POCO, but that&apos;s changing with the F6; the device has a 50MP f/1.6 Sony IMX882 with OIS that takes decent photos in most situations. The main camera is joined by an 8MP Sony IMX355 wide-angle lens, and at the front you get a new 20MP f/2.2 camera that uses OmniVision&apos;s OV20B40.</p><p>POCO is finally being sensible about auxiliary cameras on the F6, and the phone doesn&apos;t get the 2MP macro module that&apos;s been a mainstay on most Xiaomi phones over the last three years. Considering the ineffectiveness of that sensor, it&apos;s good to see the brand not bundling it just for marketing reasons.</p><p>The camera interface itself hasn&apos;t changed, and you&apos;ll find all the usual toggles and settings in the same location. What is new, though, is the ability to shoot 4K video at 60fps; POCO hobbled this feature on its devices for the longest time, so it&apos;s great to see that video recording isn&apos;t a limitation now. You don&apos;t get much in the way of shooting modes or effects, but the F6 has all the basics available, and honestly, that&apos;s what you&apos;ll end up using anyway.</p>

<p>Coming to daylight shots, the F6 has good dynamic range and color rendition. You don&apos;t miss out on intricate details when it comes to clouds or foliage, and colors tend to be accurate. POCO&apos;s phones tend to boost the contrast a little, and it makes the resultant photos look great on social media.</p><p>Where the F6 shines over its predecessors is low-light imagery; the phone is able to take detailed shots at night, with little to no visible noise levels. Highlights and shadows are managed well, and while the exposure is on the conservative side, you can still make out a lot of minute detail. The phone does a much better job with portrait shots as well, including those of inanimate objects.</p><p>The wide-angle lens, on the other hand, is strictly average. It does a decent enough job in scenarios with good lighting, but it doesn&apos;t have the same color balance as the main lens, and it has issues with focusing and managing noise levels in low-light.</p><p>That said, the F6 is the best showing yet from POCO, and the phone manages to deliver a similar caliber of shots as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, and that&apos;s a huge deal in and of itself.</p>

<p>There isn&apos;t much to talk about when it comes to the software side of things. The device comes with HyperOS 1.0.3.0 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and while POCO uses a customized version of the interface with custom icons, there isn&apos;t much else that&apos;s different to what you get on Xiaomi phones.</p><p>In fact, the software is identical to MIUI 14, and other than the split notification pane and a few under-the-hood changes, you don&apos;t notice anything new. The quick toggles still don&apos;t have labels, and like all Xiaomi phones I&apos;ve used this year, it continues to be annoying. There is a lot of customizability on offer, and features like flexible windows allow you to make the most out of the interface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ejoq6j9i3CWZQYudJKvEte" name="poco-f6-review-19.jpg" alt="POCO F6 notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejoq6j9i3CWZQYudJKvEte.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What is noticeable is the fluidity of the UI; it is better than the MIUI era, and it makes a difference in daily use. Outside of that, the interface has the same benefits — and foibles — as other Xiaomi phones, including annoying autostart issues and wonky push notifications. The most egregious issue is the sheer amount of bloatware on the device; most of it can be uninstalled, but the fact that Xiaomi continues to do this is plain frustrating.</p><p>As for software updates, the F6 and F6 Pro will get three updates as standard, and while that is less than the industry standard of four, it is better than what POCO guaranteed in the past. But as with other Xiaomi phones, there&apos;s no telling when you&apos;ll actually get the update; it&apos;s unlikely the phone will switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> before the end of the year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dczvhdFaLAwwistywRhqef" name="poco-f6-review-23.jpg" alt="POCO F6 next to Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dczvhdFaLAwwistywRhqef.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> continues to be a great choice in this category, particularly now that it is selling for just ₹40,999 ($492) in India. The Phone 2 also has a sublime OLED panel, powerful hardware, good battery life, and decent charging tech. Where it wins is the software; the clean interface with Nothing&apos;s extras give the phone a distinct edge, and you get two terrific cameras at the back. That said, the F6 has an advantage when it comes to value.</p><p>The OnePlus 12R is also a good recommendation; the phone is faster in daily use as well as gaming, and it has a better 50MP camera at the back along with 100W charging tech. I also like the design of the 12R quite a bit, and I prefer ColorOS to Xiaomi&apos;s software.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-should-you-buy-it"><span>POCO F6: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HZzEXKCjdN6m6NiUnaPjqg" name="poco-f6-review-21.jpg" alt="Back view of the POCO F6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HZzEXKCjdN6m6NiUnaPjqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a mid-range gaming phone</li><li>You want a vibrant AMOLED</li><li>You need a good camera at the back</li><li>You want all-day battery with ultra-fast charging</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need clean software and timely updates</li><li>You want a good wide-angle lens</li></ul>
<p>POCO didn&apos;t put a foot wrong with the F6. The phone addresses the shortcomings of its predecessor on the hardware side of things, and it is close to the F6 Pro in a lot of areas — that&apos;s why POCO isn&apos;t launching the Pro variant in countries like India.</p><p>If anything, I think the standard model is a much better deal than the F6 Pro; you still get a lot of the same features, and it isn&apos;t short on power. The F6 Pro&apos;s main camera is noticeably better than the standard model, but that&apos;s the only area where it has a distinct advantage. Otherwise, the F6 is just as good, and the value you&apos;re getting with the device is unmatched. </p><p>Ultimately, that&apos;s what makes the F6 such a good option in this category. You&apos;re getting one of the best hardware packages around, the camera is a significant upgrade from the F5, and while the software needs another overhaul, it is fluid. If you need a value-focused gaming phone that takes good photos, the F6 is now my go-to recommendation in the mid-range segment.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon is said to be upgrading Alexa with generative AI features, but it will require a new monthly subscription.</li><li>The enhanced Alexa aims to offer more conversational and context-aware interactions.</li><li>While pricing isn't finalized, there’s discussion around a potential $20 monthly fee for the AI features, separate from the $139 annual Prime subscription.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon is reportedly stepping up to compete with OpenAI and Google by boosting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-alexa">Alexa</a> with generative AI features, but it’ll cost a monthly subscription fee to access.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/amazon-plans-to-give-alexa-an-ai-overhaul-monthly-subscription-price.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, Amazon is set to launch a new generative AI-powered Alexa this year that will require its own monthly subscription, separate from Amazon Prime. This move presumably aims to put Amazon in the ring with big players like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 Omni</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Google’s Gemini 1.5</a>.</p><p>Alexa has been a handy tool for answering questions, setting reminders, and managing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> for a long time. However, it&apos;s starting to show its age, especially compared to the latest breakthroughs in AI technology.</p><p>Ever since ChatGPT made its debut in late 2022, tech giants like Microsoft and Google have been hustling to upgrade their virtual assistants with generative AI. This new technology allows for more contextual interactions and smoother conversations. Google has even rolled out its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI assistant</a>, which users can swap for the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>.</p><p>CNBC reports that the upcoming Alexa update will make it more conversational, incorporating cutting-edge generative AI. While Amazon hasn&apos;t set a price yet, it looks like this enhanced Alexa will require a separate monthly subscription beyond the annual $139 Amazon Prime fee. An insider mentioned that each generative AI query could cost around 2 cents, and there&apos;s talk of a possible $20 monthly subscription that&apos;s been discussed internally.</p><p>OpenAI and Google both offer their premium AI subscriptions for $20 a month. However, Google’s package includes extra perks like additional storage that can be used across its various products.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first hint that Amazon is planning to charge for an AI-enhanced Alexa. Last year, Amazon’s then-senior vice president of devices and services, David Limp, mentioned to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23880764/amazon-ai-alexa-generative-llm-smart-home" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that the retail giant would likely charge for a supercharged AI version of Alexa.</p><p>In his recent letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy also mentioned that an AI upgrade is on the horizon for Alexa.</p><p>The latest report aligns with what Business Insider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-working-on-premium-alexa">revealed earlier this year about Amazon&apos;s plans for Alexa</a>. The earlier report set a launch date of June 30 and dubbed the technology "Remarkable Alexa." If these details hold, Amazon&apos;s AI-powered Alexa announcement could coincide with Apple&apos;s expected reveal of an AI-enabled Siri in the same month.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pay now lets you see your credit card benefits directly in the checkout process on Chrome, helping you choose the best card based on perks like cash back or travel points.</li><li>The service is also broadening its BNPL options with Affirm and Zip, allowing you to pay in installments on more websites.</li><li>Instead of typing in security codes, Chrome and Android users can confirm their card details using biometric methods like fingerprints or facial recognition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pay has rolled out a bunch of new features, like viewing card benefits at checkout, using "buy now, pay later" options on more websites, and securing card details with biometrics or a PIN instead of security codes.</p><p>Google mentioned in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-pay-online-checkout-features/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that it&apos;s easy to forget which credit card to use since different cards offer different perks. Some might give you benefits for travel, while others are better for dining or cash back.</p><p>Now, when you pick a payment method in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> on your desktop, a drop-down menu will pop up. It lists your cards and now includes a handy description of benefits, such as the cash back percentage or point multipliers for specific categories like travel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.90%;"><img id="hhs32rSiTjYNCehAHJsUZF" name="Google-Pay-card-benefits.jpg" alt="Google Pay showing card benefits upon checkout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhs32rSiTjYNCehAHJsUZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you check out, a card might show perks like "1.5% cash back on purchases" or "3x points on flights." For the time being, this feature is only available for American Express and Capital One cards and works exclusively on the Chrome desktop browser.</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a> is extending its buy now, pay later (BNPL) feature to more websites. You can select a third-party provider like Affirm or Zip to split your payment into installments. But be cautious—missing payments can lead to collection actions or damage your credit score.</p><p>Lastly, Google is simplifying the process of confirming your card without needing the security code. Now, Chrome and Android users can verify their card details using the same method they use to unlock their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>—be it a fingerprint, face scan, or screen lock PIN. Users can also set up an option that requires them to unlock their device before their card details are displayed.</p>

<p>These updates aim to improve how consumers use Google Pay, making it a more appealing choice compared to other payment methods, like those built into retailers&apos; systems.</p>

<ul><li>Microsoft is launching a brand new mixed reality experience in Windows with Volumetric Apps on the Meta Quest platform.</li><li>Developers can sign up to preview the new development API, allowing them to bring their existing apps into 3D space.</li><li>Microsoft says that its example app, Creo, took only a single day to turn into a Volumetric App with the new API.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Microsoft may have pulled the plug on its Windows Mixed Reality VR platform at the end of 2023, but the company continues to invest in other VR platforms with yet another new announcement. The company says that Volumetric Apps, its answer to Apple&apos;s Spatial apps, will be coming to Meta Quest headsets via the Windows platform in the near future.</p><p>Developers can sign up for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.co/ru5kdOmtqW">Volumetric Apps API</a> and be among the first to migrate apps into a spatial environment, making it easier for customers to interface with them while wearing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> headset.</p><p>Microsoft showed off the new API at Build 2024, its annual developer conference, but kept the presentation short. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1792974464424317307">one-minute demo</a>, Microsoft showed off Creo, a CAD-based engineering software, along with the user manipulating and customizing an Xbox controller in 3D space.</p>

<p>Microsoft says that Volumetric Apps will be coming to the Meta Quest platform, suggesting that the company is further enhancing its relationship with Meta and potentially providing a Quest-exclusive way to run Windows.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft announced that Meta Quest 3 users will be able to use Windows 11 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-oculus-quest-is-getting-windows-11-and-microsoft-office">from the headset</a> but has yet to reveal more specific plans. Presumably, Microsoft will utilize Meta&apos;s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/">Quest Link</a> software so users can connect to their PCs either wirelessly or via a USB-C cable.</p><p>In addition to Volumetric Apps, Meta Quest owners can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xbox-game-pass-meta-quest-launch">stream Xbox Game Pass</a> to their headsets and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/microsoft-office-is-finally-available-on-meta-quest-headsets">use Microsoft Office</a>. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">limited edition Xbox-branded Meta Quest headset</a> is also expected to arrive sometime later this year.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a stylish, premium-feeling smartphone with excellent performance and battery life; you like to buy your phones unlocked. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want the absolute best camera technology on the market (if so, look towards Google or Samsung); you&apos;re looking for a trade-in deal. </p><p>As senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda stated in his glowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12 review</a>, this flagship phone easily "holds its own against the best that Samsung, Xiaomi, and Google have to offer". You get a truly stunning 120Hz OLED display with two days of battery life on a single charge, plus some great camera tech and five years of software updates guaranteed. </p><p>Sure, you could spend a little more on a Galaxy S24 Ultra or Pixel 8 Pro and receive marginally better camera tech and some newfangled AI features, but if you don&apos;t need all of those bells and whistles, you&apos;ll enjoy an equally-great experience for considerably less cash by going with the OnePlus 12. </p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, this offer really only makes sense for folks who like to buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">unlocked phones</a>.

Inside, users will notice an emoji smile (icon) on the far left of the text box. The far right will now display a gallery and a plus icon, which opens the sub-menu for your gallery, GIF search, stickers, files, and more.</p><p>However, once you begin typing, the gallery icon disappears, leaving the plus icon ready to open up that secondary panel.</p>

<p>Curiously, 9to5 notes that while the update has been seen more widely, users on the stable version of Messages still have the old look. The previous single-line field design slid the box over to the right, giving ample space for auxiliary icons. Our internal tests with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> show that the right-aligned text field is still active in stable mode.</p><p>If you&apos;re also seeing this, continue to check for updates for Messages as we enter the later portion of the week.</p><p>With this slight redesign arriving for the stable app version, Google has started a test for beta testers, which involves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-text-editing-beta-changes-spotted">a text edit button</a>. Long-pressing a recently sent text will produce a pencil (edit) icon on the top bar. Users can quickly correct any mistakes, which will be reflected on the other parties&apos; devices. Note: users have a shorter 15-minute time limit to edit texts, instead of 30, as previously seen.</p><p>May also held the debut of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-starts-getting-voice-moods-and-recorder-redesign">Voice Moods</a>" in Messages. Users can access nine voice moods alongside relevant emojis to tack onto it. The cards users see in their messaging threads are colorful and fun, with emojis plastered all around them.</p>
