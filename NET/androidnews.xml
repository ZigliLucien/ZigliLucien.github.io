<hr>
<p>OnePlus debuted a new wearable in China, dubbed the "Watch 2," and its specifications look similar to the current 2024 model.</p><p>The company announced the OnePlus Watch 2 launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3871046669/OkYyNziZV?pagetype=profilefeed">on Weibo</a> following its presentation today (June 27). From its official pre-order listing, OnePlus states the Watch 2 features a 1.43-inch AMOLED display. Powering the device is Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> SoC, which is the same as the current overseas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>.</p><p>A (machine-translated) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3871046669/OkXGDlAQb">subsequent post</a> highlights what sets this device apart: independent eSIM (LTE) support. OnePlus states that its Watch 2 will let users answer and send messages and calls without grabbing their Android phone. Moreover, the company states it has improved the watch&apos;s map navigation, creating a more intuitive and "secure" environment.</p><p>For workouts, the Watch 2 packs "high-precision" sensors on its back to assist the user in obtaining "accurate" fitness data.</p><p>The device contains a few features aimed at convenience, such as falling asleep with the watch on, which will "automatically pause music." The Watch 2 can search for your paired smartphone if you&apos;ve misplaced it, vibrate for reminders, and take photos remotely with the push of a button.</p><p>Another difference is the new Watch 2 in China offers a circular dial around its watch face instead of the full glass design from earlier this year. OnePlus also includes two raised physical buttons on the side, sliding away from the raised vertical edge.</p>

<p>Other specifications see the device offering a RAM/storage configuration of 2/32GB. Keeping the Watch 2 running is a 500mAh battery. OnePlus adds that the smartwatch supports Android (Wear OS), alongside iOS devices.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2 is available for pre-order in China for Â¥1,749, which is roughly $247. The company adds that the device will hit the shelves on July 3 on home soil.</p><p>Whether folks overseas will see this device is still unclear. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/27/oneplus-watch-2-china-updated-design-lte/">9to5Google</a> notes that there have been rumors that China&apos;s OnePlus Watch 2 could be rebranded as the "Watch 2R" overseas. The "R" moniker is typically how OnePlus rebrands its devices when making them available outside of China.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 27), Amazon announced its new partnership with Xbox as it looks to bring cloud gaming capabilities to its streaming product.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/xbox-gaming-on-amazon-fire-tv">press release</a>, Amazon stated that Xbox players could enjoy the Game Pass Ultimate library on their TV in July with a "compatible" Fire TV Stick. Users must download the Xbox app through the Amazon app store to get started, alongside their Microsoft account credentials.</p><p>If users are already an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, the entire library will be accessible. If not, Amazon will prompt them to sign up to begin enjoying its cloud gaming privileges.</p><p>The company states that its cloud gaming capabilities through the Fire TV Stick enable gamers to enjoy graphic-intensive titles like Senua&apos;s Saga: Hellblade II, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76.</p><p>Amazon adds that a "solid internet connection" is required to maximize its full gaming possibilities.</p><p>Additionally, games can be played with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gaming-controllers-amazon-fire-tv">Bluetooth-capable controller</a>. The post states such devices include the Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, and PlayStation&apos;s DualSense and DualShock 4 controllers.</p>

Pricing starts at $49.99, and each stick offers 4K resolution, a remote controller for comfort, and more.

<p>Samsung is prepping for its foldables launch, which is now only a couple of weeks away, and we are finally moving away from renderings to official image leaks.

<p>The cases match the deviceâs color options; for instance, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes in gray, silver, and navy blue colorways, and the protective cases complement the handset. Some of the cases also include support for the S-Pen. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 seems to be coming in sea green and accompanied by the same colored key holder case alongside other gray and navy blue colorways.</p><p>The rest of the devices resemble the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a> models. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes again with the same folder-icon-shaped cover screen with dual primary cameras placed right next to it. Interestingly, the rings surrounding the camera lenses also match the deviceâs color accent, giving a comprehensive look.</p>

<p>The device is said to carry a new design this year, including sharp edges instead of rounded corners, as seen in the previous iteration. The exact design change can also be spotted in the aforementioned images. The cover screen is also expected to be wider than the predecessor; however, that isn&apos;t rightly visible in the casesâ images.</p><p>While we await the launch alongside the case renders, alleged official images of the other product portfolio, such as the Galaxy Watch 7, the new Watch 7 Ultra, and the new Galaxy Buds 3, have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-buds-3-series-render-leak">popped up on the internet</a>.</p>

<ul><li>A Xiaomi representative confirmed that the company would only use AMOLED panels on flagship Redmi phones in the future.</li><li>The decision was made despite the same executive being sensitive to display flicker, something AMOLED suffers from.</li><li>Fewer companies are using LCDs despite growing concerns over negative health effects caused by display flickering.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Proponents of LCD panels have lost yet another battle today as Redmi confirms that flagship phones will only feature AMOLED panels going forward. This includes the Redmi Note and Redmi K series, but the most isn&apos;t all that surprising considering these phones haven&apos;t used LCD panels for several years.</p><p>What is surprising is how the news was delivered. Redmi Marketing Manager Ethan Zhang Yu posted the news on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5049138127308491">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xiaomitime.com/redmi-announces-it-will-no-longer-use-lcd-screens-5180/">XiaomiTime</a>), expressing his condolences to all the LCD fans who have been asking to make another flagship with an LCD panel for years. In the message (translated below by Microsoft Copilot), Zhang notes that he is a flicker-sensitive user and can understand these requests very well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.37%;"><img id="b5RFGCmEBoX7HmLc3k5suR" name="weibo-screenshot-redmi-ethan-zhang-yu-lcd.png" alt="A screenshot of a post from Xiaomi's Ethan Zhang Yu announcing the company would no longer use LCD panels in flagship phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5RFGCmEBoX7HmLc3k5suR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="778" height="353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, while Zhang empathizes with other flicker-sensitive users, he admits that LCD is no longer seen as a flagship phone-worthy technology. Ironically, this means that Zhang cannot use the phones Xiaomi produces under its Redmi brand.</p><p>Additionally, Zhang briefly discusses how picking a display panel for a smartphone isn&apos;t as simple as "swapping it out" for a different one and that display panels are a deep part of a phone&apos;s engineering.</p>
<p>LCD fans, or even folks that need an LCD due to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, shouldn&apos;t hope for a special version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-long-term-review">the latest Redmi Note</a>, according to Zhang. While OLED technology delivers better black levels, deeper contrast ratios, and significantly better-viewing angles, the display tech is prone to long-term burn-in and flickers in a way LCD technology does not. It also means that users are looking directly at LED diodes, providing a harsher form of light than LCD&apos;s traditionally diffused back or side lighting.</p><p>This begs the question: what are flicker-sensitive users supposed to do if companies no longer offer smartphones they can physically use? Flicker sensitivity is a disability like any other and one that has become increasingly difficult to deal with as more LEDs make their way into the world.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="He3dCDqACwDxikH7EWPPNF" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-moto-razr-plus-cover-screen-apps.jpg" alt="Comparing apps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's cover screen with the Motorola Razr Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/He3dCDqACwDxikH7EWPPNF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While LED technology like OLED, AMOLED, LCD, and even the lights in your home don&apos;t <em>need</em> to strobe on and off, the fact of the matter is that many manufacturers have turned to what&apos;s known as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to manage LED brightness levels.</p><p>In a nutshell, many OLED panels and some LED lights rapidly turn on and off hundreds or thousands of times per second. While human eyeballs cannot "see" this rapid flickering, human brains perceive the flickering as a source of light depending on how long the LED is kept on during this flickering cycle.</p><p>As with anything else brain-related, everyone is different, and some people experience severe pain when looking at these lights. Unfortunately, I&apos;m one of those people.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Most people â tech journalists included â have never heard of PWM and have no idea that OLED panels flicker.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I spoke with Bill Maffucci, vice president at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kopin-corporation/">Kopin Corporation</a>, about the differences between LCD and OLED display technology. More specifically, I wanted to know why OLED displays always flicker a bit, even when they don&apos;t use pulse width modulation to control brightness. His answer was quite illuminating.</p><p>âWith an LCD panel, the backlight is energized during the entire frame, and you, therefore, would not experience a change in brightness during the frame. Â With an OLED, the individual pixels emit light when first energized by the video signal and then decay over time until energized in the next frame. Â The strong dip that occurs at the end of the frame appears to be the equivalent of a CRT âvertical retraceâ period when the raster resets to the top of the display.â</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Part of the problem is that AMOLED and OLED technology has been pushed as a superior tech without properly explaining the potential negative health effects associated with it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In other words, OLED displays need a constant "fresh injection" of voltage to achieve a uniform level of brightness, while LCDs are better at delivering a consistent level of brightness.</p><p>Some companies have worked to fix this problem by increasing the pulse rate to thousands of hertz, thereby reducing the number of people negatively affected. It&apos;s not a fix-all for everyone, but it does help significantly compared to the 240hz or 480hz used on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Only a few companies, like TCL, still offer LCD panels on their flagship devices, often angling them as more vision-friendly. For example, the TCL Tab 10 NXTPAPER tablet pictured below uses a "paper-like" matte finish to help diffuse light from the panel in a way that looks more natural to human eyes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5165px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="mGzKDqVZCdNmPt2bNJrQ4Z" name="tcl-tab10-nxtpaper-with-box.jpg" alt="The TCL Tab 10 NXTPAPER 5G with its retail box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mGzKDqVZCdNmPt2bNJrQ4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5165" height="2909" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of the problem is that AMOLED and OLED technology has been pushed as a superior tech without properly explaining the potential negative health effects associated with it. Most people â tech journalists included â have never heard of PWM and have no idea that OLED panels flicker.</p><p>I found out this truth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">about a year ago</a> as my headaches and symptoms of nausea increased with newer smartphones. Thankfully, since then, the smartphone and display industries have started shifting to friendlier methods of dimming. The list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-phones-for-pwm-flicker-sensitive">best phones for PWM sensitive people</a> is now far more respectable than even just a year ago because of heightened awareness, but progress still needs to be made.</p><p>Companies like Google, Samsung, and Apple are the worst offenders of using harsh display tech among smartphone manufacturers and continue to use low PWM rates that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/ssl-miller-etal-2023-LRT-pae-se%20visibility-tlm%20parameters.pdf">do not abide by research</a> showing how harmful they can be to humans.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Companies like Motorola, Honor, OnePlus, and plenty of others have added flicker-reduction options to OLED phones and it's just the responsible thing to do.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If companies continue to switch to OLED en masse, at least one of three things needs to happen. First, it&apos;s imperative that companies like Samsung, Google, and Apple adopt flicker-reduction options for flicker-sensitive users. Even laptops <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LROGwzyJYZQ">like the Galaxybook 4 Edge</a> have horrendously low PWM rates and feature other harsh flickering effects like temporal dithering.</p><p>If there&apos;s no way to turn this stuff off, these companies are quite literally telling people that they don&apos;t want their business. It&apos;s rotten. Companies like Motorola, Honor, OnePlus, and plenty of others have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">added flicker-reduction options</a> to OLED phones and it&apos;s just the responsible thing to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="E4RUvQBreVopxndys8LfTE" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-pwm-display-settings-01.jpg" alt="Taking a look at the PWM rate of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4RUvQBreVopxndys8LfTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other two action items are far less likely and almost certainly not going to happen. One, companies could offer to support LCD panel phones for longer, enabling flicker-sensitive users to use modern devices still until a better solution comes along. Heck, offer a subscription model so that users who need it can offer monetary compensation so companies can have developers support devices long term.</p><p>Lastlyâand I know this one isn&apos;t going to happenâstart informing people of the potential negative side effects of using OLED technology over other types of display technology.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to accept OLED as the "clearly superior" technology when burn-in is still a substantial problem â look at my 2017 LG OLED TV to see this in action â and the potential to cause headaches, nausea, and other related issues is entirely possible. Every type of technology has trade-offs, and it&apos;s important to be informed about them. It&apos;s a shame that companies like Samsung Display don&apos;t seem concerned with offering up the truth.</p>

<ul><li>Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger are experiencing a partial outage impacting Â most of its users.</li><li>Sending and receiving Multimedia messages including photos, videos and voice notes seem to be at the center of this outage.</li><li>Whatsapp said in a tweet that it is working on fixing the issue and some users have already started to see services return to normal on their device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier today, users across two Meta platforms reported disruptions in sending or receiving Multimedia messages and voice notes on WhatsApp and Messenger.Â </p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/27/whatsapp-messenger-picture-media-upload-outage/">9to5Google</a>, the outage began around 12 p.m. ET on Monday (June 27). It affected both services and seemed to have peaked for 82% of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/whatsapp/">Whatsapp users</a> and 79% of users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.ca/status/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a> at approximately 1 p.m. ET.Â </p><p>Several users have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/WhatsApp/status/1806367401899892948">taken to X to express</a> frustration about the ongoing outage. Â Â </p><p>However, it is important to note that regular text messages were not impacted by the outage. For those experiencing it, pictures, videos, and voice messages fail to upload onto the platform or are stuck endlessly loading.Â </p><p>Android Central&apos;s staff tried using WhatsApp to send an image, but it took a couple of minutes to go through rather than instantly being delivered to the user. Meanwhile, WhatsApp also took X to state that it was aware of the ongoing issue and was working on resolving it.Â </p><p>Some users are already seeing services return to normal, and the situation is expected to improve in the next couple of hours.</p>

<hr>
<p>Another batch of leaked imagery seems to have spilled four of Samsung&apos;s upcoming products and their notable differences.</p><p>The images posted on X by known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1806344206186672512">Evan Blass</a> showcase the Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Buds 3 series. Leading off the leak is likely the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra with a rugged orange band and an up-close shot of its face. The rendering follows a trend we&apos;ve heard continuously that Samsung is opting for a squarish body with a circular watch face atop it.</p><p>In this orange hue, the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra features orange accents around its dial and in the center of one of its two (pushable) physical buttons. The render highlights that third physical interactable, which appears to rotate. All in all, Samsung&apos;s new Watch design shifts it closer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple&apos;s behavior</a>.</p><p>The leak includes a look at the base Galaxy Watch 7 with a design that looks similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6</a>. The image shows off the device sporting a rugged band of its own in a forest green color.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the new buds leak seems to be from the base and Pro models. If our speculation is correct, the base Buds 3 notably lacks the silicone tip to help sit comfortably inside an ear. Instead, users may have to settle with Samsung&apos;s new stem stabilizer to help keep the vanilla Buds from falling out.</p><p>The assumed Buds 3 Pro features a silicone tip for in-ear use and sports a silver (or gray) colorway. The leaked rendering shows the device inside a new case design with blue and orange lights, likely indicators of each bud&apos;s recharge progress.</p><p>Leaked renders of the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra over the past few months have sung the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">same design-change tune</a>. It&apos;s beginning to seem likely that this is the design Samsung intends to debut next month. Previous leaks suggest the device will contain a 1.5-inch display diameter, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, but with slightly bigger dimensions at 47 x 47.14 x 16.4mm.</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-apple-like-redesign-leak">a pixelated look</a> at some assumed Samsung promotional material spoiled the design of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. That rendering showed what we&apos;ve continued to see, a gray-colored set of buds with a stem like Apple&apos;s AirPods. However, the alleged look at the base model is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">sharp departure from old</a> as consumers may experience a new design with no ear tips.</p><p>Regardless, Samsung announced that its Unpacked event will take place on July 10 in Paris, France, at 9 am EDT. Interested parties can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">reserve any of its new Galaxy products</a> and receive $50 of in-store credit.</p>

<p>I still remember playing the game long ago on my Windows 95 machine, blown away by the pre-rendered CG visuals that confounded me as often as the puzzles did. It&apos;s this deeply immersive nature of the world that ensures playing in VR feels cathartic in a way the flat-screen version simply cannot. Riven&apos;s classic design works best for players who are willing to look over, under, and around objects to look for the many cryptic clues scattered around the world.</p><p>But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6499813506711202/">Riven</a> also suffers from a problem that only occurs in VR: you can&apos;t touch everything. Players on flat-screen systems don&apos;t expect to pick up every gadget and doohickey on a table, and they certainly don&apos;t expect to climb walls or scale 2-foot-high ledges if the game doesn&apos;t allow them to.</p><p>But VR players do, and that&apos;s where an otherwise brilliant port falls abruptly on its proverbial face.</p>

<p>As I made my way into Gehn&apos;s Laboratory, I was ecstatic to see all the interesting tools and scientific gadgets lying around. I&apos;d read Ghen&apos;s notes nearly 30 years ago now and couldn&apos;t wait to find out what else was cooking in the eclectic tower of mysteries from my memory.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Most of the tools and gadgets found in the tower are as static as the visuals from the 27-year-old original release.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The problem is that most of the tools and gadgets found in the tower are as static as the visuals from the 27-year-old original release. An adventure puzzle game like Riven typically thrives on only allowing users to interact with what&apos;s necessary in order to keep the player from feeling confused or lost along the way. After all, who wants to pick up a random screwdriver that has no actual use in the game? That&apos;s just a recipe for frustration.</p><p>As a VR gamer, I&apos;ve become accustomed to picking up anything and everything I see lying about in a game&apos;s world, even if there is no purpose. See a pot? I&apos;ve definitely got to smash it. How about a ball? I&apos;ll be throwing it as far as humanly possible to see what it can hit. Being physically present in a worldâeven if that physicality is virtualâmakes me want to be a part of that world and interact with it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.44%;"><img id="ycUtcKi78YSzLbFru7X83h" name="riven-interact.gif" alt="Attempting to grab objects in Riven on Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycUtcKi78YSzLbFru7X83h.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="254" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Virtually any genre can work as a VR game, but mechanics need to be redesigned around VR's inherent enhanced interaction paradigms.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But this isn&apos;t something you&apos;ll do all that often in Riven, and the experience is unnecessarily frustrating because of the limitations. Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is still the same brilliant remake of the classic you can play on other systems, and that in and of itself is a triumph. It&apos;s no small feat to cram Riven&apos;s gorgeous visuals onto a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and make it still look good.</p><p>This is where my conundrum lies. I&apos;m a big advocate for hybrid AAA games, defined as a game that&apos;s been developed to work on flat screens <em>and</em> VR systems. This method works for a lot of games including action-heavy titles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/resident-evil-4-vr-review">Resident Evil 4 VR</a>, platformers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/max-mustard-vr-platformer-debut">Max Mustard</a>, and especially racing games like Gran Turismo 7 on the PSVR 2.</p><p>While the formula certainly works well enough for Rivenâparticularly with its brilliant notebook system that lets you take and store screenshots for later puzzle referenceâI can&apos;t help but wish that some of the puzzles were redesigned specifically for the VR version.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ui3GSS5JfvhezGFXkbm2yH" name="riven-meta-quest-3-screenshot-02.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Riven for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ui3GSS5JfvhezGFXkbm2yH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Cyan)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I played through a good chunk of Riven, I regularly found myself getting fed up with the game&apos;s limitations. What feels like a clever puzzle on my Steam Deck is just annoying while playing in VR. Heading down to one of the game&apos;s hidden mines lets you grab a pickaxe to unearth a fire marble, but you can only mine one marble, and there&apos;s no further use for the pickaxe beyond this 5-second interaction.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Too many of the game's puzzles and interactions feel sloppy in VR due a lack of bespoke VR game design.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Riven&apos;s structure isn&apos;t anything like Minecraft or any other mining-and-building game, but the presence of a pickaxe makes me want to take it elsewhere and see what I can find with its utility.</p><p>Likewise, walking around the volcano island with unclimbable 2-foot walls all around me is monumentally irritating. Flat-screen players will no doubt marvel at the water shader quality or the stunning architecture all around, but I want to climb those little ledges and see what&apos;s in the water or, at least, on the other side of the pond.</p><p>There&apos;s another puzzle where you enter an area that has a boat floating on the pond. On the boat, you&apos;ll find an oar. Logically, I expect to pick up this oar and paddle myself to the other side, but Riven isn&apos;t a game that usually gives you direct control of vehicles like this. Again, this is another puzzle that just feels wrong in VR because of the level of assumed interaction that should be possible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YBWwkasPrNnyCCK2jcPkBi" name="riven-climb.gif" alt="Walking in Riven on Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YBWwkasPrNnyCCK2jcPkBi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Riven ends up feeling a lot like an unmodded version of Skyrim or Fallout 4 VR, games that were ported to VR but didn&apos;t receive a proper VR overhaul. In Fallout 4 VR, for example, you&apos;ll look at something and press a button to interact with it. While it&apos;s nice to have these games in VR for the immersion factor, it&apos;s mostly pointless if we&apos;re not going to get a full interaction overhaul.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Even made-for-VR games can suffer from the same design problems.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Otherwise, I&apos;m just scratching my head while trying to grab anything that is an actual object in the room rather than just a pretty decoration. If you really want to experience the world of Riven through your own eyes, this is certainly a brilliant way to do that, but the difficulty of implementing grabbable objects and other VR-centric mechanics shows how difficult hybrid-AAA development can be.</p><p>I don&apos;t intend to pick on Riven here, as even some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> are guilty of these design flaws. Jurassic World Aftermath is one of the foremost examples, as I pointed out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/jurassic-world-aftermath-review">my review of the game</a> several years back, but the lack of object interaction doesn&apos;t cause undue irritation with the game&apos;s design.</p>
<h2 id="is-hybrid-aaa-even-feasible-2">Is Hybrid AAA even feasible?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="enAvvDoX7bfD6T59wThNRF" name="resident-evil-4-vr-review-1.jpg" alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/enAvvDoX7bfD6T59wThNRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That leads me to wonder if hybrid AAA games are even a feasible concept outside of a choice few examples. The most successful hybrid games are often ones designed separately, having separate teams working on VR systems implementations and the odd intricacies required to make a game feel good in VR.</p><p>The recent Resident Evil VR releases are perfect examples of this. RE4 VR was released on Quest 2 back in 2021 and was redesigned from the ground up by Armature, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-studios">first-party Oculus Studios</a> developers on Meta&apos;s payroll. Likewise, the ports of Resident Evil 4 Remake VR and Resident Evil Village VR were monetarily encouraged by Sony as a second-tier development to bolster the PSVR 2&apos;s short list of exclusive games.</p><p>All of these titles were developed separately from the main release, and all of them exhibit excellent design built specifically around VR&apos;s unique interaction possibilities and mechanics. While Riven&apos;s VR port certainly isn&apos;t a second-class release, it would have been better with some changes and a later release.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Studios like Flat2VR are working toward making official VR ports of existing flat games, ensuring bespoke mechanics and implementation for VR interaction.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Thankfully, studios like Flat2VR are working toward making <em>official</em> VR ports of existing flat games, and I think this particular angle is what will ultimately make hybrid AAA development the most successful. The group regularly puts out videos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@flat2vr">on its YouTube channel</a> for popular big-name flat screen games often using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uevr.io/">UEVR tool</a>.</p><p>In fact, this very group is now an "official studio" working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/flat2vr-studios-hires-talented-vr-modders-for-licensed-quest-ports">licensed ports of popular games</a>, all remade with bespoke VR controls and interactions. Groups like Flat2VR are the best hope for hybrid AAA games that look and feel the part, as their unique set of skills and expertise gives them the perspective needed to avoid design pitfalls that might make a VR port feel half-baked.</p><p>I absolutely want to see more hybrid-AAA games happen in the future, but Riven is proof positive that I need to tender my expectations, depending on the game.</p><p>I&apos;m impressed with developer Cyan for bringing such a brilliant remake of an equally brilliant classic to VR on day one. I just wish a little more was done to make it feel like a VR game instead of a port of a flat game.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I started using Authy to manage my 2FA tokens well over a half decade ago; I used Google Authenticator previously, but as I was starting to switch devices regularly, I needed a solution that works across several devices, iOS, and Windows. To its credit, Authy offered everything I needed of a 2FA client, so I moved all of my tokens to the service, and it has been hassle-free â until now.</p><p>Authy stores 2FA tokens associated with your account on its servers, and you&apos;ll need to set up a backup password to decrypt accounts when moving to a new device. The backup password isn&apos;t stored anywhere, and while there have been a few glitches in the past when the password wasn&apos;t recognized on a new device, resetting it on the older device and keying in the new one always did the trick.</p><p>But that dynamic changed earlier this week. I was switching away from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a> to Vivo&apos;s X100 Ultra, and when I tried to enter the backup password in Authy, it said the credentials were incorrect. So I reset them on the 8 Pro, and entered the details again on the X100 Ultra, to no avail. I figured there must be an issue with the package, so I uninstalled Authy and did a reinstall, but the same issue remained.</p>
<p>I switch between devices every two weeks on average, and logging in to Authy on a new phone is as routine as backing up photos while configuring a new device. So I went back to a phone I was using last month (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a>) and pulled up Authy on that device to see if the new password would take. Again, the service said the password was incorrect, and no amount of clearing cache/data and reinstalling made a difference.</p><p>I have been mulling a switch to another 2FA service for a while now, but kept putting it off because of the hassle involved. While other 2FA providers make it easy to transfer data, Authy doesn&apos;t have that provision â in that sense, it is the Evernote of 2FA clients. This meant that I had to manually reconfigure 2FA on all of my accounts to move to another service.</p>

<p>When it comes to choosing an alternative, there are lots of great choices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis Authenticator</a> ticks a lot of the right boxes, but it doesn&apos;t work for my own use case as I need something that syncs across devices seamlessly. That&apos;s why I switched to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://2fas.com/">2FAS</a>; the service is free and open source, has a browser extension that&apos;s ideal on Windows, and syncs via Google Drive, making it extremely easy to set up when moving to a new phone.</p><p>The best part is that you don&apos;t need to furnish a phone number to use the service, and if you want to stay anonymous, you don&apos;t need to use Drive sync. The only issue in my usage is that as it relies on Drive, you cannot set it up on iOS â this is the same issue with WhatsApp. That said, you can easily back up all 2FA tokens to a file, and use that while setting up 2FAS on an iPhone â that&apos;s what I did, and it works seamlessly.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that 2FAS has a clean design, and you get a widget on both Android and iOS. It excels at providing time-based one-time passwords for your accounts, and does so without needing you to share any unnecessary details. Combine that with the ease of use and its ability to work across devices, and it is now my go-to 2FA recommendation.</p>

<hr>
<p>To streamline its document management tools, Google is discontinuing "Stack: PDF Scanner" later this year, phasing out the app known for its scanning and organization features.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/15128833" target="_blank">community post</a>, a Google spokesperson confirmed that Stack: PDF Scanner has been permanently discontinued. The app will stop functioning entirely on September 23, and its listing has already been removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Store</a>. This marks the definitive end of the document scanning app.</p><p>The rationale for shuttering the app seems logical. It was developed by Google&apos;s internal Area 120 incubator, which no longer exists. Stack <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-area-120-develops-stack-document-scanner">stood out for its user-friendly design</a>. The app featured automatic edge detection and document capture, making scanning super easy with minimal effort. It also had a handy automated document categorization system. However, Google insists that these features are now integrated into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>, making Stack unnecessary.</p><p>In November, the Drive app received a dedicated "Scan" function, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/25/google-stack-pdf-scanner/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This new feature includes a custom viewfinder for better document alignment and more intuitive controls for a seamless scanning process.</p><p>The "Auto capture" mode automatically takes a picture when the document is optimally positioned, removing the need for manual clicks. There&apos;s also a manual capture mode if you want to do things your way.</p><p>Using machine learning, Google Drive suggests relevant titles for scanned documents. For instance, when scanning a receipt, Drive might automatically add the store location and date.</p><p>The latest change marks a significant step in consolidating document management within Drive. Users can now rely on this all-in-one platform for scanning and organizing their important documents.</p>

<p>This strategic move aligns with Google&apos;s broader goal of streamlining its services.</p><p>To make things easier for Stack users, Google has set up a simple way to move everything over to Drive. If you&apos;re used to using Stack, you can find an "Export all documents to Drive" option in the app&apos;s account settings. This makes it a breeze to transfer all your documents to a specific folder in Drive, so the switch is smooth and hassle-free.</p>
