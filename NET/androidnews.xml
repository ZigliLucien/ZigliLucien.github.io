This economy-level tablet features 64GB of storage and a microSD slot for those who need more. It also comes with a headphone jack, a 10.4-inch LCD screen, and a lightweight, simple design.</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't call the S6 Lite one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" target="_blank">best Android tablets</a>, but it's enough to get the job done for most casual users. With an extra $110 off, Amazon has made this cheap tablet even more appealing to those who want a deal and don't need peak performance. The major selling points for the S6 Lite include its impressively long battery life, the inclusion of the Samsung S Pen, and its lightweight, minimal design.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>battery life is a major selling point for you; you want a good deal on a tablet that also comes with the Samsung S Pen; you&apos;re looking for something with at least 64GB of storage and the option to expand that.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you think you may be better off just going with an iPad; you require a tablet with industry-leading performance.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-review">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite</a> features the same size battery as the company&apos;s regular Galaxy Tab S6, but the lower-resolution display and other less power-intensive hardware give the S6 Lite superb battery life. This model comes with 64GB of storage on its own, as well as expandable storage of up to 512GB with the use of the microSD slot. The included S Pen also magnetically attaches to the side of the tablet, which is just plain old fun.</p><p>To be sure, the S6 Lite isn&apos;t a premium-level tablet, as evidenced by the general latency you&apos;ll experience when switching from one app to the next or trying to run games. Still, if you&apos;re a casual tablet user and you&apos;re just looking for something cheap, this deal might not be a bad option for you.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube has a new feature for Premium users in the testing phase.</li><li>Dubbed Sleep Timer, it works similarly to what we have seen on the YouTube Music app.</li><li>It allows users to pause the playback after a certain period of time, ranging from 10 minutes to one hour.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A sleep timer in an app is a lifesaver, especially for media apps. While plenty of music apps already have this handy feature, Google is now experimenting with it for YouTube.</p><p>The feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">currently available</a> for YouTube Premium subscribers and works similarly to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> app. Users can select any random video on YouTube, hit play, and head to the little settings icon where they can find the new "Sleep timer" option.</p>

<p>Digging in further gives them a few options, like the ability to select several minutes ranging from 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. You can also sync it up with the video&apos;s run time.</p><p>This new feature is especially handy for those who love to watch videos or stream playlists before bed—it’s perfect if you tend to doze off mid-play. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/09/youtube-is-now-testing-a-built-in-sleep-timer-but-only-with-premium-subscribers/">9to5Google notes</a>, the best part is that it won’t mess up your watch history or mess with future recommendations from the platform.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the feature is currently experimental, and YouTube allows Premium subscribers to test it out until September 2.</p><p>You can find this feature on both the mobile and web versions of the platform. If the feedback is good—and it probably will be, given how useful this feature is—it’s likely to roll out for everyone soon.</p><p>YouTube has been testing several new features lately, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tests-less-disruptive-mid-roll-ads">most recent one</a> being intended to help creators serve up less disruptive ads. The service is experimenting with picture-in-picture (PiP) mid-roll ads, where the content shrinks into PiP mode while the ad takes over most of the screen—or possibly the reverse. You can spot this new option under "Monetization" in the Live Control Room.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung reportedly delayed its One UI 7 beta rollout last month, and now, the delays are set to impact the upgrade's official rollout.</li><li>The new reports say that the rollout has been "delayed indefinitely" and there isn't even a concrete beta testing schedule for the Android 15-based One UI 7.</li><li>The news comes following an earlier report that Google is likely to ship the Pixel 9 series with Android 14, not Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung typically releases new One UI updates, which are based on the latest version of Android, in the fall for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones</a>. However, if the reports are any indication, Samsung&apos;s development and testing of One UI 7 haven&apos;t gone according to plan. We expected to see official information, and perhaps a beta, for One UI 7 at the end of last month. Instead, we got nothing, and now the situation appears to be getting worse.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/07/samsung-android-15-update-delay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, two reliable Android tipsters are now saying that One UI 7 is delayed, and the public rollout could be affected. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1820356963714335226" target="_blank">Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter)</a> said "there are still no plans to launch it in the near future." By comparison, the One UI 6 beta rolled out to the Galaxy S23 series in the U.S. and a few other regions around this time last year.</p>

When we first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">reported on the apparent One UI 7 beta delay in late July</a>, it was thought that Samsung was prioritizing One UI 6.1.1 development ahead of One UI 7. Or, that instability issues with One UI 7 were holding things up. Now, it&apos;s unclear what exactly is the cause for Samsung&apos;s delay.</p>

<p>The good news for Samsung is that it isn&apos;t the only company delaying the release of Android 15. Google&apos;s Pixel and earlier Nexus brands have typically ushered in new versions of Android. However, that might be changing this year. Reports indicate that the four new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series phones launching at the Made by Google event this week will ship with Android 14, not Android 15. That big update will come later in a shocking move, if the leaks are correct.</p><p>Of course, the delay somewhat makes sense for Google. Although the Android 15 beta is nearing the platform stability stage of development, we have to remember that the Pixel 9 series is launching a whole two months earlier than usual. That would explain why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> isn&apos;t ready for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. </p><p>Still, this sets up a situation where both Google and Samsung are releasing their software updates on an abnormal timetable, and it&apos;s going to affect consumers and the market in a real way.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2nvETLDpK7ckzSSrSsXF5" name="android-14-logo-samsung-4.jpg" alt="Android 14 logo on a Galaxy S23 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2nvETLDpK7ckzSSrSsXF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google and Samsung both promised seven years of software updates with the Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24 series, respectively. Presumably, the companies will at least match that going forward. But what happens if Android 15 ships behind schedule? Google would need to give the Pixel 9 series <em>eight</em> full OS upgrades to match the support it gave the Pixel 8. There&apos;s no way calling the jump from Android 14 to Android 15 a month or two after the Pixel 9 releases as "a full OS upgrade" will fly well with buyers.</p><p>Samsung might not be affected by this predicament if it gets its One UI 7 development in order. One UI 6 debuted in October 2023, roughly three months before the Galaxy S24 series debuted in January of this year. As long as Samsung manages to get its Android 15-based update ready before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineup launches, it could avoid chaos. It looks like Google might be in for a sticky situation, though.</p><p>For Google, the rumored choice to ship the Pixel 9 lineup with Android 14 is a big shift in strategy. The company&apos;s own Android phones have always been the standard for "stock Android," sometimes to a fault. But it&apos;s leaving that behind. Pixels are far from stock Android nowadays, since they&apos;re full of Pixel-exclusive features and now Google AI tools. Google is treating the Pixel brand like any other Android brand, and the culmination of that is breaking up the ties between new Android releases and new Pixel releases. </p><p>For Samsung, the delays to One UI 7 development appear to continue for a rough few weeks for the company&apos;s mobile and wearable teams. The company faced criticism for its new Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Buds 3 releases, which were not-so-subtly inspired by Apple products. More importantly, there are quality control issues, delayed release dates, and product availability concerns that are still being worked out. A significant delay to One UI 7 would be another black mark on Samsung&apos;s record. </p><p>Finally, the delays to both Android and Google&apos;s Android 15 updates underscore the feebleness of Android updates in general. We see missed targets and long waits for software upgrades in the Android world all too often. Recently, Motorola took a full year to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">give the Razr+ (2023) an Android 14 update</a>. For some, the lack of consistency in Android updates is just another thing pushing them to the iPhone.</p>

<p>It looks like OnePlus might be dropping its highly anticipated flagship earbuds as soon as this week.</p><p>Tipster Yogesh Brar spilled the beans on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3&apos;s unveiling. We’ve seen the specs from earlier leaks, but Brar hints that the launch might happen later this week.</p><p>As for the price, the latest tip suggests that OnePlus&apos; next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">flagship wireless earbuds</a> might hit the Indian market for Rs 13,999, though the final price is expected to be similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">Buds Pro 2</a>.</p>

<p>Brar didn’t mention any pricing information for the Western markets, but earlier leaks suggested the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 could be around €199 in Europe, or about $217 USD.

<p>The Buds Pro 3 might also have an impressive battery life of up to 43 hours.

<ul><li>Samsung is gearing up for its next device launch, probably in October.</li><li>The Galaxy S24 FE is fully leaked, revealing display and camera specs ahead of the anticipated launch.</li><li>The device will have a triple camera setup, look a lot like Galaxy S24, and will likely be powered by an Exynos 2400e chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Samsung&apos;s major Galaxy flagship launches wrapped up for the year, the next big thing to watch for is a Fan Edition. The rumored Galaxy S24 FE just got fully revealed, thanks to a new leak.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-specs-features">Android Headlines</a> obtained a bunch of renders for the Galaxy S24 FE&apos;s marketing materials, showing off the device, its colors, and most of the specs. At first glance, it looks similar to the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, featuring flat edges, rounded corners, and the familiar triple camera setup on the back. But this time, the colors seem to stand out as different in the renders.</p>

<p>The upcoming Fan Edition phone might come in shades of blue, black, silver, green, and yellow, giving users plenty of options to choose from. According to the marketing materials, the Galaxy S24 FE will feature an aluminum frame and an Infinity-O display, protected by Corning Gorilla Victus Plus on both the front and back.</p><p>The display is expected to be 6.7 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate and Full HD+ resolution. It could also reach a peak brightness of 1900 nits, with bezels as thin as 1.99mm.</p><p>The rear cameras might include a 50MP primary wide-angle shooter, a 12MP ultra wide-angle lens, and an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. On the front, there’s expected to be a 10MP sensor for selfies.</p><p>The battery capacity isn’t confirmed yet (though it’s rumored to be 4565mAh), but it’s expected to deliver 78 hours of listening time and up to 29 hours of video playback. Like the flagship Galaxy S24 series, the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, the Fan Edition will also feature Samsung&apos;s proprietary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p>
<p>The report also mentions that the Galaxy S24 FE will likely run on an Exynos 2400e processor, shipping with One UI 6.1.1, and featuring the Portrait Studio. In the U.S., its predecessor came with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, while other markets received the Exynos version. It seems likely that Samsung will follow a similar strategy this year.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-supplier-launch-reported">launch is expected</a> to be sometime around October, and the device will presumably compete with the higher <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range segment</a>, including models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. As for pricing, we expect it to be similar to the Galaxy S23 FE, which started at $599.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">reviewed the G8 Galileo</a> gaming controller earlier in the year, it was evident that GameSir was onto something special. The full-size controller just feels better to hold and use, and the hall effect thumbsticks and triggers are better than what&apos;s on console-grade controllers.</p><p>With the G8 Plus, GameSir is reusing the same design, but eschewing USB-C connectivity in favor of Bluetooth. In doing so, it is making the G8 Plus compatible with a significantly wider range of devices, including Android phones and tablets, iPhones, iPads, the Nintendo Switch, Windows, and just about anything that takes a Bluetooth controller.</p><p>That means you get the same great features as the G8 Galileo, but with the added convenience of Bluetooth. In short, if you&apos;re in need of a new mobile gaming controller, there really isn&apos;t anything better right now.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-pricing-and-availability"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<p>GameSir unveiled the G8 Plus mobile gaming controller on July 29, and it is now on sale globally. The G8 Plus is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">available for just $79 on Amazon</a>, and that&apos;s a bargain considering what you actually get. The regular G8 with USB-C connectivity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG">also costs the same</a>, and I&apos;d argue that the Bluetooth model is much more versatile.</p><p>You can also pick up the controller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/g8plus-bluetooth-mobile-controller">from the brand&apos;s own website</a>. Just like the standard edition, there isn&apos;t a carrying case bundled with the package — that&apos;s an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Controller-Bag/dp/B0CR15KD1W">additional $15</a> if you&apos;re buying the controller on Amazon.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-what-i-like"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HH3iJgika9kQfp2jYyuK7h" name="gamesir-g8-plus-2.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus next to the standard G8 Galileo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HH3iJgika9kQfp2jYyuK7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>GameSir nailed the design of the G8 Galileo, and it isn&apos;t changing anything with the G8 Plus. The controller has a full-size design, and there&apos;s a textured finish at the back that makes it easy to hold and use. The size is easily one of the best things about the G8 Plus; having full-size triggers, action buttons, and thumbsticks is just much more convenient, and the contoured design is comfortable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5F4ccgBitEpL5Yt7BTdZXi" name="gamesir-g8-plus-10.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus controller with Vivo X100 Ultra slotted in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5F4ccgBitEpL5Yt7BTdZXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another plus point is the customizability; the faceplates detach easily, and you can switch out the thumbsticks — two additional sizes are bundled in the package — and even the configuration of the X, Y, A, and B action buttons, ideal if you&apos;re pairing it with the Switch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rXtSLuLfyxe9HepV4HtnLi" name="gamesir-g8-plus-9.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus controller with Vivo X100 Ultra slotted in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rXtSLuLfyxe9HepV4HtnLi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The action buttons and D-Pad have good tactility, but it&apos;s the triggers and thumbsticks that differentiate the G8 Plus. GameSir uses hall effect magnetic sensors, and that means you&apos;ll never see any stick drift; while I&apos;ve only had the G8 Plus for a month, I used the G8 Galileo for the better part of a year now, and even after hundreds of hours of use, it has the same great feedback as day one.</p><p>The triggers have a great range of motion and excellent feedback, and the fact that you can change the size of the thumbsticks is an added bonus. There are two paddles at the back, and setting these up with in-game actions is relatively easy.</p>

<p>Coming in at 314g, the G8 Plus is 60g heavier than the G8 Galileo. The added weight is due to the 1000mAh internal battery, and thankfully, the heft is balanced on both sides (there&apos;s a 500mAh battery underneath each section). The added weight is noticeable, but it doesn&apos;t cause any fatigue even after extended gaming sessions.</p><p>While the G8 is available in a grey color scheme, the G8 Plus switches to a darker grey that looks a little better. You still get the same rubber bridge that ensures the controller doesn&apos;t damage your phone, and the left side has good enough extension that you can slot in tablets without a lot of hassle.</p>

<p>Cases aren&apos;t an issue either, and I was able to use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> with rather bulky cases attached. There&apos;s enough clearance available, and the phone is held snugly between the two halves. The matte texture of the G8 Plus doesn&apos;t attract smudges, and overall, there isn&apos;t anything to fault on the design side of things.</p>

<p>Getting started with the G8 Plus is about as straightforward as it gets; pairing over Bluetooth is seamless, and it maintained a rock-solid connection. The GameSir logo has an LED ring that changes color based on what device is connected to it; Android is yellow, iOS is blue, Switch is red, and so on. You can change modes by selecting the record button and one of the action buttons, and you can easily switch between devices.</p>

<p>In terms of day-to-day performance, there isn&apos;t a mobile gaming controller that is as good as the G8 Plus. The triggers and buttons have fantastic feedback, and I know I&apos;ve said this a few times by now, but the fact that you get full-size buttons makes all the difference. I used mobile controllers that are aimed at portability, and they&apos;re not as much fun to use — particularly during marathon gaming sessions. That isn&apos;t a problem with the G8 Plus.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-what-i-don-t-like"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZiDwadYyzkhLpJ7A9UgC6j" name="gamesir-g8-plus-13.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus doesn't fit phones with big cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiDwadYyzkhLpJ7A9UgC6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the G8 Plus retains the same design as the G8 Galileo, it shares the same drawbacks. If you have a phone with a large camera island, you can&apos;t slot it into the controller. I had issues with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>. The only phones that didn&apos;t have clearance issues were the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Pixel 8 Pro, so I ended up using the G8 Plus with these devices most of the time.</p>
<p>However, there is a workaround; as there&apos;s no need to connect over USB-C, I was able to slot in the X100 Ultra in a way that the camera island sits flush with the rubber back of the controller (instead of slotting into the extended section), and while it isn&apos;t as secure a fit, it is usable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pXCoEQBj4D5QafPh9QLmEj" name="gamesir-g8-plus-14.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus with USB-C connector highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pXCoEQBj4D5QafPh9QLmEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because the G8 Plus connects over Bluetooth, it misses out on two extras that I used extensively on the G8 Galileo: 3.5mm jack and passthrough charging. There is a USB-C port on the side of the controller, but that&apos;s to charge its internal battery.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-the-competition"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: The competition</span></h2>

<p>There&apos;s no shortage of mobile controllers, and the Backbone One continues to lead the pack. That said, if you want a controller with full-size buttons, I&apos;d recommend the G8 Galileo; it eschews Bluetooth in favor of USB-C, but you get passthrough charging and the convenience of a 3.5mm jack. At $79, it costs the same as the G8 Plus.</p><p>Scuf&apos;s Nomad is a good choice if you want a smaller controller that has high-quality triggers and buttons. It isn&apos;t as comfortable to hold and use as the G8 Plus, but it&apos;s easier to carry on the road, and it has Bluetooth connectivity.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a mobile controller with Bluetooth</li><li>You need full-size triggers and buttons</li><li>You want excellent battery life</li><li>You need hall effect thumbsticks</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have a phone with sizeable cameras</li><li>You need a controller with a 3.5mm jack and passthrough charging</li></ul>
<p>GameSir didn&apos;t make any design modifications to the G8 Plus, and that&apos;s a good thing. The G8 Galileo is arguably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">best Android game controller</a> around, and a big part of its allure is the size; the ability to use full-size triggers, thumbsticks, action buttons, and D-Pad on a mobile gaming controller is wonderful, and it is the main reason why I like the G8 so much.</p><p>The G8 Plus follows in the same vein, and Bluetooth integration makes it easier to use. There&apos;s absolutely no lag or delay when using the controller, and the triggers are among the best you&apos;ll find in this segment. It is heavier than the standard G8, but the added heft isn&apos;t too noticeable, and battery life has been terrific.</p><p>To sum up, there isn&apos;t much to fault with the G8 Plus, and if you need a mobile gaming controller that connects over Bluetooth, it&apos;s my go-to recommendation.</p>

<p>Smart rings have the potential to beat smartwatches when it comes to step-counting accuracy. We tested the most popular smart rings today, and three of them outperformed our favorite smartwatches for exact step counts. Unfortunately, smart rings have a problem with <em>phantom</em> steps that must be fixed before we can fully recommend them.</p><p>Smart rings aren&apos;t built for fitness tracking the way smartwatches are. They can&apos;t sample your heart rate as often because of smaller battery capacity, they become less accurate when your fingers swell from faster blood flow, and you have no screen to check your progress. In particular, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> has underwhelmed us with its paltry fitness features.</p><p>So, imagine my surprise when I asked our reviewer to do a Galaxy Ring step test, and it measured only 11 extra steps after taking 5,000 steps—significantly better than his Pixel Watch 2 (192 extra). I&apos;ve done several smartwatch step tests in the last year, and only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> have come close to that accuracy level.</p><p>When comparing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-key-differences">smart rings vs. smartwatches</a>, we generally trust the former for sleep tracking and health data and the latter for workouts. But getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">10,000 steps a day</a> is more of a mainstream health issue than a true "workout," and it&apos;d be great if smart rings excelled at this casual metric.</p><p>Since I only own one smart ring, I enlisted our phones editor, Nick Sutrich, and our managing editor, Derrek Lee, to perform step tests to see whether smart rings can beat smartwatches for step counting across brands. Here&apos;s how each device did:</p>

<p>I never thought of smart rings as particularly reliable for step counting because my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> undercounts them. Things balance out because it&apos;ll count false steps while I&apos;m at home, but I found most smartwatches to be better, and I&apos;ve seen plenty of complaints on the r/Ultrahuman subreddit that back me up.</p><p>Competing smart ring brands have their step-count algorithms a bit more fine-tuned! The Samsung Galaxy Ring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, and Amazfit Helio Ring all came within 12 steps of the actual walking total. The RingConn Smart Ring Gen 2 was ridiculously off after Lee&apos;s first test but did more respectably in its second test, better than some popular smartwatches.</p>

<p>For comparison, most smartwatches tend to fall into the good-but-not-great range. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">cheap fitness watch accuracy test</a> this March, the Forerunner 165 (+11 steps after 5,000) did excellently, while the Coros Pace 3 (+84) and Fitbit Charge 6 (-199) weren&apos;t quite as reliable. </p><p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">first step-counting test</a> last year, Amazfit (+46), Apple (-60), and Samsung (+74) fell into that same adequate range, with my Fitbit (-286) pretty horrendous and Garmin (+14) winning.</p><p>That&apos;s why my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> surprised me by doing so well in this walking test, matching my Garmin Forerunner 965. No non-Garmin smartwatch has fallen within a ±30-step range across a half-dozen step tests, until now. Maybe some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> devs have started to fine-tune their step algorithms, too! </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6ZbxiTFz2AU8sEwWMHvK8k" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-03.jpg" alt="Holding the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ZbxiTFz2AU8sEwWMHvK8k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But returning to the main point, I&apos;m impressed with how well smart rings do for step counting in normal walking conditions. A few standout watches aside, <em>most</em> of them miscount by at least 100 steps after a couple of miles.</p><p>It&apos;s much harder to track steps while running—try keeping count when you&apos;re stepping twice as fast and out of breath—but Sutrich said his Galaxy Ring step count seemed much more realistic than his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> count after a 5K spartan race (even though the PW2 was <em>much</em> better at heart rate).</p><p>So, what&apos;s the "major flaw" I hinted at in the headline? Simple: smart rings across brands will track hundreds or <em>thousands</em> of steps when you&apos;re at home or in the office. </p><p>Typing an email? Take some steps. Gesticulating excitedly during a conversation? Have some more steps! Cooking dinner? Your smartwatch will add maybe 50 steps as you move around the kitchen; your smart ring could add 2–10X that. You get some extra steps, and you get some extra steps, and <em>you</em> get some extra steps!</p><p>Sutrich&apos;s Galaxy Ring did near-perfectly while walking, but he&apos;d managed to hit 3,675 steps <em>before</em> the test, and he confirmed he hadn&apos;t done anything active that day. That&apos;s the equivalent of nearly two miles of walking around the house and yard, and it&apos;s unlikely he was anywhere close to that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9szTm994H89RsmcghQJdo" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-vs-Oura-Ring-Gen-3-2.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring and Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9szTm994H89RsmcghQJdo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A couple of Android Central team members own Oura Rings, and they were the first to warn me about the false-step issue, adding thousands of phantom steps daily while they&apos;re at home working on articles or playing with pets.</p><p>Smartwatches don&apos;t have this issue to the same extent. Some brands have the occasional false step or fulfill <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">stand alerts</a> when they shouldn&apos;t, but you won&apos;t see thousands of steps unless you&apos;re truly walking or working out.</p><p>If smart ring makers can tweak their accelerometer data to detect the difference between incidental movement and true steps, then that&apos;ll be the final step (pun intended) in making rings more useful for casual fitness tracking. That&apos;s a big if: Oura&apos;s had years to improve in this area. </p><p>But the fact that multiple smart ring brands have already cracked the step-tracking code in normal conditions, beating out decade-old smartwatch brands, gives me hope that they&apos;ll improve at seeing through non-step movement in the near future.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Orico is best known for its HDD and SSD enclosures, and the Chinese manufacturer has been at it for over 15 years. The brand has recently ventured into Thunderbolt 4 docking stations, storage servers, and SSDs, and I&apos;m kickstarting coverage with the Mecha O20, a rugged external SSD that&apos;s aiming to go up against the likes of the Crucial X10 Pro and Samsung T9.</p><p>The Mecha O20 is available in 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB storage variants, and the 2TB model I&apos;m using is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Portable-External-Resistance-Professionals/dp/B0CQLDRCQX">available for $167 on Amazon</a>, an enticing 30% discount on its $239 retail price. The discount makes it a much better value than its rivals, and having used the Mecha O20 for the better part of a month, I can confidently say that it holds up against the best that this segment has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VpgzQuS3LuNjxRG9SBHByB" name="orico-mecha-o20-3.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD in-hand view showing size" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VpgzQuS3LuNjxRG9SBHByB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is a key talking point of the Mecha O20, so let&apos;s start there. While most external SSDs have an enclosure that&apos;s weather-resistant and tumble-proof, Orico is taking things to a whole new level. The chassis of the Mecha O20 is made out of an aluminum alloy, and it is durable in its own right. But what&apos;s interesting is that Orico added silicon casing to the chassis, and that allows it to withstand the elements much better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GdmRLi5ehEsNfynMwCDBNC" name="orico-mecha-o20-5.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD USB-C covered" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdmRLi5ehEsNfynMwCDBNC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part is that the USB-C port is also covered by a silicone plug, and you&apos;ll need to lift the flap to get to the connector. The only issue with this is that because the port is recessed, you can&apos;t use all USB-C cables; the usual Acefast cables I use have a larger USB connector, and they were too big; this is the same problem as having a bulky phone case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4xDtUyzBhW5jd4WiuDrmB" name="orico-mecha-o20-2.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD with USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4xDtUyzBhW5jd4WiuDrmB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, Orico includes a 20Gbps cable with the package, and it has a 2-in-1 connector that doubles as USB-A or USB-C based on target device. I plugged the SSD into several Android phones, Windows machine, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, and it worked straight out the bat — no need to configure anything. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ByNf5YKXwGGqviBtWqvxAC" name="orico-mecha-o20-4.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD next to other external SSDs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ByNf5YKXwGGqviBtWqvxAC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis and added silicone casing makes the Mecha O20 bulkier than most external SSDs, but it isn&apos;t so big that it affects portability — you can still carry it around in a bag with ease. At 189g, it isn&apos;t heavy either, and the grey color scheme is understated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oXxvVKCHtdVdDv7kzdz6iC" name="orico-mecha-o20-7.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD side view showing silicone casing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXxvVKCHtdVdDv7kzdz6iC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a hanging loop to one side, and if you&apos;re so inclined, you can attach the SSD to the outside of your bag — it is resistant to rain, tumbles, and dirt. The SSD comes with an IP54 rating, so while it isn&apos;t advisable to dunk it in water, it holds up incredibly well in any other scenario.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MwGZ5cEh3z3Bwy8kNWTy5D" name="orico-mecha-o20-9.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD next to Vivo X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MwGZ5cEh3z3Bwy8kNWTy5D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Mecha O20 uses a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, and that means you get a 20Gbps bandwidth, with reads going up to 2,000MB/s. There aren&apos;t many devices that use the Gen 2x2 interface, and in that scenario, it switches to the 10Gbps USB standard. In my usage, I saw reads going up to 1,829MB/s and writes of 1,634MB/s, and that&apos;s among the highest of any external SSD I tested.</p>
<p>Random read/writes hovered at the 200MB/s figure, and again, that&apos;s a great showing by the SSD. I didn&apos;t see any issues transferring thousands of photos and videos from the Vivo X100 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro, and the moving hundreds of gigabytes of data from Windows. In this regard, it has proven to be just as reliable as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-drive-your-chromebox">best external SSDs</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4qd4VptqPxBS5957Nmo5ZC" name="orico-mecha-o20-6.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qd4VptqPxBS5957Nmo5ZC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a result, I have no qualms recommending the Mecha O20. I have a dozen external SSDs, and the Mecha O20 easily has the most rugged design. Thanks to the Gen 2x2 interface, it is among the fastest SSDs around as well, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in daily use. If you&apos;re in need of an external SSD and want something that doesn&apos;t cost as much as Samsung, the Mecha O20 is the one to get.</p>

In a lot of ways, it&apos;s another average mid-range phone but there are some great standout features. I was excited to see them all, but what <em>really</em> caught my eye is what HMD calls "HMD Gen 2 repairability."</p><p>This weekly column is where my bosses kind of let me be me, and you usually won&apos;t see me talk about a phone or give my own type of review here. This week is going to be different because this phone is worth talking about.</p>

<p>The Skyline seems like an average budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">Android phone under $400</a> with some standout features in the camera department. It is, and that&apos;s what a lot of people will think about it.</p><p>It does have one other feature that you won&apos;t find in any other phones: "HMD Gen 2 repairability." I&apos;ll talk a bit more about what that means later down the page, but I&apos;ll give you a teaser: I love it. It&apos;s a standout feature that belongs on every phone we buy, regardless of price.</p>
<h2 id="design-and-specs-2">Design and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gi2Fk6VXsqzEAL7T3FY5pY" name="HMD-Skyline-2.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gi2Fk6VXsqzEAL7T3FY5pY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you pick up the Skyline, you will think about the Nokia smartphones of the past. It&apos;s a cross between the old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9">Nokia N9</a> and Lumia phones that ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com">Windows Phone</a>, built with a solid metal body and a plastic back. Yes, plastic — Nokia-style "good" plastic. There&apos;s nothing to complain about unless you don&apos;t dig the sharp corners of the metal frame.</p><p>The fit and finish on my unit are awesome, and I&apos;m serious when I say it reminds me of the N9 (a phone I loved) when I&apos;m holding it. Other people say it reminds them of a premium Lumia model, and I can see it. What I&apos;m saying here is that this phone gives a feeling of quality.</p>
<p>A few things stand out, namely the side-mounted fingerprint/power button and a standalone custom button that can be programmed to open your favorite apps or perform phone functions.</p><p>The side-mounted fingerprint sensor is one of those things you will either love or hate. It&apos;s fast; pressing it reads your fingerprint and unlocks the phone in one motion. Of course, it acts as a security feature in apps that can use a fingerprint sensor. I love this design and prefer it over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/business-front-why-i-never-want-rear-fingerprint-sensor-ever-again">in-screen systems</a> because it&apos;s faster and more accurate, and the power button is how I turn my phone screen on. If you are someone who taps the screen and then uses the sensor, you might not care for it.</p>

<p>So, the Skyline is not one of those powerhouse phones that people love to talk about. Its specs are powerful enough to serve the intended purpose, but it won&apos;t match <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the latest superphone</a> with the latest chip when it comes to raw power.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not going to work well. I&apos;ve found no problems with the phone slowing down during the time I&apos;ve been using it, including playing games, surfing the web, and watching videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.98%;"><img id="iRniscpcSBSHWVRdY7e5S5" name="Skyline-software.png" alt="HMD Skyline software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRniscpcSBSHWVRdY7e5S5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2397" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display is good; the colors look fine, the viewing angle is good, and it has a great way of handling screen refresh. There are four modes: Standard (60Hz only), 120Hz, 144Hz, and Auto. 120 and 144Hz lock your refresh rates to those numbers, and Auto will scale between 60 and 120Hz depending on whether you&apos;re acting with the screen (it ramps up) or playing a full-screen video. If you want to use power and have a 144Hz refresh display, you certainly can, but I found the auto setting to work well.</p><p>The screen isn&apos;t exceptionally bright, and that becomes apparent outside in the sun. It&apos;s bright enough, but just barely.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n3CVznVANEF2nV3JT7FPC9" name="HMD-Skyline-Qi2-1.jpg" alt="Qi2 charger coil" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3CVznVANEF2nV3JT7FPC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I purposely didn&apos;t gauge battery life, and I can&apos;t judge network performance because this is not a phone built for North America (at least, not the model I have). Battery life in a phone is very dependent on your network signal strength, so there is no way for me to accurately judge how well the Skyline does. On Airplane mode with Wi-Fi enabled, it lasts about 10.5 hours of non-stop streaming video before it complains that the battery is low.</p><p>The charging speed is average, but I saw no issues. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins" target="_blank">Qi2 wireless charging</a> also works with a standard Qi charger once you align the coils, but it will not charge at the Qi2 15W rated speed when used this way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2150px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.12%;"><img id="stwaAdST4Ez3qRKxogGSXA" name="Skyline-camera-features.png" alt="HMD Skyline camera features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/stwaAdST4Ez3qRKxogGSXA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2150" height="2389" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera system takes fine photos, but nothing wowed me. The highlights are the 50MP lens with optical zoom, a front-facing camera with true auto-focus, and HMD&apos;s software additions that use AI to deliver good night photos or gesture controls for the selfie camera.</p><p>I found the optical zoom also delivers decent macro shots if you provide plenty of light, with the camera AI turning out close-up photos better than I expected.</p><p>You will take great photos with the Skyline. You&apos;ll also take mediocre photos. The same can be said for most phones.</p>

<p>If you read all this and think the Skyline is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">solid "budget" phone</a> (it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/hmd-skyline?sku=HQ50200045X70">starts at just $499</a> for the 8GB/128GB model), you are absolutely right. A lot of people are looking for a phone like the Skyline, and its excellent design pushes it to the top of the budget phone heap if it is available where you live. You should take a close look at it. But it has one more trick up its sleeve, and that&apos;s <strong>real</strong> user serviceability.</p>
<h2 id="user-serviceability-is-a-cinch-2">User-serviceability is a cinch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD" name="HMD-Skyline-3.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is what makes the Skyline great to me. In fact, it makes me question why other phones that sell for hundreds more don&apos;t offer something similar. I&apos;m <strong>not</strong> saying the Skyline is great when it comes to sustainability because you&apos;ll only see two years of software updates, and that&apos;s a shame, especially because you&apos;ll easily be able to keep this phone going longer than two years.</p><p>The Skyline doesn&apos;t have a battery you can swap out when it gets low and I think those days are gone. It does have the next best thing — a battery that&apos;s simple to replace once it reaches the end of its useful life while still keeping the phone water resistant. </p>
<p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone 5</a> are simple to repair if you know what you&apos;re doing and can offer great multi-year software support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">I love them</a>. But the Skyline is the phone <strong>you</strong> can repair at home on your kitchen table.</p><p>With a T3 Torx screwdriver and a few guitar picks you can open the phone up to replace the battery, the charging board, the display, and the speaker using parts you will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/HMD_Skyline">find at iFixIt</a>. You won&apos;t need heat guns and special tools to crack things open and once inside things are laid out to make replacements easy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VvyPTykDqE9reWkY2MBvZ" name="HMD-Skyline-6.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VvyPTykDqE9reWkY2MBvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A small cam is in the bottom corner of the phone, and turning it lifts the corner of the phone&apos;s rear cover. Once you&apos;ve done that, use something like a guitar pick or a plastic spudger to go around the back cover and release the clips that hold it on.</p><p>From there, it&apos;s easy to unplug cables, replace a battery or charging board, or get to other screws that hold the display to the main board. This sounds harder than it is, and anyone with steady hands who can follow a simple guide can do all of this themselves. If you&apos;re not the type who wants to do this, easy repairability also means it should cost a lot less to have a shop fix your phone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Once the HMD Skyline is opened up, fiddling around and replacing parts is incredibly easy, and that's very important on a phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I can&apos;t stress how important this is enough. All of us have had a phone that seems to not hold a charge very long or one where we&apos;ve broken the screen. At that point, you usually don&apos;t even think about fixing it yourself because the phone wasn&apos;t designed to be easy to fix. The Skyline was designed that way, and it is still rated IP54 water resistant. You can&apos;t take underwater photos with your Skyline, but it can survive a spilled drink (or maybe even an accidental dunk, but don&apos;t count on it).  </p><p>And it still has a back that comes off so you can get to the parts without being an electronics tech with a box full of specialty tools. More importantly, everything goes back together just as easily.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="msuGKrYYY8t6DsKYWNncWg" name="HMD-Skyline-4.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/msuGKrYYY8t6DsKYWNncWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="i-want-to-recommend-this-but-2">I want to recommend this, but...</h2>
<p>Since this is my version of a review, I&apos;m going to tell it to you straight. You should buy this phone if:</p>
<ul><li>You want a cheap phone with a good camera.</li><li>You're OK with two years of software support.</li><li>You want a phone you can fix yourself if you break the screen or need a new battery.</li></ul>
<p>You shouldn&apos;t buy this phone if:</p>
<ul><li>You need a support window longer than two years.</li><li>You want a phone with the best specs.</li><li>You spend all day outside in the brightest sun.</li></ul>
<p>I take issue with HMD&apos;s support schedule, especially for a phone where I can change the battery every few years. I also know a lot of people won&apos;t care and buy a new phone every couple of years anyway. There has been talk about HMD offering support for bootloader unlocking, and that would be enough to put me squarely in the "would buy" camp. Until then, <em>I</em> would pass, even though I think the repairability of this phone makes it special.</p><p>Regardless, if you&apos;re in North America, don&apos;t buy the Skyline unless HMD releases a localized version. HMD is not selling this phone here because it hasn&apos;t been designed yet to work here. Hopefully, the reports of HMD releasing the Skyline for the U.S. and Canada in the future will come to fruition, and then you can make that decision for yourself.</p>
