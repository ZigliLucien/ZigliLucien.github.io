                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Wallet previously allowed users to make contactless payments in small amounts without unlocking their device, though the exact terms varied by region.</li><li>Last month, Google added a disclaimer to a related support article that warned users that their payment wouldn't go through unless they had recently unlocked their device.</li><li>Now, this change is rolling out in Europe, and users took to social media to share their frustration with this change. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a change to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> that will make using contactless payments for small transactions more secure but also more frustrating. Google Wallet works in different ways based on a user&apos;s region, and in Europe, it previously allowed users to pay in small amounts without unlocking their devices. The threshold varied by country, and in some places like the U.S., all transactions required a device unlock. Now, Google is making device unlocks a requirement for all users in all reasons, and not everyone is happy about the change. </p><p>The company updated a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519#zippy=%2Cpayment-limits-on-a-locked-device" target="_blank">support document</a> last month related to tap-to-pay transactions, previewing the shift in Google Wallet behavior (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/google-wallet-unlock/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). </p><p>"Coming soon, your credit and debit card won&apos;t be charged for retail payments unless you&apos;ve recently used a verification method, like your fingerprint or PIN," the notice reads. "Some users may already need to verify to make a payment. If you’re asked to verify it’s you, complete verification steps on your device to make a payment."</p><p>U.S. users won&apos;t notice a change because device unlocks were already necessary for all transactions other than those using express transit. However, users in other countries could make transactions under a given threshold without unlocking in Google Wallet. For example, people in Canada could make payments under $100 CAD without unlocking their devices. In the U.K., that limit is around £45 GBP.</p><p>However, people in regions where device unlocks were not always required are finding they now need to authenticate each contactless payment in Google Wallet, no matter the transaction size. The only exception is if a user has recently used a verification method. So, if you authenticated Google Wallet a minute ago and haven&apos;t locked your device, you won&apos;t need to unlock it again. </p><p>Though this change makes Google Wallet objectively more secure, not everyone is happy about it. A few users on Reddit criticized the shift, and others called it a non-issue. One thing many seem to agree on is that Google should have left the choice up to the end user whether to require device unlocks for every transaction. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s choice to require verification for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">Google Wallet payments</a> of all denominations has brought up an age-old debate in cybersecurity: do you want convenience or security? Users on social media disagree, but in this case, Google has made the decision for them. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>With the second Android 15 Developer Preview, users can choose between a pinned or hidden taskbar on large-screened Pixel devices. </li><li>The option marks the return of the Android 12L-style taskbar, which was present at the bottom of the screen all the time. </li><li>Now, Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet users can employ a persistent taskbar for multitasking or a hidden taskbar for extra screen real estate. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google sent out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second Android 15 Developer Preview</a> this past week, and it includes a change that&apos;ll benefit owners of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a> or Pixel Tablet.</p><p>Now that the company makes a few big-screened devices, Google has been swiftly optimizing Android for larger displays. Part of that effort included adding the taskbar as a way to quickly launch apps and multitask from anywhere in Android, and starting with Android 15 DP2, users have the choice of having a pinned or floating taskbar. </p><p>Since it was introduced a few years ago, the taskbar has evolved quite a bit. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12l-how-google-fixes-android-foldables-and-large-screens">Android 12L</a>, it was a permanent fixture at the bottom of large Android devices. It remained on the screen while users opened up other apps, thus cutting into the total screen space available. That&apos;s why Google reversed course in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, transitioning the taskbar into a floating oval that could be shown or hidden as needed. However, there was never a way to choose between these taskbar variants. </p><p>That is, until now. Android expert Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-taskbar-pinning-3427938/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> first noticed the option to choose between taskbar styles in Android 15 DP2. After tapping and holding on an open space in the taskbar, a new <strong>Always show taskbar </strong>toggle will appear. There&apos;s a toggle beside it, and tapping the toggle will transition the windowed taskbar into the pinned taskbar.</p><p>While the Android 15 DP2 version of the floating taskbar is visually updated with the new Android design language, it&apos;s more or less functionally identical to the old version. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 15 DP2 finally adds the "taskbar pinning" feature I first spotted backed in Android 14 Beta 3!This feature lets Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet users revert back to the old, persistent taskbar style introduced in Android 12L.More details 👇https://t.co/Upo1d7tQ5z<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1771225394185699757">March 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>There are clear benefits to going with each taskbar version. The pinned taskbar option makes it easier to call up new apps, create multitasking views, and switch between active apps. On the other hand, the floating taskbar gives you more screen space to fill up with Android apps. The good thing about the Android 15 DP2 change is that Pixel Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> users now have the option of choosing the taskbar version they prefer best.</p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) will be launching in Mint color next to Pink and Black colorways.</li><li>It will likely opt for the Exynos 1280 for the first time, switching away from the Qualcomm chipset.</li><li>The tablet has been spotted in BIS certification, indicating two variants in the pipeline.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is the next mid-range tablet that will likely launch soon, and while we have already seen early renders of the device, a new leak spills some more information on the upcoming tablet.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite was first introduced in 2020, and its next iteration launched in 2022. Two years later, its successor may see the light of day, and a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-mint-colour-images/">91mobiles</a> reveals that it will sport a new Mint color for the first time. </p><p>91mobiles indicates that these images were spotted in some official listings showcasing the device in full, including its features and specs. The upcoming tablet will likely have the same design as its predecessor, and alongside the new Mint color, it will also have pink and black colorways during the launch. The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) was seen in Pink in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-leak">leaked renders</a> early this month.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.36%;"><img id="Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-render-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1146" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside the design, the rest of the specs are likely pretty similar to those of its predecessor. It includes a 10.4-inch screen with 2000 x 1200 resolution accompanied by sizable bezels. The optics setup will again likely comprise a single 8MP sensor on the rear and a 5MP selfie shooter on the front. The rear camera would presumably support 1080p video recording.</p><p>The prominent aspect of the predecessor is its battery capacity, and the Tab S6 Lite (2024) is also expected to sport a massive 7,040mAh battery with 14-hour video playback. The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">mid-range tablet</a> also supports the S-Pen, which attaches to the right pane of the device and matches the corresponding color of the tablet.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting change from the previous iteration is the chipset powering the tablet. It is expected to ship with an Exynos 1280 SoC, which powers some Galaxy phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review">Galaxy A53 5G</a>. The same chipset was mentioned in the previous leak, which showcased the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) renders. </p>

<p>For storage, the upcoming Galaxy Tab S6 would feature at least 4GB of RAM aided by either 64GB or 128GB of onboard storage, and microSD support is expected for additional storage. 91mobiles further notes that the device will ship One UI 6.1 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>) out of the box. Additional highlights of the device include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.3, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and AKG-powered speakers.</p><p>The device recently went through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-bis-india-launch/">BIS certification</a> bearing <strong>SM-P620</strong> and <strong>SM-P625</strong> model numbers, which indicate that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) would be available in Wi-Fi and LTE variants. It also seems to have appeared in the U.S. FCC and Denmark&apos;s UL database — all pointing out to an imminent launch starting with India.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> is $200 off for the Amazon Big Spring Sale, cutting nearly a third off the cost to bring it to its lowest price ever. With its vibrant 6.2-inch AMOLED display, 128GB of storage, and the powerful Google Tensor G3 chipset, this <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is a great pick—especially at this price point.</p>
<p>While this phone's upgrade configuration, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, offers some of the best cameras on the market, the more affordable Pixel 8 also takes great pictures and videos and offers both rear and front wide-angle lenses.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a phone that tooks high-quality photos and videos; you prefer a smartphone with several Android OS updates; you like the Pixel design language, both in UI and in physical aesthetic.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want your phone to come with a charger out of the box; </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 is a great small phone with the beautiful aesthetics and performance that have become associated with the Pixel series. Its 6.2-inch AMOLED display doesn&apos;t hinder it from being a great phone for one-hand users, as Google designed it to be about 5.1mm shorter and 2.4mm narrower than the last-generation Pixel 7. The screen offers a refresh rate of 120Hz, and while the Google Tensor G3 chipset isn&apos;t the fastest processor out there, it still features smooth performance with a beautiful, user-friendly UI design.</p><p>This configuration comes with 128GB of storage, though you can also upgrade to 256GB. It also offers three powerful cameras, including both rear- and front-facing  wide-angle lenses, and seven years of Android OS updates—the most you can get with an Android phone.</p>

Apple and Google could be working together. </p><p>According to a recent Bloomberg report, Apple is currently in talks with Google as it looks at bringing Gemini&apos;s AI models to the iPhone. Some sources say that Gemini&apos;s array would be integrated into Apple&apos;s generative AI features that are being developed for the iPhone. These new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Gemini-backed</a> capabilities will reportedly be available on Apple&apos;s iOS 18, which will be released later this year. </p><p>iPhones could get AI-based image creation, and the update could enable features like "writing essays based on simple prompts." Apple has reportedly been testing its own Learning Language Model in the past year, such as its own AI chatbot called "Apple GPT." However, it looks like the company is leaning towards Google&apos;s &apos;more superior&apos; AI model.</p><p>Apple&apos;s CEO Tim Cook said he is looking at implementing Apple&apos;s version of AI features onto the iPhone on a "very thoughtful basis."</p>

This means that Google now has the fourth-largest market share in the country. </p><p>Google unlocked handset sales are on the rise and account for 9% of total sales. However, to keep up with Samsung (20%) and Apple (19%), Google has a long way to go. According to Anthony Scarsella, Research Director at IDC, "Apple and Samsung continue strengthening their hold on the US smartphone market, with the two vendors combining for 74.2 percent of the market. This represents an all-time high market share for the two vendors."</p>

On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, Google introduced a feature that allowed your phone to recognize multiple languages for audio and switch between them automatically; with Android 15, it wants to improvise on this feature and give apps the opportunity to run this seamlessly.</p><p>This update focuses on ensuring apps run smoothly rather than adding new features. Google has also been working on tightening up privacy, security, and the overall user experience. This developer preview of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is mainly for app makers preparing for the next big Android release, which will probably drop in the fall. </p>

Along with 16 other district attorneys, the DOJ is targeting the tech giant for its "anti-competitive practices." </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/9765671b79f64ad9/6cfe3c6c-full.pdf">antitrust lawsuit</a> claims that Apple takes advantage of its dominant ecosystem and monopoly power to extract more money from consumers, developers, and others. The lawsuit targets Apple&apos;s most-priced possessions, the iPhone and the Apple Watch, as well as messaging, how the company handles cloud streaming games, and more.</p><p>The DOJ says that the company has always known that this kind of dominance has been threatened by other factors, such as innovative products and apps. And instead of responding to these competitive threats by lowering the prices of its products for consumers, Apple has always wriggled its way out by imposing a series of "shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines."</p><p>The complaint talks about how Apple has blocked cross-platform messaging, the compatibility of its devices with Android phones, and the restriction of developers from creating apps that would bring about advancements in technology, among others. They accuse Apple of knowingly bringing about strategies to make customers reliant on their products. </p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107784/apples-response-to-the-dojs-iphone-antitrust-lawsuit">The Verge</a>, Apple responded to the lawsuit, stating that it threatened its identity and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-user-discovers-debris-inside-hinge"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Some Galaxy Z Fold users have been reporting a peculiar issue—their phones aren&apos;t unfolding all the way. However, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1bfrnpi/managed_to_open_fold_4_flat_evidence_against/">Reddit user</a> has managed to uncover the reason behind this. He believes that debris finds its way into the moving part of the hinge. To solve the problem, all he had to do was dismantle the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and remove debris from the hinge by hand.</p><p>In the post, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 user described having an increasingly difficult time opening their smartphone completely flat. After failed attempts to get Samsung to repair or replace the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, he decided to take apart the device, revealing a collection of lint, thread, and other debris trapped inside the hinge that prevented it from opening. After putting the device back together, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 was able to open completely flat again. </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1bfrnpi/managed_to_open_fold_4_flat_evidence_against">Managed to Open Fold 4 Flat - Evidence Against Samsung's Warranty Denial</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold">r/GalaxyFold</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This could hint at a bigger problem that tech companies should address while making foldables. Dust, debris, and other small particles could impact the overall performance of the device. The issue of folding phones not opening flat became an important topic around the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a>, which some claim is not able to unfold flat. One of our units at Android Central seems to be limited to 178-179 degrees rather than the full 180 degrees.</p>

<p>It&apos;s important to note that this is only a U.S. thing and has nothing to do with Apple&apos;s business elsewhere. Just as we saw when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eu-finds-apple-guilty-abusing-its-dominant-market-position-spotify-antitrust-case">EU went after Apple</a> and changes were made that only affected products sold in the EU, any results in this trial only affect business done in the U.S.</p>
<p>Having said that, the complaint against Apple claims that the company:</p>
<ul><li>Degrades and undermines cross-platform messaging apps and rival smartphones, including introducing deliberate incompatibilities to prevent Android users from seamlessly sending messages to iPhone users.</li><li>Makes it difficult for U.S. app developers to list "Super Apps," which have a broad array of functions and make it easier for consumers to switch from one phone manufacturer to another </li><li>Blocks cloud gaming services on iPhones by historically refusing to list cloud gaming apps on the Apple App Store. Cloud gaming allows consumers to stream and play video games seamlessly across different devices independent of phone hardware.  </li><li>Limits basic functionality when consumers try to use third-party cross-platform smartwatches with iPhones.</li><li>Restricts digital wallet competitors by allowing only Apple Wallet access to the iPhone's "tap-to-pay" functionality.</li></ul>

<p>Much of this list sounds like it comes straight from an angry user on the Android subreddit, and as a result, people are tripping over themselves to rush to Apple&apos;s defense. However, it&apos;s important to know a few things about the word "monopoly" in this context though, because it&apos;s not what you think.</p><p>The DOJ addresses this in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQQUCm7lcl0">a press conference</a>. The Supreme Court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/atr/monopoly-power-and-market-power-antitrust-law#:~:text=&apos;%20%5BFN34%5D%20By%20contrast%2C,control%20prices%20or%20exclude%20competition.">defines monopoly power</a> as "the power to control prices or exclude competition." As stated in the complaint, Apple has that power in the smartphone market. The DOJ states that while having monopoly power doesn&apos;t necessarily violate antitrust laws by itself, it does "when a firm acquires or maintains a monopoly not because it has a superior product or superior business acumen, but by engaging in exclusionary conduct." </p><p>The Justice Department claims Apple has done just that, just as it claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-justice-department-google-antitrust">Google abused its monopoly power</a> in search. Therefore, the Justice Department must prosecute.</p>
<p>Forget about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ios-17-android-group-chat-workaround">green bubbles</a> and the price of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a> for a moment. A company that can use its influence to stifle competition instead of simply providing a better product is bad for business. It&apos;s bad when Google does it. It&apos;s bad when Amazon does it. It&apos;s equally bad when Apple does it. Even a hint of illegal behavior should be investigated and, if necessary, litigated.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VSGsmjDpiESgUi2DdCH42B" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-review-hero-16-9.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 Plus on a corner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VSGsmjDpiESgUi2DdCH42B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn&apos;t about Google or Android or any other company. It&apos;s about Apple. </p><p>It almost feels like it is, though. It is important to remember the DOJ isn&apos;t doing this so that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-the-real-reason-imessage-isnt-available-android">iMessage can work on Android</a> or so iPhone users can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>. It just so happens that Android is the only competition in these spaces, so a "level playing field" in the U.S. smartphone market means Samsung, Google, and Motorola benefit.</p><p>The DOJ has the Herculean task of holding all tech companies to a set of standards, so we see Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and now Apple at odds over antitrust laws. Whether you think it does a good job at keeping a level playing field makes no difference — it has to try and enforce existing laws and help shape new ones. </p>
<p>Sometimes, that means a company you like ends up in court; sometimes, it&apos;s the company you don&apos;t like. But both times, you benefit.</p><p>If the Justice Department has its way (doubtful) Apple would be forced to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">better integrate iMessage with accepted standards</a>, more work would be done to use third-party smartwatches on the platform, and there would be fewer obstacles when moving from iOS to Android. None of those things may happen; it is still a win for consumers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6" name="pixel-watch-2-final-review-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 while charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No single company should have an insurmountable advantage in the consumer market unless it&apos;s because the products it sells are better in every way, and even then, it should not be able to leverage this to drive competition out of business. And no, your anecdotal evidence doesn&apos;t count; just because you like a thing doesn&apos;t mean everyone does.</p><p>Great artists steal. You&apos;ve heard that before, and whether you want to admit it or not, it&apos;s true. Smartphone software is the epitome of this statement — Samsung, Google, and Apple have been lifting ideas for years, and in the end, we are the beneficiaries. Do you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">enjoy using your phone</a>? If so, thank Palm and BlackBerry.</p><p>If one company is allowed to kill off competition by abusing its position in the market, we are the ones who suffer. Apple isn&apos;t going to thank BlackBerry for iMessage, and Google isn&apos;t going to thank its hardware partners for 50% of Android&apos;s features, but we would not be here without them.</p><p>Being able to kill off your business rivals is against the law for our benefit, and we should welcome seeing investigations like this, even when it&apos;s the company you like.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp is potentially working on generative AI image-editing features teased since September.</li><li>These AI-powered editing tools, including Backdrop, Restyle, and Expand, are expected to allow users to enhance their images conveniently.</li><li>The AI image editing tools will be accessible through the sparkle icon within the existing menu of WhatsApp's image editor.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp may be tinkering with some generative AI image-editing features, which were initially teased back in September.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Whatsapp-Image-Editing-AI-Tools.html" target="_blank">AssembleDebug</a>, who dug into the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> beta release for Android (v2.24.7.13), these AI-powered editing tools are going to let you spice up your images. For instance, you can slap on text-to-image backdrops, tweak your pictures with some style, and even expand the background.</p><p>As per the tipster, when you&apos;re posting a status update or sending an image to someone on WhatsApp, you&apos;ll see these new options—<em>Backdrop</em>, <em>Restyle</em>, and <em>Expand</em>—right there in the image editor window.</p><p>While Meta previously confirmed that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-tests-new-generative-ai-features-across-platforms">adding AI backdrop and image restyling tools for Instagram and Facebook</a>, the company hadn&apos;t let slip anything about these features coming to WhatsApp before.</p><p>As seen in the screenshot below, these AI image editing tools are hiding under the sparkle icon, right up there in the same menu where you find other editing tricks on WhatsApp like rotating, cropping, slapping on stickers, and adding text.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:422px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.73%;"><img id="yjQUsN5ggxBDGbXiaGs9SQ" name="whatsapp-AI-editing-tools.jpg" alt="Whatsapp AI-powered image editors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjQUsN5ggxBDGbXiaGs9SQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="422" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug / TheSpAndroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might have guessed, <em>Backdrop</em> allows for switching up the background by typing in a text prompt. <em>Restyle</em> is more about jazzing up the whole image with cool effects. And if you need to go bigger, <em>Expand</em> lets you enlarge those images.</p><p>That said, using AI to stretch or extend an image&apos;s background isn&apos;t exactly new news. Adobe Photoshop has already been offering a similar feature with its own AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-photography-apps-android">image-editing tools</a>.</p><p>AssembleDebug mentioned he couldn&apos;t quite get the new features up and running yet. So, it looks like while this feature is in the works, the actual features might still be under development. So, we&apos;re still in the dark about how Restyle, Backdrop, and Expand will actually appear in the app.</p><p>WhatsApp loves rolling out new features regularly to keep its loyal users hooked and to lure in fresh faces, and these AI-powered tools may help keep things exciting and draw in new users.</p><p>Sure, there&apos;s often some concern about AI messing with our images, but the idea of easily sprucing up pictures for quicker sharing seems pretty harmless. It just means WhatsApp messages could come with nicer-looking images without us breaking a sweat.</p>

Feeling lost? Let me recap.</p><p>There I was, enjoying my experience with my precious <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>, and things were going great. It lived up to my expectations; it made me happy. Sadly, it was not a perfect relationship. Roughly two years of short-lived happiness ended abruptly, and we broke up.</p><p>The reason why I ended up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">dumping the Pixel 6</a> was simple: it just wasn&apos;t usable every day anymore. The device would hang up on me, I had a ton of network problems, and the Bluetooth would only play nice when it was in the mood. Google didn&apos;t design the Pixel 6 for sustained heavy usage, and the phone just couldn&apos;t take it anymore.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8tXJ5t3pZfs2Yqyg5AhBJ9" name="google-pixel-6-6pro-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro and Google Pixel 6 standing upright on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tXJ5t3pZfs2Yqyg5AhBJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once that was done and dusted, my next primary device was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>. This was partly because I was curious and partly because I wanted to reaffirm my belief in the longevity of flagship phones. This experiment had a more cheerful ending, leading me to conclude that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-ultra-aged-better-than-pixel-6">Samsung&apos;s phones age far more gracefully than Pixels</a>.</p><p>Now, I have taken everyone — including myself — by surprise and have cautiously switched back to a Google Pixel — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, to be more specific. Before you grab your pitchforks and torches, calm yourself. No, I am not a "hater" of either phone, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, so I have no issue bouncing back and forth between either brand or even using both simultaneously.</p><p>What&apos;s ultimately the most important factor isn&apos;t brand loyalty. All I care about (and so should you) is a good quality product that&apos;s worth my while and my hard-earned money. But there&apos;s more to the story than just curiosity.</p><p>Sure, I wanted to test out the latest Pixel to see for myself whether it had improved over the Pixel 6. But I was also sorely missing a couple of Pixel-exclusive features that no other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> has.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a> is, in my opinion, the most underrated Pixel feature of them all. This music identification feature is seamless, automatic, and so darn good at what it&apos;s supposed to do.</p><p>You no longer have to ask, "Hey, what song is that?" because the Pixel does it for you. It records the song with a time stamp, lets you browse the list and favorite tracks, and you can even share songs right out of the Now Playing app.</p><p>Forget Shazam, Now Playing is the ultimate song tracker slash audio identification app, and it is baked into modern Pixels. I tried to use alternatives on my Samsung, but nothing came close to this. There isn&apos;t a lock screen widget that&apos;s as good as this, either.</p>

<p>It had become somewhat of a weird tradition for everyone in the household to start yelling "STAHPP" at my Pixel every time the alarm would ring.</p><p>In case you weren&apos;t aware, you can simply command your Pixel&apos;s alarm to turn off verbally when it goes off. This includes simple answers like "snooze" or "stop," but because the alarm is pretty loud, you need to be a bit louder when speaking to your Pixel.</p><p>Call it an idiosyncrasy, but I missed screaming at my Pixel to turn off the alarm. It&apos;s dumb, it&apos;s chaotic, but it&apos;s also fun. The fact that it confuses people hanging around you is an added bonus. It&apos;s a great conversation starter if anything. Every phone should have this feature.</p>

<p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Android 12 Material You</a> facelift, Android on a Pixel is unmatched. The UI is mouth-wateringly delish to look at. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> has an even better look, and I absolutely love the look of my Pixel 8 running it.</p><p>Although One UI and dynamic color theming as well as themed icons, it just doesn&apos;t have the soul of a Pixel. The charm of the stock Android phone lies in the little things like the shape of the Quick Settings menu, the clock, the At a glance widget, and the fluid animations.</p><p>It&apos;s so easy to get used to the subtle software tweaks added by Google. I almost forgot that all phones don&apos;t have the ability to copy text from just about anywhere or translate text selected within an app without taking screenshots or any extra steps. Then there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, all of which deliver superior results.</p><p>Once you get used to Google&apos;s spin on stock Android, it&apos;s really hard to move on from there. Despite switching over to Samsung&apos;s better-functioning phone, I still yearned for these little built-in options and abilities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-makes-pixel-8-stand-out-among-other-android-phones">No one does cool, seamless software tweaks like Google does</a>.</p>

<p>This section is extremely subjective, but I&apos;m the expert here so bear that in mind before bullying me in the comments section. I&apos;ve tested tons and tons of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, and when it comes to picture quality and color, Google is the undisputed champ.</p><p>Between the iPhone 15, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-google-pixel-8">Galaxy S24, and the Pixel 8</a>, the Pixel wins the battle when it comes to photography. Hand on my heart, the Pixel 8&apos;s camera is superior. I find the camera app to be more user-friendly, with easily findable and usable modes and just better photography overall.</p><p>I love the color tones and accuracy that the Pixel 8 delivers, with vibrant hues that are true to life. The level of detail is stunning, and the motion unblur kicks Samsung and Apple&apos;s butts. Night mode is phenomenal, too.</p><p>I&apos;m not here to persuade you that the Pixel 8 has the best cameras. Picture quality is subjective to the eye of the beholder. For me, Google has the right formula, but it might not be the same for you. However, this was a big feature that I craved when using the Samsung phone as my primary device. And it&apos;s not just my Pixel 8; my Pixel 6 could whoop the S22 Ultra with its hands tied behind its back. Photography is Google&apos;s forte, so if you ever ditch a Pixel, you&apos;ll miss the photography experience.</p>
<hr>
<p>This doesn&apos;t make up for the poor build quality and longevity of Pixels in general, nor does it negate my poor experience with the Pixel 6. However, these features are enough to make me want to give Google&apos;s Pixel ecosystem another shot. It makes me hope that the Pixel 8 doesn&apos;t walk down the Pixel 6&apos;s path, and though there&apos;s no way for me to confirm this right now, only time will tell whether newer Pixels are built to last.</p>

<ul><li>Google added support for 30 U.S. banks to the Google Wallet app in March, bringing the total number of supported banks to over 5,000.</li><li>The move follows roughly a hundred new banks that were added to Google Wallet in December and January.</li><li>Google's growing base of supported banks in Google Wallet comes as the company plans for a Google Pay shutdown in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Wallet is getting bolstered with new features each month as it becomes Google&apos;s primary digital banking and wallet app on Android. The company previously announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">Google Pay will officially be shut down</a> on June 4, 2024, at least in the U.S. Ahead of the forced transition, Google is making sure as many banks are supported in Google Wallet as possible. In March, that meant adding 30 new banks to the Google Wallet app in the U.S. </p><p>Google has made steady progress adding supported banks to the Google Wallet app in the U.S. It brought 42 new banking institutions on board in January, and 44 banks joined in December 2023. Now, as documented on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059326?co=GENIE.CountryCode%3DUS&sjid=12120385823364741247-AP#zippy=%2Cother-participating-banks" target="_blank">Google support page</a> and first discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-adds-30-new-supported-banks-us-march-2024/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, there are 30 more newcomers in the Google Wallet app. </p><p>Below is the full list of banks added to the Google Wallet app this month, including financial institutions from 14 different U.S. states. People who use these banks can now add digital bank cards to the Google Wallet app for Android. </p>
<ul><li>AtoB </li><li>Bank of Odessa (MO) </li><li>Beach Cities Commercial Bank (CA) </li><li>BFG Federal Credit Union (OH) </li><li>Chillicothe State Bank (MO) </li><li>Citizens Bank of Eldon (MO) </li><li>Coastlife Credit Union (TX) </li><li>Community Bank of Oelwein (IA) </li><li>CorePlus Federal Credit Union (CT) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants Bank (Cannon Falls, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (Fairmont, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (Luverne, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants State Bank (Brownsdale, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants State Bank of Grand Meadow (MN) </li><li>First National Bank of Le Center (MN) </li><li>First State Bank (OH) </li><li>Fortress Bank (IA) </li><li>Lusitania Savings Bank (NJ) </li><li>One Detroit Credit Union (MI) </li><li>Pacific Postal Credit Union (CA) </li><li>Pay by Extend </li><li>Ravalli County Federal Credit Union (MT) </li><li>Sidney State Bank (MI) </li><li>Sixth Avenue Baptist Federal Credit Union (AL) </li><li>SubZero / Avaya </li><li>The Bank of Star Valley (WY) </li><li>Waterfall Bank (FL) </li><li>Windward Bank </li><li>Xformative Payment Systems (NY)</li></ul>
<p>You&apos;ll notice immediately that many of these banks are smaller, and you might not have even heard of them before. In fact, six First Farmers & Merchants branches are included in the total of 30 new banks added to Google Wallet in March. That&apos;s partly because nearly all of the major U.S. banks are already supported by Google Wallet. In total, more than 5,000 banks in the U.S. work with Google Wallet. </p><p>Still, it&apos;s important for Google to continue working with smaller, local banks to get them into the Google Wallet. Not everyone uses a major bank, so getting these niche institutions onboard is key to making the Google Wallet ubiquitous among Android users. </p><p>Beyond bank cards, Google is actively adding support for new features in the Google Wallet app. It previously announced plans to add more supported U.S. state IDs this year. More recently, Google made it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-support-apple-wallet-file-format">use Apple Wallet passes in the Google Wallet app</a>.</p>
