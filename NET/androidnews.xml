<h2 id="samsung-has-you-covered-for-a-very-long-time-2">Samsung has you covered for a very long time</h2>
<p>Software updates for Android phones used to be quite haphazard, with some taking too long to release new updates and patches, while others simply abandoning updates after the first couple of years. Today, phone manufacturers are taking software updates more seriously, as are consumers, and we can thank Apple for this. iPhones typically get five years of major iOS upgrades, and it&apos;s often more. </p><p>Now, some of the main Android smartphone OEMs have matched and even exceeded Apple&apos;s commitment. Google raised the bar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8 series</a> by committing to seven years of OS upgrades and security patches, and Samsung followed suit this year. It started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 series</a>, which is also slated to get seven years of OS and security support, and that continues with its latest foldables.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s sustainability push in all its products, especially premium devices, can be fruitful if consumers use its products for longer. This would typically happen only if that device was supported for a long time. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> gets the same seven years of support for OS upgrades and security patches. Its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a>, is expected to get four years of OS upgrades and five years of security patches. </p><p>In recent times, Samsung&apos;s update record has been pretty good and we hope this continues going ahead too. The Z Flip 6 is currently one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in the market, and the fact that it will be supported till 2031 makes it worth buying if you&apos;re someone who doesn&apos;t like to switch phones every few years. On the other hand, if you have the habit of getting something new every couple of years, then this probably won&apos;t affect you too much. You could get a better resale price though when you go to trade in your Z Flip 6 some years down the line, as it should still be up to date.</p>

<p>Samsung has launched its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 6. This is the successor to last year&apos;s Z Fold 5, and it brings with it a bunch of updates. Just like the S24 series, Samsung&apos;s focus is squarely on its Galaxy AI features in the new foldable. Software aside, the new phone does come with some notable upgrades, some of which we&apos;ve been wanting to see for a while. But does it make it a better choice than the Z Fold 5?</p><p>The 2023 foldable recently got Galaxy AI features too via an update and its feature set was pretty solid to begin with. If you&apos;re unable to decide between these two outstanding foldables, let&apos;s take it step by step and see which one has the upper hand.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5-design-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 5: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Bt78ezw2tapN53RqwJY2TU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-all-colors-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bt78ezw2tapN53RqwJY2TU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has yet again played it safe with the design of its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Not that there was anything wrong with the previous one, but the past three generations have looked pretty much the same, with just minor nips and tucks year after year. The flat theme is taken one step further with the Fold 6, which features an even more angular frame with a smaller curvature for the corners. This makes it look almost rectangular when closed or open.</p><p>Although it looks similar to the Fold 5 at first glance, the improvements are noticeable when you hold it. The biggest, and most welcomed, change is the lighter weight of 239g, which is 14g less than the Fold 5. This makes it as heavy as the OnePlus Open, but it&apos;s still not as light as the Vivo X Fold 3 Pro. The Fold 6 is also 2.7mm wider and 1.4mm shorter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5, which means you won&apos;t be able to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-cases">best cases for the Fold 5</a> on the new model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4U64mJbvkNt6PRQtagLZpd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-pink-hinge.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4U64mJbvkNt6PRQtagLZpd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung claims to have made other improvements too on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 like 10% better scratch resistance on the frame and hinge, new materials for the hinge, and better tolerance to pressure and sharp objects for the folding edge of the display. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-should-you-buy">Z Fold 6 comes in three shades</a> including Pink, Navy, and Silver, but there are also White and Crafted Black (carbon fibre finish) colors if you buy it directly from Samsung.com.</p><p>The final big update to the design is the IP48 certification, which seems like a big upgrade but I don&apos;t think it is. The Fold 5 was already IPX8 rated, so the waterproofing portion (&apos;8&apos;) is the same. The Fold 6 now gets an official &apos;4&apos; rating for solid particle resistance but this is only valid for objects greater than 1mm. A rating of &apos;5&apos; and above guarantees protection against smaller particles like dust, which is what we really wanted.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NXtDAFJCQbFCKepDpKjpDU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-back-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXtDAFJCQbFCKepDpKjpDU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> brought some big changes to the design like a thinner and lighter chassis, and a reworked hinge that allowed the phone to fold flat without leaving any gap. This might not seem very impressive on paper, but it makes a big impact when you actually hold and use it in its folded state. Like the Fold 6, the Fold 5 also uses Gorilla Glass Victus 2 over the outer display and back panel. The frame is Samsung&apos;s "Armor Aluminum" which we&apos;ve never had any issues with in terms of durability.</p><p>The Z Fold 5 comes in Icy Blue, Phantom Black, and Cream, but you can get it in Gray and Blue via Samsung&apos;s own online store. The phone weighs 252g, which is a bit heavy and something that you will notice initially till you get used to it. It does not get any official protection against dust, although I do believe it should be just as resilient against smaller objects like the Fold 6.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ijEmBGTckNcya5oWV9NSHJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-s-pen-case-blue-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 official cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ijEmBGTckNcya5oWV9NSHJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No prizes for guessing the biggest upgrade in the Z Fold 6&apos;s hardware. That&apos;s right, it comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy SoC, just like the S24 series. You can expect higher benchmark scores and smoother gaming performance in really demanding titles. The new chip is also more power efficient, so battery life should be slightly better too.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs $100 more than its predecessor (again, no surprise there) starting at $1,899.99. There are three storage variants, like last time, and you get 12GB of RAM in all of them. Battery capacity is also the same at 4,400mAh, and you don&apos;t get a charger in the box. Wired charging is still limited to 25W, along with 15W wireless charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QN85g8fzg98oeUSwRzFWFK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-display-corners.jpg" alt="The bright display and square corners of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QN85g8fzg98oeUSwRzFWFK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has made a few changes to the displays. The outer screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a bit larger at 6.3 inches and is slightly wider with a 22.1:9 aspect ratio. This means it should be a little easier to type with both hands. The increase in size has also driven the resolution up slightly to 2,376x986. Other specs are nearly the same as before like the Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel and the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. The latter can now drop down to 1Hz when needed, compared to 48Hz on the older model.</p><p>The inner folding display has the same 7.6-inch diagonal width, but the corners are squared off so it appears a bit larger. The aspect ratio is a bit wider at 20.9:18, and the resolution is now 2,160x1,856. It has gotten brighter, as Samsung is claiming a peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits, up from 1,750 nits on the Fold 5. This should make consuming content under direct sunlight easier to view, with richer colors. The Fold 6 also supports the S Pen Fold Edition and S Pen Pro.</p>

<p>The hardware in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 has aged well and is still very relevant a year down the line. It&apos;s powered by the excellent Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy SoC, which we found to deliver very good system and gaming performance when we reviewed it. This phone also has 12GB of RAM and comes in three storage variants. Prices start at $1,799.99, although with the Z Fold 6 now in the picture, you should expect a permanent price cut or at least be able to find a good deal on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">Amazon Prime Day</a>.</p><p>The Z Fold 5 has the same battery capacity and charging tech as the Fold 6, although the latter&apos;s latest software and more efficient chip could help it get slightly better battery life. The Fold 5&apos;s inner and outer displays produce excellent colors and brightness, making it great for content consumption. We did face a few issues though like the prominent crease in the middle of the folding display, annoying flicker at all brightness levels due to PWM dimming (if your eyes are sensitive to it), and the reflective PET screen protector on the inner display.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 ships with Android 14 out of the box, with its One UI 6.1.1 skin. Just like the S24 series, the Fold 6 will also get seven years of OS upgrades and security patches, which is longer than most people would probably own this phone for. Galaxy AI is baked in, which now has some new features for the Fold 6.</p><p>Note Assist on Samsung Notes lets you do translation, summaries, and auto-formatting.  The PDF overlay translation feature lets you translate text directly into the PDF itself. The new &apos;Sketch to image&apos; feature offers image options based on rough sketches or drawings done with the S Pen. Meanwhile, Photo Assist lets you create professional-looking images based on different types of artwork and visual styles. All of the features we&apos;ve already seen in the Galaxy S24 phones like Interpreter and Live Translate are also available on the Fold 6.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 shipped with One UI 5.1.1 based on Android 13 when it launched last year, but it has begun receiving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> update recently. This means you will be able to most of the Galaxy AI features on the Fold 5 as well. Some of the newer features in the Fold 6 should also eventually make their way to the Fold 5 in future updates. In terms of software updates, the Z Fold 5 is set to get five years of OS and security updates.</p>

<p>Samsung hasn&apos;t messed around with the cameras all that much on the new Galaxy Z Fold 6. The hardware has stayed pretty much the same, although Samsung says that the ultrawide camera is using a new 12MP sensor. While it&apos;s not the most exciting set of cameras on a foldable, it&apos;s not bad news either. The Fold 5 already had a pretty good set of cameras, with improved image quality compared to the Fold 4. Plus, the new ISP in the Fold 6, along with better software tuning, could result in slightly improved image quality. We&apos;ll know for certain once we&apos;ve had a chance to test the phone.</p><p>The Fold 6 has a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization (OIS), a 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 12MP ultrawide camera. On the outer display, it&apos;s the same 10MP selfie camera, while the folding display uses the 4MP under-display camera.</p>

<p>Looking it at it purely from a productivity point of view, which is the main reason you&apos;d consider buying this over an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>, the Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s brighter display and slightly wider aspect ratio give it an advantage over the Fold 5. Even though it&apos;s more expensive, I feel it&apos;s worth the little extra if you are going to be paying full price for the Fold 5 anyway. As a bonus, you get an extra year of software support, the latest processor, and for what it&apos;s worth, an official IP48 rating. Plus, the new colors look pretty cool. It&apos;s no doubt one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in the market right now.</p><p>If you&apos;re buying a foldable purely for the novelty of it or to watch videos on a much larger screen, I&apos;d recommend waiting for a good deal on the Z Fold 5. It&apos;s nearly every bit as good as the newer model and should be getting a decent price cut soon. Keep in mind that its display might not suit you if your eyes are sensitive to flicker, in which case, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> might be a better option.</p>

You can also consider the <strong>middle</strong> finger. Your pinky will be too small to get a good reading; your thumb may be too short and active to find a convenient spot for continuous data.</p>
<p>Samsung recommended during our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring hands-on</a> that people wear it on their pointer finger, with the ring finger as a backup option. They said you'll want it to slide on your finger somewhat easily but have some resistance coming off so it's not too loose for accurate readings.</p>
<p>During a private Q&A session with the Galaxy Ring product team, they said people should use the Galaxy Ring sizing kit to "choose which finger they want to wear it on or try different sizes on different fingers." In other words, they expect people to wear the Galaxy Ring on whichever finger they find comfortable.</p>
<p>Samsung sells a sizing kit through retailers, or sends it for free if you buy the Galaxy Ring from samsung.com. The Galaxy Ring comes in nine sizes that don't conform to any universal size chart, so you'll want to try it on various fingers first and see which is comfortable for daily use, sleep tracking, and workout tracking.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="why-choosing-the-right-samsung-galaxy-ring-finger-matters-x2014-and-why-it-apos-s-not-the-same-for-everyone-2">Why choosing the right Samsung Galaxy Ring finger matters—and why it&apos;s not the same for everyone</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> has a few non-health features like gesture controls, but you&apos;re mainly wearing it to get insights into your heart health, sleep quality, and fitness goals. If you buy the wrong-sized Galaxy Ring for your hand, you&apos;re essentially paying $399 for nothing, because the data will be inaccurate.</p><p>Whether you buy the Galaxy Ring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a>, or any other smart ring, you should wear it on one of your three middle fingers. Which you choose will depend on your preferences; this informal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/13dp9ek/on_which_finger_do_you_wear_the_oura_ring/" target="_blank">Oura subreddit poll</a>, for example, shows that 44% wear it on their index finger, 26% on their ring finger, and 26% on their middle finger out of 1,500 people.</p><p>As we explained above, Samsung doesn&apos;t require you to wear the Galaxy Ring on your index finger to get good results. Case in point, the Galaxy Ring&apos;s double-pinch gesture works "on all fingers wearing rings" according to the fine-print on Samsung&apos;s promotional materials. They wouldn&apos;t specify that unless they expected people to wear the Galaxy Ring wherever they wanted.</p><p>Whichever finger you choose, we do suggest wearing it on your non-dominant hand. Even though the Galaxy Ring is slimmer and lighter than most smart rings, it&apos;s still noticeably thick. It&apos;ll feel intrusive when holding objects like utensils or other daily actions you normally don&apos;t think about, like using the bathroom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JB8uQqg5iwgkgZ6rYKx85L" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-sizing-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Ring sizes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JB8uQqg5iwgkgZ6rYKx85L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Different Samsung Galaxy Ring sizes </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you choose a finger and size, <strong>wear the Galaxy Ring dummy ring for 24 hours</strong>, including one night of fake sleep tracking, before you buy it. Your finger size naturally changes at different times of day, and something snugly comfortable during the day could become uncomfortably tight at night. </p><p>That also applies during workouts, where higher heart rates swell your fingers. Unlike a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>—where you can adjust the band to any wrist size—your only recourse with a smart ring is to switch to a different finger entirely.</p><p>That&apos;s why many people wear their smart rings on different fingers for different activities. You could swap from your index finger to your ring finger at night, for instance. But it really depends on how well Samsung&apos;s unique ring sizes match with your hand size.</p>

<p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, I originally measured it for my dominant index finger without realizing (A) it would get in the way and (B) it got a bit tight at night. Thankfully, my left index finger was only slightly smaller, and it ended up being less annoying at night while still giving me a proper seal during the day.</p><p>Ultimately, the best Galaxy Ring finger to choose is <em>probably</em> your non-dominant index finger. But if you want to wear it as a techy wedding band, that should give you similar results so long as it&apos;s fitted well. We&apos;ve found smart rings more uncomfortable when worn on the middle finger, but this comes down to preference.</p><p>Now that you know which Galaxy Ring finger is the best option, you may want to check whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-vs-oura-ring-gen-3">Galaxy Ring or Oura Ring</a> is your best smart ring option in general!</p>

This means you can safely swim with it down to depths that are twice as deep as with most other standard smartwatches. Combined with ultra-rugged materials, it’s one of the most durable smartwatches you can buy.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-is-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-apos-s-waterproof-rating-2">What is the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s waterproof rating?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> meets a 10ATM water resistance rating. This means you can swim down to as far as 100 meters with it for up to 10 minutes. The IP68 rating also means you can swim down to six feet for up to 30 minutes. It’s also protected from dust, though Samsung advises that you should rinse any residue from the Watch after it gets wet.</p><p>The Watch is ultra-durable, made with a Titanium Grade 4 frame and Sapphire Crystal display, so it’s built to withstand not only swimming but also other intense activities. This is also thanks to the MIL-STD-810H rating. This rating from the U.S. Department of Defense Test Method Standard, Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests confirms that it can operate at extreme altitudes and in high and low temperatures, and can withstand temperature shock, rain, humidity, sand and dust, vibrations, and more. </p><p>Indeed, the Watch is rated to function at a wide range of altitudes, from 500 meters below sea level to 9,000 meters high. </p><p>Keep in mind that as with any water-resistant device, the rating pertains to freshwater sources. You should heed caution if you plan to wear the watch in a heavily chlorinated pool or in the saltwater ocean. No water-resistant device is recommended to be used in such scenarios. If you do go for a quick dip, either remove the watch first or make sure to rinse it immediately with fresh water and dry it off to keep it running in optimal shape.</p><p>Also, note that water resistance degrades over time with any device. So, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, which is poised to become one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">the best WearOS watches</a>, is ultra-durable and boasts double the water resistance of most standard smartwatches, you’ll still want to take extra care, especially as it gets older. Consider a waterproof casing for an added layer of protection and additional peace of mind.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Maps now features Immersive View in five major Canadian cities: Montreal, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Edmonton.</li><li>Immersive View transforms flat photos into 3D images of landmarks and buildings using AI, providing a vivid preview.</li><li>It adds details like weather, traffic, and crowd levels, and lets users virtually explore buildings and nearby restaurants.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has updated its Maps platform in Canada with a nifty update for city explorers. Now live in five of the country&apos;s biggest cities, this update brings a new level of immersive navigation.</p><p>In a blog post, Google shared that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-maps-immersive-view">Immersive View</a> is now live in Montreal, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Edmonton. Powered by AI, it transforms flat photos into 3D images of landmarks, restaurants, and certain buildings.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-immersive-view-rollout">Launched in February of last year</a>, the feature first rolled out in a few cities like London, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo.</p><p>Immersive View helps you plan your trips and get a better feel for a city before you even get there. It combines billions of Street View and aerial photos to create a detailed digital model of an area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.08%;"><img id="vArwKxbkyXetHKjgGesZ4C" name="immersive-view-google-maps-1.gif" alt="immersive view in google maps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vArwKxbkyXetHKjgGesZ4C.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="240" height="533" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The feature also adds extra details to the digital model, like weather, traffic, and how crowded a place might be. For example, if you&apos;re planning a trip to the Montreal Forum, Immersive View lets you fly over the building virtually to check out its appearance and entrance locations.</p><p>Additionally, it can point out nearby restaurants and even let you look inside them to decide if they&apos;re a good fit for your plans.</p><p>To give it a try, open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a> and search for a popular spot like the CN Tower in Toronto. For supported landmarks, you&apos;ll see an "Immersive View" card pop up on the left; just tap it to start exploring. If you want to see how the place looks at different times of day or in various weather conditions, tap on "Time & Weather" and slide the bottom bar left or right.</p><p>Despite the undeniable appeal of Immersive View, many users find it challenging to identify which landmarks are compatible with this feature. A comprehensive list of supported locations would greatly benefit those eager to dive into virtual exploration.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 were officially revealed yesterday at a Galaxy Unpacked event. </li><li>Although both phones are iterative upgrades compared to their predecessor, they come with a $100 price increase.</li><li>The lack of improvement in the smartphone market, specifically the foldable sector, calls into question whether we really need yearly upgrades.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The dust is starting to settle from Samsung’s summer Galaxy Unpacked event, which introduced a handful of new Galaxy phones and wearables. This is usually the time when we’d start to get excited about Samsung foldables, but the last few years were underwhelming. This year didn’t break the trend, as the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 were overshadowed by the new Galaxy Ring, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> packs more improvements than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, though both devices received a spec bump, thanks to the inclusion of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset. Still, it’s hard to see Samsung’s upgrades here as anything but the bare minimum. Samsung had a tight grasp on the foldable phone market at some point, but that grasp is slipping. </p>

<p>Phones available in other markets, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor Magic V2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivos-latest-foldables-make-the-galaxy-z-fold-5-look-outdated">Vivo X Fold 3</a>, have better technology inside. OnePlus beat Samsung on its turf — even though the company is based in South Korea, it’s dominated the U.S. foldable market in the past — last year with the release of the OnePlus Open. Samsung’s moves to make the Galaxy Z Fold 6 cover screen wider and the overall chassis thinner were ones that it had to make if it wanted to have a chance at competing with Honor, Vivo, and Oppo on the spec sheet.</p><p>Things get worse when you start to peek at the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is virtually unchanged from the Galaxy Z Flip 5. The cover screen isn’t any bigger, and this makes the Galaxy Z Flip 6 pale in comparison to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and even the 2023 version as well. While Motorola has essentially made the Razr Plus cover screen a full-fledged Android smartphone, Samsung appears to be content with keeping the Flip cover screen as a glorified smartwatch. It has some widgets, games, and limited app support but not much else.</p>

<p>And don’t even get me started on the cameras. Seriously, I have no idea how Samsung can keep getting away with this. It’s selling a $1,900 phone with the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S24 — which costs just $799. The camera system on the Z Fold 6 is now three years old, and it’s almost laughable. Folding phones will naturally come with trade-offs compared to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship counterparts</a>, but that doesn’t excuse Samsung‘s neglect of the cameras of its most expensive phone.</p><p>It’s true that Samsung slightly improved the main camera on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and it looks to be the best camera on a clamshell foldable sold in the U.S. for the second year in a row. However, it feels like another case of the company doing the bare minimum. Why didn’t the Galaxy Z Fold 6 get the same treatment?</p><p><em>It all begs the question: who’s buying the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6? </em>It’s obviously not the owners of last year’s foldables because barely anything has changed. It’s also probably not the owners of the Galaxy Z Fold 4, and I’d know because I’m one of them.</p>

<h2 id="not-worth-the-upgrade-2">Not worth the upgrade</h2>
<p>I have the Galaxy Z Fold 4, and I’ve grown tired of the tiny cover screen and weak cameras. The problem is that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 — which is two generations newer and $100 more expensive than my phone was — isn’t materially different in those areas. Everyone’s talking about the bigger screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but it’s still a weird size and aspect ratio compared to the OnePlus Open and Pixel Fold. Those devices feel like a normal smartphone when closed, whereas the latest Samsung foldables feel like devices you need to use opened up.</p><p>That sums up the core issue with Samsung’s complacency. It’s going to affect sales eventually. Right now, I’d recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> over the Z Fold 6 for someone looking for a big-screen foldable in the U.S. I might even recommend the Pixel Fold to the right person, and if they’re lucky enough to have access to Asian foldables, it’s not even a competition. </p><p>For someone looking for a smaller foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> undoubtedly has better hardware than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. You have to deal with worse software support, but that might be a worthy tradeoff. The bottom line is that if you want the best foldable tech in North America today, it’s not coming from Samsung. </p>

<p>Smartphones should be released on a yearly basis, although that doesn’t mean you should buy them on a yearly basis. By offering new phones each year, companies offer consumers the best phone they can provide at any time. No matter when you need to upgrade or what cycle you’re on, you have a predictable release schedule to inform your purchasing decision. </p><p>However, it’s clear that every year can’t be a minor refresh. Eventually, something has to give, and companies need to innovate in a material way. I hoped this would be the year for Samsung, as it’s facing more competition than ever. That didn’t pan out, and until Samsung starts to take foldables seriously, I won’t upgrade to a new one.</p>

<ul><li>Google is discontinuing the Google One VPN service later this year, as it announced in April 2024.</li><li>Some features will be deprecated completely, but the dark web reports feature is staying as a free feature for all Google users.</li><li>Making the functionality free for everyone could help people become more aware of their online safety.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> is the company’s subscription service, and it’s fairly all-encompassing. It includes cloud storage, access to Google Photos features, and even artificial intelligence software — if you pay extra. This subscription may have left the company spread thin, as it announced in April that two Google One features will be sunset: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-one-vpn-will-be-sunset-later-this-year">the Google One VPN service</a> and free shipping for Google Photos prints. However, one key part of the Google One VPN will be made free for all users later this month. </p><p>Google originally said that people weren’t using the Google One VPN service enough, so it would rather focus on other, more desired features instead. To replace it, the company is continuing to offer the Pixel VPN service it promised for a five-year period with the purchase of recent Pixel devices. It’s now available outside the Google One app in anticipation of the One VPN service‘s discontinuation. Users can also turn to third-party VPN services to fill the gap. </p><p>Bundled with the Google One VPN is a feature called dark web report, which provides subscribers with insights on their data — specifically account login details and personal information — and whether it has been leaked. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/09/google-one-dark-web-reports-all-google-accounts/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this feature will live on after One VPN is discontinued. A banner in the Google One app now explains that starting in late July, the dark web reports will have a new home and won’t require a subscription.</p><p>”Dark web report will become available to all users with a consumer Google Account,” the company explains, as reported by 9to5Google. “Dark web report is integrated with Results about you as a combined solution to help users protect their online presence.”</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Results About You is an existing Google feature that helps you manage your information on the web. As explained by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/12719076?hl=en" target="_blank">support document</a>, this feature will let you find information about yourself that appears in search results. For accuracy and thoroughness, you can enter your name, address, phone number, and other personal identifiers. Google will show you what’s on the web related to you, and can also send you notifications when new results are found.</p><p>After reviewing your information, you can request the removal of a result you’re unhappy with. Google might side with you and remove the result if it is on a questionable website and was posted without your consent. However, the company does consider certain types of information valuable to the public and won’t remove URLs from search results that are from governments or media outlets, for example.</p><p>Results about you are found in the Google app on mobile or in Google account settings on the web. Now that dark web reports will be found there as well, they’re a bit harder to access than they were in their prior location in the Google One app. Keeping the two features together makes sense, though. If a dark web report tells you that your personal information has been compromised, you might want to then scan Results about you for leaks across the web.</p>
<h2 id="why-dark-web-reports-could-be-a-good-move-2">Why dark web reports could be a good move</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="onsSSqrhAHV8r5dBQcWTHm" name="Google-One-Dark-web-report.jpg" alt="Google One Dark Web Report" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/onsSSqrhAHV8r5dBQcWTHm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The exciting thing about Google’s announcement is not that dark web reports are moving — it’s that they’ll soon be free for all. Subscriptions feel like they’re necessary for big tech corporations these days, because they have to show their shareholders that they’re continuously growing. However, I think some things shouldn’t be a paid feature. Functionality that helps people stay safe and protect their privacy should be free.</p><p>That’s exactly what dark web reports do. You can upload the following data fields to your profile, and Google can search the dark web to see if they pop up anywhere. If they appear in a dark web report, you know they’ve been compromised.</p>
<ul><li>Your name</li><li>Address</li><li>Phone number</li><li>Email</li><li>Social Security Number (SSN)</li><li>Username</li><li>Password</li></ul>
<p>If these types of personal identifiers were to leak on the dark web, there could be serious consequences. You only get one social security number, and it becoming compromised could result in identity theft and a lifetime of hassle. I’m not saying you should give Google your SSN for dark web reports — I probably wouldn’t in fact — but it just goes to show how vital these identifiers are and how useful the reports can be. </p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2023-online-safety">previously</a> made dark web reports for email available for all Gmail users, but widespread searches have been an exclusive perk of Google One until now.</p><p>Even if you stick to the basics, like name, address, and email, it’ll be helpful to know what kind of data is on the web. For example, if you see that your email is appearing on the dark web, you might want to be more cautious when receiving unsolicited messages and enhance spam filters. Or, you could start to expect junk mail in your mailbox if your address is compromised. And if you upload usernames and passwords, you’ll know if it’s time to change them for your security. </p><p>Data leaks happen all the time, as unfortunate as that reality may be. It’s not a question of <em>if</em> your data leaks; it’s a matter of <em>when</em> your data leaks. With the dark web reports becoming available to everyone, you’ll know when it does.</p>

It <em>looks</em> different with its circular display, but nearly all of its upgrades are inspired by (or copied directly from) Apple&apos;s flagship watch. And I don&apos;t mind this!

And all of its key upgrades — the high-grade titanium built to withstand altitude and diving, an emergency siren, extra button shortcuts, a 3,000-nit display, similar sporty bands, and the overall squircle shape — are inspired (if not copied) from Apple.</p><p>And as I said, this doesn&apos;t bother me. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is great! And Samsung addressed my main criticisms of it: the Galaxy Watch Ultra allegedly lasts 60 hours with AOD vs. Apple&apos;s 36 hours without AOD, and costs $150 less.</p><p>But <em>why</em>, oh why, did Samsung release a smartwatch for athletes without a physically rotating bezel, a crown, or up/down buttons? There isn&apos;t even a digital bezel; all you can do is swipe!</p>

<p>Samsung has wavered between digital "Active" bezels and physical "Classic" bezels over the last few years, for good reason. I loved my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> for the battery life, but felt that sweaty fingertips and watch displays have always been a match made in hell. Then I loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> for the ease of the tactile physical bezel, while disliking how the extra weight made it a burden to wear.</p><p>I assumed from leaked Watch Ultra renders that it would have a rotating titanium bezel; turns out it&apos;s just shiny metal. I also had a flash of hope that the side orange button would turn out to be a crown, but no such luck. To be honest, I was seeing what I wanted to see.</p><p>Swiping on a touchscreen works perfectly well in normal circumstances, and the lack of an elevated rotating bezel ensures your finger doesn&apos;t feel hemmed in. But while I&apos;m running, hiking, or cycling, the last thing I want is to tap and swipe futilely on a 1.5-inch touchscreen and have my sweat get in the way.</p><p>I can understand why Samsung didn&apos;t add a physical bezel. The Watch Ultra weighs 60.5g without the strap, 1g less than the Apple Watch Ultra 2. That extra bezel would balloon the weight on an already hefty case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-multisport.jpg" alt="Choosing a workout after pressing the action button on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But then it wasn&apos;t willing to add a crown. Maybe that would have made the Galaxy Watch Ultra even more of an Apple Watch Ultra clone, and Samsung wanted to keep its design distinct. But originality is a double-edged sword in this category.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">Fitness watch</a> brands like COROS, Amazfit, TicWatch, and Google Pixel all use crowns. Garmin and Polar stick to the classic up/down buttons, which are slower to press but very reliable when you&apos;re on the move. I&apos;ve seen plenty of debates from athletes and fitness writers on whether crowns or buttons are better.</p><p>I&apos;ve never, ever seen anyone say they prefer using their touchscreen during a workout. Many fitness watches <em>disable</em> their touchscreens during workouts so accidental touches don&apos;t derail your workout tracking. </p><p>So for Samsung to design its expensive Galaxy Watch Ultra with free-spending athletes in mind, without giving them reliable controls during workouts, feels like shooting themselves in the foot. </p><p>I can&apos;t tell you that it&apos;s a deal-breaker until I test it for myself, and it&apos;ll certainly be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">great Android watch</a> for battery life and performance. But since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> also got dual-band GPS, sporty straps, new racing routes, and a 1.5-inch display option for half the price, I wonder if some Android-loving athletes will stick with the cheaper option and accept missing out on the perks. </p>

With the brand effectively unchallenged in the region, there really isn&apos;t any need to innovate or come up with differentiated products, so Samsung has been churning out the same phone year over year for the better part of three years.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>This is the case with its latest foldables; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Z Flip 6</a> don&apos;t have any meaningful hardware upgrades outside of IP48 ingress protection, and they&apos;re identical to their predecessors — which were similarly identical to their predecessors, and so on. And because Samsung is inherently aware of the fact that it has no rivals, both devices get a $100 price hike.</p><p>The U.S. market routinely misses out on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, but there&apos;s at least some variety in this area. With foldables, that gulf is clearly noticeable — Chinese manufacturers are constantly pushing the boundaries in this segment, and all of the 2024 foldables I&apos;ve used thus far have been nothing short of incredible.</p><p>But these brands don&apos;t have any presence in the U.S., the one region where foldables are actually selling well. That leaves potential foldable customers locked into Samsung&apos;s orbit of indifference, and based on what I&apos;ve seen of the new launches, that trajectory is firmly pointed toward mediocrity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-v2-rsr-16.jpg" alt="Porsche Design Honor Magic V2 RSR review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung can get away with this because it knows there really isn&apos;t another alternative in the U.S. There are standout foldables available today — Honor&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> and Vivo X Fold 3 Pro immediately come to mind — but these devices aren&apos;t coming to the U.S. Even with foldables that are sold officially in the country, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, you can only buy it unlocked at OnePlus and Amazon, and without any carrier backing, the device doesn&apos;t move the needle in any measurable way.</p>
<p>It&apos;s not just the foldables either; Samsung introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> — which is a blatant copy of Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Watch Ultra</a> — and the Buds 3 Pro eschewed their original design to mimic AirPods. The only new product I was interested in was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a>, but Samsung somehow found a way to hobble that — the smart ring only works with Samsung phones, so if you have an Android device from any other manufacturer, it will not connect to it.</p><p>This decision runs counter to the fundamental openness of Android, and it&apos;s clear at this point that Samsung has lost its ability to innovate. As the largest Android manufacturer, Samsung is in a unique position to affect change in the industry, and I&apos;ve often pointed out that it needs to take that responsibility seriously. But now, it&apos;s evident that all Samsung wants to do is consolidate its position and rehash the same product lines, safe in the knowledge that it doesn&apos;t have any meaningful rivals.</p>

<p>I'll be upfront and say that I don't like what Samsung is doing with its foldables; the Galaxy Z Fold 6 retains the same design as its predecessor, and that means you still get the same narrow cover screen that doesn't allow you to do much. As someone who uses the cover screen predominantly, the Z Fold 6 is a non-starter for my own use. That said, Samsung rolled out the usual yearly upgrades: the phone is more powerful, has better ingress protection, and comes with a slate of AI features. However, the fundamentals are unchanged, and you'll need to pay an additional premium this year — which just isn't worth it.</p></p>

The 5.8-inch cover screen is great to use, and it unfolds to 7.6 inches — the same size as the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The quality of the panels is excellent, you get one of the strongest camera packages in this segment, and you get Google's clean software with a ton of useful extras. That said, the Pixel Fold is 54g heavier than Samsung's offering, it doesn't fold fully flat, and you can't buy it in most global markets.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5CdQudR4ncWEEmChybQ7aj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-all-colors-01.jpg" alt="All three colors of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CdQudR4ncWEEmChybQ7aj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung doesn&apos;t like changing the design of its devices, and that&apos;s evident when you take a look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The foldable is a smidgen thinner and taller than its predecessor, but the overall design is identical. The only difference is that the cameras have slightly bigger rings encircling each module, but other than that, there&apos;s no telling that you&apos;re using Samsung&apos;s latest-gen foldable.</p><p>The other key difference is that the Z Fold 6 is lighter; at 239g, it is 16g lighter than its predecessor, and you can feel that when using the device. Samsung is also using the latest iteration of its Armor Aluminum chassis, and that should allow the Z Fold 6 to be resilient in daily use. The hinge isn&apos;t as smooth to articulate as the Magic V2 or other 2024 foldables I&apos;ve used, and it is quite stiff.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dkUzZMfxpGxDraJZ7LCkhd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-pink-back.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkUzZMfxpGxDraJZ7LCkhd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the addition of IP48 ingress protection gives the Z Fold 6 a distinct advantage in this category; most foldables — including the Pixel Fold — still have an IPX8 rating, and by adding dust resistance into the mix, the Z Fold 6 is able to withstand the elements just that little better.</p><p>Coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, the foldable isn&apos;t going to win any design awards, but Google nailed the fundamentals. It is great to hold and use (if a little wide), and it has the same caliber of build quality as the Z Fold 6. However, the Pixel Fold is one of the heaviest phones you can buy today — if not the heaviest overall. At 283g, it is a full 44g heavier than the Z Fold 6.</p><p>The biggest issue with the design of the Pixel Fold is that it doesn&apos;t fold fully flat, and that gets annoying in daily use. The Z Fold 6 has no such shortcomings, but the downside is that the crease is still noticeable — much more so than most other devices in this segment.</p>

<p>In all measurable metrics, Samsung has the lead in this area; both the inner and outer panels of the Z Fold 6 get brighter than the Pixel Fold, and they get dynamic refresh that goes to 120Hz. But the problem is that Samsung continues to limit the usability of the cover screen, and the 6.3-inch outer screen is just too tall and narrow to get any meaningful work done.</p><p>This has been a constant source of annoyance in the past, and I thought Samsung would amend the situation with the Z Fold 6, but that wasn&apos;t the case. All other foldables have regular-sized outer panels that give you greater flexibility in this regard, just like the Pixel Fold. Although the device has a smaller 5.8-inch panel on the outside, it is much more usable thanks to its 17.4:9 ratio; it&apos;s just better to use to see emails and messaging clients.</p><p>Both devices get the same 7.6-inch inner screen, and the AMOLED panel on Samsung&apos;s offering has better colors and brightness, making it a great choice for streaming content and gaming.</p>

<p>Samsung has a clear edge when it comes to the hardware, and that&apos;s solely down to the use of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Samsung uses a custom version of Qualcomm&apos;s silicon that&apos;s reserved for its devices, and it has slightly higher clocks than the regular model.</p><p>You get 12GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage as standard on the Z Fold 6, along with Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, UWB, AptX HD codecs, and USB-C 3.2 connectivity. There isn&apos;t much missing in this area, and while I wanted Samsung to increase the battery size, the 4400mAh unit should last all day with medium use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yg5LpZqSpg2tuL2NynLvQK" name="google-pixel-fold-holding-reading.jpg" alt="Reading something on the large screen of the Google Pixel Fold with a Dbrand leather skin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yg5LpZqSpg2tuL2NynLvQK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google makes it clear that it doesn&apos;t offer the best internals on its devices, instead prioritizing AI use cases. As a result, the Tensor G2 on the Pixel Fold is distinctly second-rate, and while it is decent enough in daily use, the shortcomings are noticeable when you start running demanding games.</p><p>The Pixel Fold also falls behind in other areas; it uses UFS 3.1 flash storage, and there&apos;s no 1TB option available. Where it does come out ahead is battery life, with the 4821mAh battery able to deliver up to a day&apos;s worth of use consistently. Google also has a distinct advantage in the imaging side of things, and the Pixel Fold takes outstanding photos in just about any scenario.</p><p>It has a decent set of lenses as well, and when you add Google&apos;s camera wizardry, the Pixel Fold remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a> around in this area. Samsung hasn&apos;t changed much with the Z Fold 6, and while it uses last year&apos;s sensors, tweaks to camera algorithms allow the device to take better photos in low-light situations.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-google-pixel-fold-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. Google Pixel Fold: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RFNTxvf39ugoAQDyhaxmtc" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-AI-portrait-03.jpg" alt="Using the AI portraits feature on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RFNTxvf39ugoAQDyhaxmtc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I prefer Google&apos;s software, so it shouldn&apos;t be astonishing that I recommend the Pixel Fold out of these two devices. Samsung has a lot going on with One UI 6.1, and Galaxy AI is legitimately useful — the new drawing feature is undoubtedly cool. That said, the interface is starting to get bloated again, and it just doesn&apos;t have the fluidity that you get with most other manufacturers.</p><p>That said, Samsung is offering seven Android OS updates with the Z Fold 6, and that&apos;s in line with what you get on the Galaxy S24 models. While Google also has the same update policy with the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, the Pixel Fold will only receive two additional Android updates, and that&apos;s a shame.</p>

<p>Usually, I try to recommend one of the devices I&apos;m writing about in these versus posts, but that&apos;s hard to do here. The problem is that neither device is anywhere close to the best that this segment has to offer. Samsung is essentially unchallenged in North America, so it doesn&apos;t need to innovate with its foldable designs, and that is immediately evident when looking at the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Chinese brands offer much better hardware, sleeker designs, and outstanding cameras, but as they don&apos;t sell their foldables in the U.S., you&apos;re essentially left with limited options. If you are interested in a new foldable, I&apos;d suggest getting the OnePlus Open; it has two usable screens, terrific cameras, great software, and stellar battery life. And at $1,699, it undercuts both the Pixel Fold and Z Fold 6.</p><p>Out of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel Fold, I&apos;m inclined to recommend the latter; it has better battery life, and you get two usable screens. Obviously, the hardware isn&apos;t as powerful, and at 283g, it is considerably heavier, but the software is much better overall, and you get better battery life as well.</p>

<p>Samsung has plenty to offer with the Z Fold 6, but the $1,899 asking price makes it a non-starter. There just isn't enough in the way of upgrades to warrant that price, and if you must have a Samsung foldable, you should just get last year's Galaxy Z Fold 5 instead.</p></p>
