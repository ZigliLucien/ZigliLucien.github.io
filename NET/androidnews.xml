                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Oops, I did it again.</p><p>After the Pixel 6 broke my heart, I ended up going back to the Pixel 8. Feeling lost? Let me recap.</p><p>There I was, enjoying my experience with my precious <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>, and things were going great. It lived up to my expectations; it made me happy. Sadly, it was not a perfect relationship. Roughly two years of short-lived happiness ended abruptly, and we broke up.</p><p>The reason why I ended up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">dumping the Pixel 6</a> was simple: it just wasn&apos;t usable every day anymore. The device would hang up on me, I had a ton of network problems, and the Bluetooth would only play nice when it was in the mood. Google didn&apos;t design the Pixel 6 for sustained heavy usage, and the phone just couldn&apos;t take it anymore.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8tXJ5t3pZfs2Yqyg5AhBJ9" name="google-pixel-6-6pro-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro and Google Pixel 6 standing upright on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tXJ5t3pZfs2Yqyg5AhBJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once that was done and dusted, my next primary device was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>. This was partly because I was curious and partly because I wanted to reaffirm my belief in the longevity of flagship phones. This experiment had a more cheerful ending, leading me to conclude that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-ultra-aged-better-than-pixel-6">Samsung&apos;s phones age far more gracefully than Pixels</a>.</p><p>Now, I have taken everyone — including myself — by surprise and have cautiously switched back to a Google Pixel — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, to be more specific. Before you grab your pitchforks and torches, calm yourself. No, I am not a "hater" of either phone, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, so I have no issue bouncing back and forth between either brand or even using both simultaneously.</p><p>What&apos;s ultimately the most important factor isn&apos;t brand loyalty. All I care about (and so should you) is a good quality product that&apos;s worth my while and my hard-earned money. But there&apos;s more to the story than just curiosity.</p><p>Sure, I wanted to test out the latest Pixel to see for myself whether it had improved over the Pixel 6. But I was also sorely missing a couple of Pixel-exclusive features that no other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> has.</p>
<h2 id="now-playing-on-the-pixel-lock-screen-2">Now Playing on the Pixel lock screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD" name="google-pixel-8-now-playing-lock-screen-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Now playing on the Pixel lock screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a> is, in my opinion, the most underrated Pixel feature of them all. This music identification feature is seamless, automatic, and so darn good at what it&apos;s supposed to do.</p><p>You no longer have to ask, "Hey, what song is that?" because the Pixel does it for you. It records the song with a time stamp, lets you browse the list and favorite tracks, and you can even share songs right out of the Now Playing app.</p><p>Forget Shazam, Now Playing is the ultimate song tracker slash audio identification app, and it is baked into modern Pixels. I tried to use alternatives on my Samsung, but nothing came close to this. There isn&apos;t a lock screen widget that&apos;s as good as this, either.</p>
<h2 id="yelling-stop-at-my-phone-apos-s-alarm-to-turn-it-off-2">Yelling STOP at my phone&apos;s alarm to turn it off</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Wyg5pBMj8yjZYbcyhUgwKN" name="google-pixel-8-alarm-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Alarm ringing on a Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wyg5pBMj8yjZYbcyhUgwKN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3172" height="1784" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It had become somewhat of a weird tradition for everyone in the household to start yelling "STAHPP" at my Pixel every time the alarm would ring.</p><p>In case you weren&apos;t aware, you can simply command your Pixel&apos;s alarm to turn off verbally when it goes off. This includes simple answers like "snooze" or "stop," but because the alarm is pretty loud, you need to be a bit louder when speaking to your Pixel.</p><p>Call it an idiosyncrasy, but I missed screaming at my Pixel to turn off the alarm. It&apos;s dumb, it&apos;s chaotic, but it&apos;s also fun. The fact that it confuses people hanging around you is an added bonus. It&apos;s a great conversation starter if anything. Every phone should have this feature.</p>
<h2 id="pure-unadulterated-stock-android-with-a-pixel-twist-2">Pure, unadulterated stock Android with a Pixel twist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hALmJJX8DMtGiHX894TjkM" name="pixel-8-29.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hALmJJX8DMtGiHX894TjkM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Android 12 Material You</a> facelift, Android on a Pixel is unmatched. The UI is mouth-wateringly delish to look at. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> has an even better look, and I absolutely love the look of my Pixel 8 running it.</p><p>Although One UI and dynamic color theming as well as themed icons, it just doesn&apos;t have the soul of a Pixel. The charm of the stock Android phone lies in the little things like the shape of the Quick Settings menu, the clock, the At a glance widget, and the fluid animations.</p><p>It&apos;s so easy to get used to the subtle software tweaks added by Google. I almost forgot that all phones don&apos;t have the ability to copy text from just about anywhere or translate text selected within an app without taking screenshots or any extra steps. Then there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, all of which deliver superior results.</p><p>Once you get used to Google&apos;s spin on stock Android, it&apos;s really hard to move on from there. Despite switching over to Samsung&apos;s better-functioning phone, I still yearned for these little built-in options and abilities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-makes-pixel-8-stand-out-among-other-android-phones">No one does cool, seamless software tweaks like Google does</a>.</p>
<h2 id="peak-android-photography-2">Peak Android photography</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa" name="Google-Pixel-8-new-camera-ui.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This section is extremely subjective, but I&apos;m the expert here so bear that in mind before bullying me in the comments section. I&apos;ve tested tons and tons of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, and when it comes to picture quality and color, Google is the undisputed champ.</p><p>Between the iPhone 15, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-google-pixel-8">Galaxy S24, and the Pixel 8</a>, the Pixel wins the battle when it comes to photography. Hand on my heart, the Pixel 8&apos;s camera is superior. I find the camera app to be more user-friendly, with easily findable and usable modes and just better photography overall.</p><p>I love the color tones and accuracy that the Pixel 8 delivers, with vibrant hues that are true to life. The level of detail is stunning, and the motion unblur kicks Samsung and Apple&apos;s butts. Night mode is phenomenal, too.</p><p>I&apos;m not here to persuade you that the Pixel 8 has the best cameras. Picture quality is subjective to the eye of the beholder. For me, Google has the right formula, but it might not be the same for you. However, this was a big feature that I craved when using the Samsung phone as my primary device. And it&apos;s not just my Pixel 8; my Pixel 6 could whoop the S22 Ultra with its hands tied behind its back. Photography is Google&apos;s forte, so if you ever ditch a Pixel, you&apos;ll miss the photography experience.</p>
<hr>
<p>This doesn&apos;t make up for the poor build quality and longevity of Pixels in general, nor does it negate my poor experience with the Pixel 6. However, these features are enough to make me want to give Google&apos;s Pixel ecosystem another shot. It makes me hope that the Pixel 8 doesn&apos;t walk down the Pixel 6&apos;s path, and though there&apos;s no way for me to confirm this right now, only time will tell whether newer Pixels are built to last.</p>

<ul><li>Google added support for 30 U.S. banks to the Google Wallet app in March, bringing the total number of supported banks to over 5,000.</li><li>The move follows roughly a hundred new banks that were added to Google Wallet in December and January.</li><li>Google's growing base of supported banks in Google Wallet comes as the company plans for a Google Pay shutdown in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Wallet is getting bolstered with new features each month as it becomes Google&apos;s primary digital banking and wallet app on Android. The company previously announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">Google Pay will officially be shut down</a> on June 4, 2024, at least in the U.S. Ahead of the forced transition, Google is making sure as many banks are supported in Google Wallet as possible. In March, that meant adding 30 new banks to the Google Wallet app in the U.S. </p><p>Google has made steady progress adding supported banks to the Google Wallet app in the U.S. It brought 42 new banking institutions on board in January, and 44 banks joined in December 2023. Now, as documented on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059326?co=GENIE.CountryCode%3DUS&sjid=12120385823364741247-AP#zippy=%2Cother-participating-banks" target="_blank">Google support page</a> and first discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-adds-30-new-supported-banks-us-march-2024/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, there are 30 more newcomers in the Google Wallet app. </p><p>Below is the full list of banks added to the Google Wallet app this month, including financial institutions from 14 different U.S. states. People who use these banks can now add digital bank cards to the Google Wallet app for Android. </p>
<ul><li>AtoB </li><li>Bank of Odessa (MO) </li><li>Beach Cities Commercial Bank (CA) </li><li>BFG Federal Credit Union (OH) </li><li>Chillicothe State Bank (MO) </li><li>Citizens Bank of Eldon (MO) </li><li>Coastlife Credit Union (TX) </li><li>Community Bank of Oelwein (IA) </li><li>CorePlus Federal Credit Union (CT) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants Bank (Cannon Falls, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (Fairmont, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (Luverne, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants State Bank (Brownsdale, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants State Bank of Grand Meadow (MN) </li><li>First National Bank of Le Center (MN) </li><li>First State Bank (OH) </li><li>Fortress Bank (IA) </li><li>Lusitania Savings Bank (NJ) </li><li>One Detroit Credit Union (MI) </li><li>Pacific Postal Credit Union (CA) </li><li>Pay by Extend </li><li>Ravalli County Federal Credit Union (MT) </li><li>Sidney State Bank (MI) </li><li>Sixth Avenue Baptist Federal Credit Union (AL) </li><li>SubZero / Avaya </li><li>The Bank of Star Valley (WY) </li><li>Waterfall Bank (FL) </li><li>Windward Bank </li><li>Xformative Payment Systems (NY)</li></ul>
<p>You&apos;ll notice immediately that many of these banks are smaller, and you might not have even heard of them before. In fact, six First Farmers & Merchants branches are included in the total of 30 new banks added to Google Wallet in March. That&apos;s partly because nearly all of the major U.S. banks are already supported by Google Wallet. In total, more than 5,000 banks in the U.S. work with Google Wallet. </p><p>Still, it&apos;s important for Google to continue working with smaller, local banks to get them into the Google Wallet. Not everyone uses a major bank, so getting these niche institutions onboard is key to making the Google Wallet ubiquitous among Android users. </p><p>Beyond bank cards, Google is actively adding support for new features in the Google Wallet app. It previously announced plans to add more supported U.S. state IDs this year. More recently, Google made it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-support-apple-wallet-file-format">use Apple Wallet passes in the Google Wallet app</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you are still a OnePlus 9 series or a OnePlus 8T user in the U.S., you may likely see a new OTA update on your device that brings the latest Android 14 version.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/t-mobile-oneplus-9-pro-9-8t-android-14-oxygenos-update-3427875/">Android Authority</a> notes that the company has started rolling out new updates to the OnePlus 9, OnePlus 9 Pro, and the OnePlus 8T in the U.S. These devices on the T-Mobile network will likely receive the OxygenOS 14 update soon, as some users already see the OTA updates.</p>
<p>Per the screenshots shared on Android Authority, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8t-review">OnePlus 8T</a> running on T-Mobile received the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a> update with <strong>KB2007_14.0.0.300(EX01)</strong> version, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-review">OnePlus 9</a> received the LE2117_14.0.0.212(EX01) firmware update. Both include the Android 14 update (codenamed Android OS U). Additionally, the update also brings the January 5, 2024 update, along with some general bug fixes.</p><p>As per the promise made by the company during the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 9 series launch, the OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 9, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-2022">OnePlus 9 Pro</a> will not be seeing the next Android version after the newest Android 14 update. However, security updates are likely to continue for a few more months.</p>

<p>While the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> version is currently seen on T-Mobile, the OnePlus 9 series, and the OnePlus 8T, the unlocked version of these handsets has already received the Android 14-based OxygenOS 14 in previous weeks, notes Android Authority.</p><p>Unlike the current lot, the previous OnePlus flagship models were promised limited Android version updates. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> was promised four Android versions and five security updates, and the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a> also followed the same update cycle as the predecessor model. </p><p>Overall, it is encouraging to see OnePlus keeping up to its promise and giving older OnePlus devices a fresh experience with the latest update rollout.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google released the second Android 15 Developer Preview this week, which means that a ton of new features and changes are being discovered. The big one is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">support for satellite connectivity</a>, but there are plenty of more under-the-radar additions. Namely, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a> is borrowing a fan-favorite feature from the OnePlus Open, known as "swipe up to continue."</p><p>As Android expert Mishaal Rahman first explained via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-fold-swipe-up-to-continue/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, Android 15 DP2 gives Pixel Fold owners a new default setting for how their smartphone will respond when the cover screen closes. Previously, if you closed the Pixel Fold&apos;s main screen, the cover screen would remain off unless you changed the default setting to <strong>always </strong>or <strong>only games, videos, and more</strong>. Still, there wasn&apos;t a way for Pixel Fold to selectively choose whether they wanted to continue using an app on the cover screen each time.</p><p>OnePlus had the idea of giving users the option of swiping up on the cover screen to continue using the app they just had open on the main screen. This lets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> users decide whether to continue using an app situationally rather than be locked into a default preference. Now, Google is following suit with the Android 15 Developer Preview 2. The <strong>only games, videos, and more</strong> option in the Pixel Fold settings app has been replaced with a <strong>swipe up to continue</strong> toggle. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 15 DP2 on the Pixel Fold has added the "swipe up to continue" screen lock feature I first reported was coming! This feature is ripped right from the OnePlus Open, and it lets you choose which apps to continue on the outer screen.https://t.co/9OUrieHgUJ<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1770912506820636774">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>That leaves Pixel Fold users with three possible default settings under the <strong>Continue using apps on fold </strong>page. <strong>Always</strong> will automatically turn on the front display when you close the Pixel Fold. <strong>Never</strong> automatically locks the Pixel Fold when you close it, every single time. </p><p>Google describes the new <strong>swipe up to continue</strong> as follows: "Fold your phone and swipe up on the front display to continue using the app, or wait a few seconds for the screen to lock."</p><p>Swipe up to continue was not present in Android 15 Developer Preview 1, and it was only added in the second release. It figures that Google will publicly release the feature to all Pixel Fold owners alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. However, it is confirmed to be working on Pixel Fold units running Android 15 DP 2. </p>

<ul><li>Google announced that in June 2024, it will remove all third-party apps and clock faces from the Fitbit app gallery in the EU.</li><li>This decision has impacted several of Fitbit's smartwatches but has left its fitness trackers and Google's Pixel Watches alone.</li><li>Users have until June 2024 to download and install any third-party content they'd like, and they will reportedly keep the files after the deadline passes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest announcement involves a major shift in the in-app content that EU folks will find for Fitbit watches by June 2024.</p><p>According to an updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237121?hl=en">support page</a>, Google will remove access to all third-party apps and clock faces from the Fitbit app gallery. The company adds that this decision was made to comply with new "regulatory requirements" set forth by the EU. </p><p>Users have until June 2024 to download and install any third-party apps and clock faces they&apos;d like on their Fitbit smartwatch.</p><p>This decision will impact the following Fitbit devices:</p>

<p>The support update adds that after the June 2024 deadline, users will only find Fitbit and Google-made apps and clock faces when searching for new content. It&apos;s important to know that this decision will not impact users in the U.S. or other countries.</p><p>Google recently confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-third-party-app-removal-3427913/">Android Authority</a> that any third-party content you&apos;ve downloaded will remain on your device after the given date.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google hasn&apos;t stated which new regulations have forced this change for countries in the European Union. It&apos;s not clear if this is a result of the EU&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA) or another agreement the company is forced to comply with.</p><p>The good news is the company has left Fitbit&apos;s range of trackers and its own Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> alone in the decision to remove third-party content. Additionally, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/google-fitbit-apps-faces-eu-removal/">9to5Google</a> noted, the Sense 2 and Versa 4 were already without third-party apps since launch. Those devices could only access third-party clock faces via the App Gallery, but even that is disappearing in just a few months.</p>

<ul><li>Further digging into Google's second Android 15 preview shows increased security efforts to protect devices connected via USB.</li><li>When attempting to switch USB modes, users will have to verify that it is them through various lock screen security methods.</li><li>Google detailed its second Android 15 preview yesterday (Mar. 21), offering insight into its satellite connectivity and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest Android 15 preview gives users better insight into how it will protect your files when connected via USB.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-15-change-usb-mode-authentication/">Android Police</a>), Android 15 Developer Preview 2 shows the software will require more "authentication" during USB-connected moments. To change which USB mode you&apos;re in, Rahm discovered users must verify it&apos;s truly them via lock screen measures such as their PIN, fingerprint, pattern, or password.</p><p>Such efforts will likely help give users peace of mind that nefarious actors can&apos;t connect their devices to a computer and rip all of their sensitive data. However, Rahman notes that there is a slight security flaw with this within the developer preview.</p><p>He states that if "Developer Options" is left enabled, someone could still access your phone&apos;s saved contents through "USB debugging." This would virtually "verify" them, enabling them to copy all of your content to another device.</p><p>Rahman suggests that users should leave their device&apos;s Developer Options disabled as a precaution until Google rectifies it.</p><p>In addition to transferring files, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> DP2 requires users to authenticate the USB mode switch if swapping to Webcam, MIDI, PTP, and USB tethering.</p>

<p>Google revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second Android 15 preview</a> yesterday (Mar. 21), and with it came another gaze into its satellite connectivity. The company is preparing to bring satellite connectivity for text messages and calls. Regarding the former, the preview showed Google&apos;s support for SMS/MMS and RCS apps to send <em>and </em>receive messages.</p><p>Another aspect of the preview involved upgrading the NFC experience for users, making Android&apos;s tap-to-pay feature smoother and more reliable. Android 15 was also seen supporting a range of apps for a foldable&apos;s cover display, meaning developers have more flexibility for the end user.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/the-second-developer-preview-of-android-15.html#:~:text=target%20Android%2015-,App%20compatibility,-To%20give%20you">its timeline</a>, Google is right on time with its second developer preview for Android 15. The next major software&apos;s open beta should begin next month in April, with its final release slated for sometime after July.</p>

<hr>
<p>A dive into the latest version of Google Messages showcases the inner workings of its integration with the AI model Gemini.</p><p>AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/First--Look-Google-Messages-Working-Gemini.html">TheSpAndroid</a>) discovered several activities and interactions users would soon find with Google&apos;s Gemini in Messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-google-messages-first-look-3427717/">Android Authority</a>). Found in version <strong>messages.android_20240318_00_RC00</strong>, the Gemini integration functions close to its web version as it includes Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bard-connects-to-google-apps-and-services">app extensions</a>. Internal code shows Messages will support Gmail, Flights, Maps, and other Workspace apps.</p><p>In a test, the AI bot was asked to display emails, and it reportedly displayed them accordingly. Moreover, when asked to "find something nearby," Gemini offered a list of local spots, citing Google Maps as its source.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> in Messages appears to have some image generation functionalities, but it&apos;s not as fleshed out as its web version. The post states Gemini will refuse images given to it if users have a question, but it <em>can </em>generate images based on a prompt. AssembleDeBug suspects Gemini&apos;s ability to respond based on text and photo prompts will be rectified later on.</p><p>Elsewhere, Gemini was spotted giving suggestions for coders. When asked to "write a bash script," Gemini responded appropriately but lacked the ability to copy it to the clipboard. Users must, instead, long-press the message to copy its contents.</p><p>AssembleDeBug was also able to add Gemini to a group chat. It was noted that doing so broke its E2EE (end-to-end encryption) and it didn&apos;t seem possible for the AI to respond in that setting.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s plans to implement Gemini into Messages was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-bard-in-messages-integration-discovered">early on in 2024</a>. Early discoveries showed the AI would let users ask it to draft text messages if they were calling in sick, ideas to motivate the team for presentations, and more. Even then, the AI detailed that chats with it were not encrypted, meaning users should refrain from inputting sensitive information.</p><p>The company likely made such a move in an attempt to save some data for training purposes for the AI.</p><p>Since then, Google has rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-you-to-text-gemini-in-google-messages">Gemini in Messages in beta</a> so users can chat with the AI. Users need to be signed into their account on Messages to utilize Gemini&apos;s abilities. The beta is only available for folks with a Pixel 6 or later, Pixel Fold, Samsung Galaxy S22 or later, and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip or Z Fold.</p><p>Once in, users can start a new chat with Gemini to begin texting with it much like you&apos;d do on a computer or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">in its app</a>. Google also previously stated image generation was disabled in its beta, however, the current preview suggests it might not remain that way on full release.</p>

<ul><li>The latest PSVR 2 headset firmware update enables a direct PC connection via the built-in USB-C cable for supported PCs.</li><li>Sony hasn't released a software driver yet, which means official support isn't quite ready.</li><li>The headset requires a unique 12V connection, meaning most PC users will need some kind of adapter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony regularly updates the PS5 and all its accessories, including headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a>. The latest firmware update includes a nifty hidden feature that will soon unlock direct PCVR usage when plugging a PSVR 2 into a supported PC, but there&apos;s a catch: you&apos;ll need a 12V USB-C port for it to work.</p><p>Sony&apos;s PSVR 2 hardware is designed similarly to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualLink">Nvidia VirtualLink</a>, a special VR-ready port used on the company&apos;s GeForce RTX 2000 series of graphics cards. Nvidia no longer outfits cards with this special port in the 3000 and 4000 generation, meaning only users with a GeForce RTX 2000 series card and a VirtualLink port might be able to directly connect a PSVR 2 and use it as a PC headset.</p><p>While this portion of the equation has been known for some time — you could use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/992490/iVRy_Driver_for_SteamVR/">iVRy software</a> on Steam for PSVR PC usage — the new firmware update makes it so PCs will no longer require some kind of workaround software solution to make the headset work.</p><p>Now, all we&apos;re waiting on is an official Windows driver, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/iVRy_VR/status/1770724715444809964?s=20">iVRy on X</a> (formerly Twitter). Once Sony has that driver ready for consumers, a PSVR 2 headset should be usable as a PCVR headset without any hacky workarounds.</p><p>The final part of the equation, of course, is how to get around that VirtualLink port requirement. It&apos;s surmised that Sony is developing an adapter similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-psvr-adapter-ps5">PSVR to PS5 adapter</a> that&apos;ll allow users to plug a PSVR 2 into it and then into a PC for easy wired PCVR use. Sony has become increasingly friendly about providing its games on Steam in recent years, so it&apos;s entirely likely that we&apos;ll see a final official solution soon.</p>
