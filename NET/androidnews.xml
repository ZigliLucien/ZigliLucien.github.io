This means it will become illegal for any app stores or web servers that host TikTok.</p><p>"We have given TikTok a clear choice," said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. </p><p>This move was taken after the U.S. government raised concerns about risks to national security and the data of users on the platform. A spokesperson from TikTok is calling this bill a "ban" and hopes that the Senate will consider facts before taking any action.</p><p>The bill is currently being considered by the Senate, and its fate remains uncertain until then. </p>

According to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">data from Counterpoint Research</a>, sales of the Galaxy S24 series rose by 8% in the first three weeks when compared to last year&apos;s early sales numbers, and the S24 Plus is driving up these numbers</p><p>"And in Samsung&apos;s biggest market – the US – we&apos;re seeing YoY growth in the mid-teens – solid numbers, especially considering the tough February. And considering we&apos;re still really at the beginning stages of the coming GenAI smartphone boom, there is plenty of runway for more growth," said Jeff Fieldhack, Counterpoint Research&apos;s research director for North America.</p><p>Over the years, Samsung&apos;s Plus model has been seen as nothing more than a larger version of the base model, complete with a larger battery and faster charging. The device did not offer much difference. However, this year&apos;s version has QHD+ resolution, offers better picture quality, bumps in RAM to 12GB, and, let&apos;s not forget the magic of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p>

Another way to do it is to head to the overflow menu, tap on Details or Group details, and look for the "Change colors" option just below the images and videos section. A full-screen preview UI will pop up, offering nine choices that include the default color, blue, purple, green, orange, and pink, among other options.</p><p>Once you choose a new color for a thread, a message pops up at the bottom of the screen saying, "You changed the theme."</p>

It makes sense because technology advances. But last week, it hit me right in the face, and I was honestly surprised.</p>

<p>In a very niche situation and in a very weird way, my laziness showed me just how great the camera on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> is.</p><p>I like aquariums; they keep me out of trouble. Mostly. Anyhoo, I was trying to sell some small pieces of coral online, and someone sent me a quick message about one particular piece. They asked me for a photo of it so they could see what they were thinking of buying.</p>
<p>Taking pictures of coral is really hard, even for a "professional" camera because of the lights used to make them grow. Corals need light of a certain wavelength and they can grow much like a plant, converting that light into energy. Our eyes don&apos;t see much of the light corals need, but it sure can mess with a camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2870px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pKkPS3pnTvDH2sGAMxgbNL" name="coral-bad.jpg" alt="Photo of coral ruined by weird lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pKkPS3pnTvDH2sGAMxgbNL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2870" height="1614" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A photo of coral taken with my Galaxy Z Flip 5. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That science fiction-looking photo came from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, and it&apos;s not useful because it looks nothing like what your eyes would see. Much (most) of the time, if you point your phone at an aquarium while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.iquaticsonline.co.uk/what-is-actinic-lighting/">actinic lights</a> are on, you get something similar. We can&apos;t see it, but a camera sensor gets overwhelmed by the huge amount of UV light pouring into the lens.</p><p>You offset it with UV lens filters, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KS3FYH5">this kit made for smartphones</a>. The science behind it is that the filters cut out light measuring 15k and 20k Kelvin (think super blue light that washes out everything else) while leaving the rest of the light data alone. The result is a photo that looks very much like what our eyes see without interference from all the UV.</p>
<p>Being too lazy to go and look for my little phone filter kit, I just pointed the Pixel 7 Pro at the aquarium and snapped a photo. To my surprise, I got this using Google&apos;s auto-settings.</p>

<p>That&apos;s still a strange photo, but it looks very much like what my eyes see. And it wouldn&apos;t have been possible just a few years back. Even cooler, it can also do the same thing with video.</p><p>I can take bunches of photos of my fish tank with the Pixel 7 Pro, but not all of them are useful. I can also get a useful photo from other phones once in a while, too. I&apos;ve played with it enough to confidently say that if you&apos;re taking a picture without any "white" light, Google has figured out some way to make it work through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-computational-photography">computational photography</a>.</p>
<p>While improved lenses play a part, the real magic lies in using software to "make" a picture. Smartphones leverage powerful processors and sophisticated software to enhance image quality beyond what the sensor can capture alone. Techniques like HDR (High Dynamic Range) combine multiple exposures for balanced lighting, while noise reduction algorithms eliminate graininess in low-light photos.</p><p>The result, in my case, isn&apos;t a great photo — it&apos;s grainy, there&apos;s a lot of noise, and you&apos;ll see strange artifacts where I need to clean the glass. But it&apos;s a good representation of what you see, takes the glow away from the background, and it&apos;s pretty consistent. </p>
<p>I have no idea what software magic is being used to turn light our eyes can&apos;t see into an accurate representation of what is real because, in this case, "real" changes so much. Adding some white lighting makes it easier to take a picture but slightly changes the colors you see because nothing is glowing like a black-light poster.</p>

<p>What I do know is that my year-old phone takes photos of a difficult subject as well or better than my expensive "real" camera that doesn&apos;t use voodoo logic and AI in place of a good, fast lens. I wish I had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> here to test because I know it did a lot better than expected while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">taking photos at a public aquarium</a>.</p><p>Phone cameras have moved past the "good enough" metric and are now a real professional tool. It&apos;s something I would have never thought could happen just a few years ago, but I&apos;m ready to put my bigger, heavier camera on the shelf.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As VR continues to grow in popularity, we&apos;re getting more games that try to replicate popular traditional games with the immersion and multiplayer experience that only VR can offer. Contractors Showdown is my latest VR gaming obsession as it channels two of the best battle royale titles on the market: Call of Duty Warzone, and PUBG.</p><p>Visually, the game evokes the look of PUBG in all the right ways. The map is absolutely massive, yet it doesn&apos;t feel like the developers had to cut down on model detail or make the map sparse just to fit on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. Even with this massive map, it supports 60 players at a time — that&apos;s three times the number supported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/population-one-winter-2023-update">Population: One</a>, the system&apos;s most popular battle royale game.</p><p>If you told me this scale of battle royale game would be on a standalone VR headset just a year or two ago, I&apos;m not sure I would have believed you.</p><p>Even the basic gameplay loop feels straight out of a PUBG match. You&apos;ll begin each round on a military dropship flying high over the island. As the bay doors open, you can choose to jump out at any time and pull your parachute to glide to your preferred starting point.</p><p>Weapons and support items are littered in clusters around the map, most commonly found in buildings or crates. Weapons all look and feel incredibly realistic, including unique reloading mechanics that feel good but are not overly complicated. It&apos;s a happy medium between the purposefully simple reloading mechanics in Population: One and some of the truly realistic — and often annoying — reloading mechanics in some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a>.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>If you told me this scale of battle royale game would be on a standalone VR headset just a year or two ago, I'm not sure I would have believed you.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The livestream above will give you a great idea of what to expect from the game, but I recommend starting at timestamp <strong>12:20</strong> to see how a round plays out from the beginning.</p><p>As the streamer makes his way to the edge of the plane and eventually jumps out, you&apos;ll get a feel and appreciation for just how <strong>massive</strong> this island is.</p><p>In many ways, this game brings the more realistic multiplayer shooter experience I had hoped to enjoy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ghosts-of-tabor-meta-quest-store-release">Ghosts of Tabor</a>. While that game is a masterclass in VR design, it requires more time and patience than I&apos;m willing to give.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wNWQtEVASGoer5WeUEYta4" name="contractors-showdown-screenshot-02.jpg" alt="An official screenshot of Contractors Showdown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wNWQtEVASGoer5WeUEYta4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Caveman Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Contractors Showdown fits right in between that game and Population: One, offering the opportunity to play with 60 players but not feel like you&apos;ve got no chance if you don&apos;t have dozens of hours to pour into the game every week.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The mechanics fit somewhere between realistic and accessible, while the perks and rewards system encourages players to keep coming back.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There are a few clunky parts right now, but I imagine those will continue to get ironed out as the game nears completion. On-body inventory is a bit confusing at first, but it only took me a few rounds to figure it out.</p><p>Likewise, the game&apos;s semi-complicated wearable computer system is a bit daunting at first but provides unique and interesting ways to offer perks and powers like air raids or drones during matches. Plus, the perk and upgrade system adds rewards for players who continue to come back, encouraging regular play sessions.</p><p>If you want to try it for yourself, the free open beta is running through March 17 (so there&apos;s not much time left at the time of writing). Sign up for it at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.contractorsvr.com/contractorsshowdown">Contractors Showdown website</a>.</p><p>We still don&apos;t know the final release date but I imagine it&apos;ll be landing in the next month or two based on my playtime with the game over the past few weeks. I&apos;m so happy to see more quality games like this land on the Meta Quest and can&apos;t wait to see what the final game plays like!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 aims to save storage space by archiving unused apps while preserving user data.</li><li>App archiving is a new feature expected to debut in Android 15's stable release, enabling users to free up device space without deleting apps entirely.</li><li>Archiving an app removes everything except the icon and code, simplifying restoration via Google Play.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The next version of Android is set to save storage space by moving unused apps aside while keeping your data safe, and now we&apos;re getting a sneak peek at how Android 15 might handle app archiving.</p><p>Last month, Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman gave us a heads-up about a new feature in the works: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-makes-auto-archiving-apps-available-to-everyone">app archiving</a>. This handy addition, likely coming to the stable release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, lets you reclaim space on your device without fully deleting apps.</p><p>Instead, when you archive an app, the operating system will strip away everything except for the app&apos;s icon and code. This allows you to easily restore the app via Google Play by simply tapping the icon, ensuring a seamless transition if you decide to install it again.</p><p>Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-app-archiving-demo-3425621/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, has now given us a detailed look at how the process will function. It appears that you&apos;ll be able to choose whether to archive apps manually as needed or have your phone automatically handle it. The whole system operates based on what Google refers to as archived APKs.</p><p>Rahman tried out app archiving with the Uber app on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Before archiving Uber, Mishaal notes, the app occupied 387MB of storage on his phone. Once archived, that space shrank to around 18MB—a significant reduction.</p>

<p>Yet, upon restoring the app, it&apos;s revealed that none of the app&apos;s data has been wiped out, and you don&apos;t need to log in again.</p><p>If you&apos;ve got a speedy internet connection, reinstalling an archived app should breeze through in just a few seconds. And once it&apos;s back, everything should be exactly as you left it when you archived it.</p><p>Currently, the feature is said to be a Google Play feature, but upon launch, it&apos;s anticipated to operate at the OS level. This implies that we can look forward to its debut as a feature of Android 15.</p>

<ul><li>A new wave of rumors suggests Samsung could deliver a third Galaxy Watch 7 later this year during Unpacked.</li><li>The second rumor doubles down on past speculation, which stated the Galaxy Watch 7 could utilize the 3nm process-based Exynos W940.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 series was previously rumored to have an "Ultra" model in the works, which could arrive in addition to or in replacement of its Pro model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims Samsung could release a third variant for its Galaxy Watch 7 later in 2024.</p><p>According to X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/kro_roe/status/1768266399821262981">Kro_Roe</a>, the Korean OEM is allegedly planning on launching a Galaxy Watch 7 Classic, Watch 7 Pro, and an unnamed third addition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/15/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-chip-three-variants-rumors/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster states the extra variant will be a "new one" in the machine-translated post, though nothing further was purported.</p><p>Another rumor states Samsung could provide a meaningful power boost to the Watch 7 series with a chipset upgrade.</p><p>Rumors stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1768414829004378195">TheGalox</a> on X, which states the Watch 7 could utilize Samsung&apos;s new Exynos W940 chip. They add the chip may offer a 50% boost in power efficiency alongside a potential 30% increase in speed.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exynos W940, the processor powering the Galaxy Watch7 series, will apparently be 50% more efficient and 30% faster than the previous model pic.twitter.com/XUFAe0c8ZA<a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1768414829004378195">March 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As far as the rumored third variant goes, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">rumored back in October</a> that Samsung could be developing a Watch 7 "Ultra." An Ultra model was speculated to arrive in addition to or in replacement of a Watch 7 Pro.</p><p>It was also stated that such a device could feature a MicroLED display. That display would provide a richer color experience, including better contrast, brightness, and energy efficiency compared to other LED products.</p><p>Meanwhile, this rumored Exynos W940 chip from Samsung was rumored last October, as well, suggesting it would be built on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-rumored-to-receive-3nm-exynos-chip">a 3nm process</a> instead of a 5nm. In addition to where the W940 could improve, it was previously stated the new chip could reduce its area by 35%. Consumers could be in for a slightly slimmer Galaxy Watch 7 if the rumors are true.</p><p>We&apos;re likely only a few months out from an official Watch 7 series reveal as Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">could take place</a> on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a new custom camera UI for Messages today (Mar. 15) that offers a streamlined, convenient approach for users.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/14/google-messages-new-camera/">9to5Google</a>, Messages&apos; new camera UI will reportedly replace your Android phone&apos;s default viewfinder. The new UI is also built off "Compose" and lets users pinch to zoom in or tap the three default zoom strengths above the shutter button.</p><p>Google is finally letting users switch between snapping photos and recording videos. Messages&apos; new UI features those options at the bottom, which should give users peace of mind, as they won&apos;t need to <em>launch </em>Messages&apos; camera in one mode or the other.</p>

<p>While the app&apos;s new viewfinder offers a bit of convenience, Google has seemingly removed an array of camera tools. The app&apos;s cog wheel, which expanded on your camera settings, is no longer present in this UI redesign. For some devices, tapping on this cogwheel lets you tinker with your camera flash, set a timer, or even alter your camera&apos;s aspect ratio.</p><p>For other devices, tapping the icon would open the system&apos;s default settings for its camera. Additionally, the redesigned viewfinder drops the grid overlay.</p><p>The publication speculates that this revamped UI could allow Google to pop in more features down the road. For now, Google Messages&apos; new camera UI is rolling out today (Mar. 15) as a server-side update. We haven&apos;t seen it appear just yet, meaning it&apos;s still making its rounds.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest camera rework in its messaging app comes two days after the company rolled out new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-messages-gets-new-emoji-reaction-effects">emoji reaction effects</a>. The effects are available for SMS and RCS chats and allow users to experience new animations when reacting to texts. The "dynamic twist" users will find only support a selection of 10 emojis. It&apos;s unclear if Google will add more to that list.</p>

<p>It appears that Google is working on bringing a new category system to Drive that should make it easier for users to find what they&apos;re looking for.</p><p>The feature was discovered by AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Google-Drive-File-Categories.html">TheSpAndroid</a>), and the post states that "Categories" will appear on the Drive app&apos;s home tab (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-drive-organization-files-storage/">Android Police</a>). Users may soon find their categories as rounded icons in a row at the top of the app&apos;s welcoming page. Moreover, a three-dot menu is said to let users "Manage Categories" for customization purposes.</p><p>In the app&apos;s code, tapping this option will let users decide which categories should appear quickly at the top. </p><p>Another finding shows that users can decide which "category" their documents and files should fall under. The app&apos;s code shows that tapping the three-dot menu on a document will soon include a second "Manage categories" option. From there, users should be able to select all categories that apply to their files.</p><p>There were twelve categories spotted in the Drive app&apos;s Android code:</p>
<ul><li>Auto</li><li>Banking</li><li>Expenses</li><li>Home</li><li>IDS</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Medical</li><li>Pets</li><li>School</li><li>Taxes</li><li>Travel</li><li>Work</li></ul>

<p>While the discovery was made in the Android app&apos;s code, AssembleDeBug states the feature will arrive on the web and iOS devices. Additionally, they speculate that personal and Workspace accounts should pick up categories whenever Google is finished.</p><p>While we await this new categorization method, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-video-playback-speed-boost">recently rolled out</a> an update to Drive that improves the playback experience of uploaded videos. The company&apos;s solution, which it calls "DASH," works to adjust the quality of your stored content depending on your network&apos;s speed. Google also detailed a refined search experience, which has only rolled out for iOS devices thus far.</p><p>New filters like File Type, Owner, and Last Modified should be available on Android, but Google has not said when.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Finding a cheap fitness tracker with reliable accuracy and all the key features you need is a challenge. On paper, the Garmin Forerunner 165 looks like a solid option that costs hundreds less than most Garmin watches. So after receiving my review unit, I set out to see how it compares against my two favorite cheap fitness trackers: The COROS PACE 3 and Fitbit Charge 6.</p><p>First, I walked 5,000 steps and ran 1,000 steps wearing all three devices, while counting my steps with a manual pedometer. Then I ran five miles to test their GPS accuracy, while also wearing a Polar H10 chest strap to judge their heart rate accuracy. Lastly, I finished off with a sprint workout on a local track to double-check GPS and heart rate accuracy in more vigorous conditions. </p><p>Here are the results, comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-delivers-absurd-value-for-frugal-serious-runners">Garmin Forerunner 165</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> for accuracy!</p>
<h2 id="step-accuracy-2">Step accuracy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-step-test-with-Fitbit-Charge-6-and-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer held in hand with the number 5,000, a Garmin Forerunner 165 (5,062 steps), and a Fitbit Charge 6 (4,812 steps)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I did my original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">step-tracking accuracy test</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> beat the other brands, with the flagship COROS watch coming in third and the Fitbit Sense coming in last for accuracy. But I wasn&apos;t sure if Garmin&apos;s advantage would persist with a watch model that costs $200 less. </p><p>I wrote down the incidental steps for all three watches outside my front door, then tracked 5,000 steps of walking while counting every step with a pedometer. I then ran another 1,000 steps while counting, to see if the accuracy changed. After that, I stopped tracking each step, but I still wrote down my final step count for each fitness tracker, to see how far apart they were. </p>

<p>Interestingly, my results mirrored my last test: Garmin did exceptionally well at avoiding false-positive steps at just 11 over estimate, compared to 14 last time. COROS over-estimated my count my 84, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">APEX 2 Pro</a> was 70 steps off. And once again, Fitbit significantly undercounted my steps: 199 off this time, 284 off last time. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="U4MdV6vQFG9cmcSetZ2xGK" name="COROS-PACE-3-step-test-with-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer showing "6,000" and a COROS PACE 3 worn on a wrist with the step count 6,102." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4MdV6vQFG9cmcSetZ2xGK.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While tracking running, Fitbit and COROS did much better, which makes sense because the accelerometer can detect larger motions more easily. Garmin still won for accuracy, though it did better on average for walking. </p><p>I can&apos;t tell you my actual step count for the day, but I&apos;m inclined to believe that Garmin&apos;s number remained the most accurate. If we assume that, then COROS&apos; count (143 short) is within a reasonable margin of error for such a long distance, whereas Fitbit (794 short) is less forgiveably erroneous. </p>
<h2 id="heart-rate-accuracy-2">Heart rate accuracy</h2>
<p>I wore the Polar H10 chest strap, one of the most popular and respected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-heart-rate-monitor-straps-garmin-fitbit">heart rate monitors</a> out there, to see how the Garmin Forerunner 165 compared to it in accuracy and responsiveness. </p><p>For my first five-mile run, only the Forerunner 165 matched the Polar H10 for average heart rate at 158 bpm, while the Fitbit Charge 6 and COROS PACE 3 came close at 157 bpm. The same goes for minimum heart rate, with Garmin and Polar showing 96 bpm while COROS and Fitbit listed 95 bpm. As for the maximum, both Garmin and COROS registered a max heart rate of 176, while Polar only hit 175 and Fitbit topped at 174. </p>

<p>The heart rate chart above shows how the Garmin Forerunner 165 and Polar H10 compare directly. As with any wrist-based optical HRM, the Forerunner 165 lags slightly behind the chest strap, climbing at a slower pace and keeping the same heart rate readings after the H10 has already begun to dip back down. </p><p>For the most part, the Forerunner 165 remained within 1–2 bpm of the chest strap at all times, and usually corrected itself fairly quickly. It explains why they ended up with the same average, despite the differences. That said, it did seem to struggle a bit in one context: on hills, it would climb up to the right reading fairly quickly but lag in terms of dropping back down on the downhills. </p>

<p>Looking at the other two comparison charts, it&apos;s difficult to say if COROS or Fitbit are necessarily better or worse. Both brands consistently underreported their heart rates by about 1 bpm, which is annoying. However, they didn&apos;t have quite as much difficulty adjusting to quick heart rate changes. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gLhvgmgqRrEA5ebrRxXpAk" name="COROS-PACE-3-HR-vs-Polar-H10.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and COROS PACE 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLhvgmgqRrEA5ebrRxXpAk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2277" height="1281" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The COROS PACE 3 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a five-mile run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We know Fitbit has Google&apos;s HR algorithm to thank for that, while COROS just did a good job on its own. </p><p>Moving on to the results for my track sprint workout, it&apos;s more difficult to determine accuracy because my Polar H10 had bizarrely deflated results for about 15 seconds early on (as seen in the graph above). So, while the Forerunner 165 and Charge 6 (173 bpm) were higher than the H10 and PACE 3 (172 bpm), I think Garmin and Fitbit might be on point this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Garmin Forerunner 165 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1880" height="1058" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Forerunner 165 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That part aside, the Forerunner 165 was once again close but always lagging slightly behind the chest strap as I switched from sprints to jogs and back. It averages out well enough in my mind, but if you&apos;re someone fixated on exact specs, you might not be fully satisfied.</p>

<p>Looking at the competing options, the Fitbit Charge 6 impressed me. The chart shows how it reacts almost in lockstep with the Polar H10 to changing heart rate data. It did read slightly low in most cases, but this could be in part because I was wearing it higher up my wrist than normal to make room for the Forerunner 165. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1865px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NBvb6rEzZHBWSSjU4XX49j" name="COROS-PACE-3-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and COROS PACE 3 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBvb6rEzZHBWSSjU4XX49j.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1865" height="1049" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The COROS PACE 3 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The PACE 3 did adequately enough, but had more issues than the Forerunner 165 with lagging data. There are a few major discrepancies where it rose higher than it should have, or failed to rise at all. That said, it did hit a very reasonable average HR, so I wouldn&apos;t be too disappointed with the results. </p>
<h2 id="gps-accuracy-2">GPS accuracy</h2>
<p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 doesn&apos;t have the dual-frequency GPS tracking of the more expensive Forerunners, but it does have an "All-Systems mode" that pulls from GPS and another satellite system like GLONASS or GALILEO simultaneously for better results. Meanwhile, the COROS PACE 3 does have top-tier dual-band tracking, while the Fitbit Charge 6 only uses GPS or GLONASS individually, with some help from your smartphone GPS if you use "Dynamic GPS" mode. </p><p>Also, COROS and Garmin gave their respective running watches an altimeter to judge elevation, something the Fitbit Charge 6 lacks — so it estimates based on GPS data. </p>

<p>Garmin and COROS were relatively close to one another, while Fitbit&apos;s GPS-only results seemed to overestimate how far I&apos;d run and my pace as a result. That <em>especially</em> applies to my elevation gain: My route had hills, but Fitbit&apos;s estimate really exaggerated how high they were. </p><p>Looking at the actual GPS satellite map, the Fitbit Charge 6 was predictably inaccurate, straying wildly off the path. So, I focused instead on the two watches that I could actually count upon to be reasonably accurate: the Forerunner 165 and COROS PACE 3. In the screenshots below, Garmin&apos;s path is pink, while COROS&apos; route is orange. </p>

<p>In each case, Garmin "won" the accuracy battle. I generally stayed on the right side of the path in both directions. In Garmin&apos;s measurement, it showed me closer to the middle in both directions, while COROS consistently showed me running in the grass and dirt alongside the path. </p><p>Does this matter? Given the similar overall distance, it&apos;s hard to say. If GPS inaccuracy of any kind frustrates you, you&apos;ll want to look at a more expensive, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">higher-end Garmin watch</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> or higher. I&apos;m personally satisfied that these results are trustworthy compared to GPS-only watches. </p>

<p>Turning to my track workout, I ran my four laps entirely in the third lane so I could compare the watches&apos; fidelity in satellite view. Garmin, COROS, and Fitbit have pink, orange, and blue lines, respectively. </p><p>With the Garmin Forerunner 165, the watch would show me in the second or third lane on curves and the beginning of straightaways, then drift closer to the inner lanes over time. I suspect this was the watch filling in gaps in coverage, pulling my actual location to the left because I would eventually turn left. The tracked distance was exactly right at 1,660 meters, but that&apos;s probably because I marked myself as in the third lane in the pre-activity settings. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="W7QrcqZzJa2BDeCCoaXJn7" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-fitbit-charge-6-coros-pace-3-gps-track-test-2.jpeg" alt="A satellite map of a track, showing the author's location while wearing the COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7QrcqZzJa2BDeCCoaXJn7.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2406" height="1353" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>COROS&apos; track results mirrored what I noted in my original PACE 3 review: They&apos;re not as accurate as expected. My GPS map showed me way off in the right-side lanes for most of the run and cutting across the inner track on one of the turns. Even though its 1,658-meter result was accurate, that&apos;s (again) because COROS has a Track Run activity that lets you set a lane. </p><p>On the other hand, at least the PACE 3 and Forerunner 165 were <em>consistent</em> in their slight inaccuracies. The Fitbit Charge 6 wavered wildly across lanes as if I was purposefully doing sidesteps (or slightly drunk). The distance (1,625 meters) was more noticeably off, even after I forgot to turn it off and walked off the track to cool down. The GPS-only tracking and the lack of a Track Run activity mode hurt Fitbit&apos;s ability to compete, here. </p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 deserves its place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> for frugal runners, right alongside the COROS PACE 3 and Fitbit Charge 6. Each has its respective strengths, however.</p><p>The Fitbit Charge 6 has reliable heart rate results and does more with that data. Garmin and COROS do support HRV data for stress and recovery, but only the Charge 6 measures AFib both actively and passively, along with skin temperature. It&apos;s the lightest and cheapest watch of the three — though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a> will close the gap after the 6-month free trial and one annual subscription — and has a few Google app perks you&apos;ll appreciate, like Maps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Wallet</a>.</p><p>The COROS PACE 3 has a fantastic 24-day battery life, 38-hour GPS, and 15-hour dual-frequency GPS, crushing the 7-day Charge 6 and the 11-day Forerunner 165. The trade-off is its dull MIP display, which makes it less enjoyable to look at in non-fitness contexts. What matters more for runners is that it gets the full extent of COROS&apos; training analysis, like Training Load and Status, while the Forerunner 165 is artificially restricted from certain metrics to upsell you to the 265. </p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 won for step and GPS location accuracy, despite not having the most accurate satellite tech that Garmin offers. It also held its own for HR accuracy, even if it could have been better. I simply wish that Garmin had given the Forerunner 165 the Training Load metric. I can make do without Training Status or Readiness, but it&apos;s hard not knowing whether you&apos;re staying consistent on activity level compared to past weeks.</p><p>Overall, I&apos;m really happy with the results for my three favorite fitness trackers, and feel comfortable recommending the Forerunner 165 if you can make do without the upgrades that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> or 265 offers.  </p>
