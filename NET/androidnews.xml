<hr>
<p>As we near the launch of the Xperia 1 VI flagship smartphone from Sony, we are starting to see more and more prominent leaks of the handset as new marketing images pop up — thanks to Evan Blass.</p><p>Blass took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the official images of the Xperia 1 VI, which showcase the device in almost all angles. Per the marketing renders, the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship</a> from Sony is incorporating a textured finish on the back and also across the middle frame.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">X1mVI pic.twitter.com/sZRPlWT8ZL<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1786907825823703471">May 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The rear also includes a triple camera setup (based on ZEISS), which is the specs uncovered last week in a new leak. It contains an ultra-wide-angle camera, a wide-angle primary camera, and a periscopic lens. The primary lens in the setup is Sony&apos;s "Exmor T for mobile" lens.</p><p>On the front, unlike other prominent flagships, Sony opts for a minimal bezel display that hides the selfie shooter up top instead of opting for a conventional punch hole cutout. </p><p>The new promotional images further hint that the display is powered by the company&apos;s proprietary BRAVIA engine. They indicate that a decent 5000mAh battery capacity will power the device, which will support wireless and reverse wireless charging.</p><p>Besides, the images from Blass also show the Xperia 1 VI&apos;s emphasis on audio playback as it beholds the good old 3.5mm headphone jack coupled with Hi-Res audio wireless audio certification (also for wireless) next to 360-degree realty audio, LDAC support, and DSEE Ultimate AI-based tech to upscale "more hi-quality to your compressed music."</p>

<ul><li>Epic won an antitrust case against Google in a shocking jury verdict at the end of last year, and now Google and Epic both have the chance to tell the courts how they'd like to move forward.</li><li>Unsurprisingly, Epic announced an exhaustive lists of demands that would blow the Google Play Store right open.</li><li>Now, Google has countered with a statement and isn't happy with Epic's proposals.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic has been on a years-long quest to avoid paying fees on mobile platforms and gain the unabridged right to offer alternative payment methods for in-app purchases. Though the company largely lost its lawsuit against Apple, the opposite happened in its case against Google. In an unexpected jury verdict in December 2023, it was determined that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">Google has a monopoly on app distribution</a> on Android. So, what comes next?</p><p>Though Epic won its case, the situation is far from over. First, Epic had to tell the court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-wants-google-play-store-open">what it wanted a resolution to look like</a>. Then, Google had a chance to respond by May 2 with its own filing, and the company did so last week. Later this month, a hearing scheduled for May 23 will see each side make their case in front of a judge with expert testimonies. A final decision from the court is certain to come later than that. </p><p>Google still plans to challenge the original verdict, but its latest court filing tells us what it thinks about Epic&apos;s demands. In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/google-dubs-epics-demands-from-its-antitrust-win-unnecessary-and-far-beyond-the-scope-of-verdict/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, Google&apos;s vice president of Government Affairs & Public Policy, Wilson White, called Epic&apos;s asks "unnecessary" and "far beyond the scope of the recent U.S. trial verdict."</p><p>While Epic did win the case, the court&apos;s opinion on the injunctions filed by Epic and Google will determine what the game developer <em>actually</em> won. The positions held by both companies are entirely expected, and it&apos;s doubtful that either Epic and Google think that the courts will completely side with them. What will likely happen is that presiding Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California will find a middle ground between the two companies. </p>
<h2 id="what-epic-asked-for-and-why-it-makes-sense-2">What Epic asked for, and why it makes sense</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rbQUuynpzxvtDQcTXhPEUn" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-gaming-razer-kishi-v2-fortnite.jpg" alt="Playing Fortnite on a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra using a Razer Kishi V2 controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbQUuynpzxvtDQcTXhPEUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The changes that Epic wants to see on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a> are far-reaching and would create a completely different environment than the one we see today. It might be easy to laugh at Epic&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epics-remedy-following-google-case-jury-verdict" target="_blank">proposed remedy</a>, but it makes complete sense. In a negotiation, you always ask for more than you think you&apos;ll get. That way, when concessions are made, you&apos;ll end up with more than you would have if you started out at what might be considered more reasonable and fair. </p><p>Of course, Epic could also end up getting everything it asked for. After all, few experts and analysts expected Epic to come away with a victory against Google in the first place. If you&apos;re at the helm of Epic, why not try for absolutely everything you can and see what you come away with? </p><p>A high-level overview of what Epic is asking for is complete parity between the experience of downloading apps through the first-party Google Play Store, third-party app marketplaces, and sideloading. There&apos;s a full 16 pages of demands, but it all boils down to that central point.</p><p>Epic wants Google to remove Android warnings that push users away from downloading apps from alternate sources and cease exclusivity deals with developers. It also wants to bar Google from offering exclusive features that other developers can&apos;t, like integration with Google products and services.</p>
<h2 id="google-apos-s-rebuttal-isn-apos-t-wrong-either-2">Google&apos;s rebuttal isn&apos;t wrong, either</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also can&apos;t blame Google for countering with its alternative viewpoint, which appears to be a bit more fair than Epic&apos;s, although that&apos;s all up to interpretation. </p><p>"Epic&apos;s demands would harm the privacy, security, and overall experience of consumers, developers, and device manufacturers," said White, on behalf of Google, in a statement.</p><p> "Not only does their proposal go far beyond the scope of the recent U.S. trial verdict — which we will be challenging — it&apos;s also unnecessary due to the settlement we reached last year with state attorneys general from every state and multiple territories," he continued.</p><p>"We will continue to vigorously defend our right to a sustainable business model that enables us to keep people safe, partner with developers to innovate and grow their businesses, and maintain a thriving Android ecosystem for everyone."</p><p>Google tells the court in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/myvmkzlyyvr/Google%20objections%20to%20Epic%20-%2020240502.pdf">filing</a> that Epic&apos;s proposed changes, specifically around third-party app stores, would limit its ability to protect users&apos; privacy and security. Additionally, it says that Epic&apos;s asks would force it to tell third-party app marketplaces the list of apps users have already installed, potentially putting users in a compromising position. This could be devastating for users since governments in the U.S. are already using users&apos; installed apps to investigate or prosecute them.</p><p>Finally, Google argues that some of Epic&apos;s demands are redundant due to a previous settlement the company made in a case with some U.S. state attorneys general. This deal eliminates expansive Google Play Store exclusivity deals but still gives Google the opportunity to make smaller exclusivity agreements within apps. Google says Epic&apos;s ask to remove exclusivity deals altogether would limit developer opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-final-ruling-look-like-2">What does a final ruling look like?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y5gPxJ4PEi9iLuC7vkPEU4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Book-3-Ultra-playing-fortnite.jpg" alt="Playing Fortnite on a Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5gPxJ4PEi9iLuC7vkPEU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Epic and Google are clearly at odds, and that&apos;s to be expected. After a review process, Judge Donato will likely create a final verdict that differs from both companies&apos; proposed injunctions. We don&apos;t know what that might look like right now, but we may get a better idea following the May 23 hearing, where both sides will make their cases. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="5vkVkJTK62sYNBWrJ7cGgG" name="Epic-Games-Store-Mobile.jpg" alt="The Epic Games store on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vkVkJTK62sYNBWrJ7cGgG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Epic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We do know that however the result shakes out, Epic is pushing alternative app marketplaces on Android. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">Epic Games Store is coming to Android</a> later this year, regardless of the verdict in this case. However, if the court sides with Epic more than Google, the Epic Games Store might have a better chance to compete with the Google Play Store.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Developers using Google Fit APIs need to switch to Health Connect by June 30, 2025.</li><li>Google has ceased accepting new sign-ups for Google Fit API access, urging developers to transition to Health Connect.</li><li>The deprecation has caused concern among developers, particularly because there's no direct replacement for the Goals API, which is used for setting daily activity targets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Apps that track your fitness with Google Fit will need an upgrade by next summer, as Google is moving to a new system called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>.</p><p>Google effectively began phasing out Fit&apos;s developer APIs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/health-connect-platform-google-samsung">launch of Health Connect in 2022</a>. Google Fit used to be the primary health platform until the company started transitioning to Health Connect, also referred to as the Android Health platform.</p><p>Google announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/evolving-health-on-android-migrating-from-google-fit-apis-to-android-health.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> that it is giving developers until June 30, 2025, to switch over to Health Connect (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/04/google-fit-api-shutdown/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The Google Fit APIs, including the REST API, will be available until that date, "giving developers ample time to migrate to Android Health."</p><p>This means that Google is no longer accepting new sign-ups for API access. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-apps-android">Fitness and workout apps</a> that used to rely on Google Fit now need to switch to Health Connect before the deadline.</p><p>Google&apos;s move to phase out the Fit APIs has sparked concerns among developers. Although Google has provided a transition guide, it hasn&apos;t introduced a substitute for the Goals API, which lets users set daily goals for steps and heart points.</p><p>Google I/O <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">is just around the corner</a> (it starts May 14), and health is a hot topic. With the company phasing out Google Fit APIs in favor of Health Connect, we can definitely expect to hear more about how it envisions the future of health and fitness within its ecosystem of devices and apps.</p><p>That said, it&apos;s unclear what&apos;s next for the Google Fit app itself on Android, Wear OS, and iOS. For now, the apps seem to keep working as activity trackers and data holders on those platforms.</p><p>Interestingly, the Google Fit app hasn&apos;t seen any significant updates lately. The last big update was just adding Health Connect support back in 2022. This adds to the mystery surrounding the app&apos;s future.</p><p>With Google Fit APIs going away and the Fitbit app being the default health app on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>, it certainly looks like Google sees Fitbit as its main player for health tracking. A single, unified system through Fitbit would definitely simplify things for the tech giant.</p>

It has a gorgeous design, delivers incredible performance, has a large battery that lasts up to two days consistently, and you get a bright AMOLED panel that goes up to 4,500 nits. </p><p>But its the cameras that ultimately make it stand out, and it is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phone</a> available at the moment. But if you&apos;re not interested in this year&apos;s phone and are looking to wait it out until 2025, then the OnePlus 13 should be of interest. </p><p>We haven&apos;t heard much about the OnePlus 13 just yet other than an initial design leak, and as these things usually go, it may not be the real deal. That should change over the coming months, but for now, this is what we know about the OnePlus 13. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-price-and-release-date"><span>OnePlus 13: Price and release date</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gMuCtRi9rxN9HcNhK6vFNG" name="oneplus-12-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 home screen against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMuCtRi9rxN9HcNhK6vFNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus followed the same launch pattern over the last two years, releasing its flagship in China in the month of December, and making it available in global markets — usually with a glitzy launch event in India — in the month of January. </p><p>The OnePlus 12 debuted on January 23, and I&apos;m estimating a similar cadence with the OnePlus 13. This strategy allows OnePlus to be one of the first to roll out phones featuring Qualcomm&apos;s latest silicon, and it lets the manufacturer get an edge over Samsung and Xiaomi. Even though Xiaomi launched the Xiaomi 14 series earlier, the global launch isn&apos;t going to be until the end of Q1. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-design-and-screen"><span>OnePlus 13: Design and screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK" name="oneplus-12-31.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 next to OnePlus 9, OnePlus 10, and OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used the same design aesthetic on its devices for a while now, and that&apos;s a good thing. While the camera housing is tweaked with every generation, the smooth curves and rounded edges have been a mainstay on OnePlus phones for the better part of a decade. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1201px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.78%;"><img id="e8EafuVjzmvSN8zBmrZgFc" name="op13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 design leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8EafuVjzmvSN8zBmrZgFc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1201" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it looks like the manufacturer is set to roll out a new design with the OnePlus 13, at least according to a new leak that is making the rounds on Weibo. The leak suggests the back of the OnePlus 13 will use a rectangular camera island that looks very similar to the OnePlus 9. It will be interesting to see if the device actually ends up looking like that, and I&apos;m not so sure that will be the case. </p>
<p>OnePlus switched from Samsung to BOE for the screen, and it allowed the manufacturer to use a significantly brighter 4,500-nit brightness panel on the OnePlus 12. Given the gains on offer, the OnePlus 13 is likely to use a BOE screen as well, and it may go even higher. Initial leaks suggest the device will use a 6.8-inch panel, similar to this year. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-specs"><span>OnePlus 13: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U5MtwmSr9qimjcqt7e6jvE" name="oneplus-12-3.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U5MtwmSr9qimjcqt7e6jvE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s pretty straightforward to guess what sort of hardware the OnePlus 13 may have to offer. It will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, feature at least 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and OnePlus may launch a 1TB model globally next year. </p><p>While there is a 1TB version of the OnePlus 12, it is limited to China, and OnePlus could just wait a year and launch the higher-storage model with the OnePlus 13 instead. This is consistent with what the company did in the past. </p><p>Elsewhere, I don&apos;t see any changes coming to the 100W charging tech, and the battery should be the same 5,400mAh unit that we got this year. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-cameras"><span>OnePlus 13: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfPqPpn49uJuEm37hjAqQF" name="oneplus-12-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 camera island with Hasselblad logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfPqPpn49uJuEm37hjAqQF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 12 introduced a set of new sensors, allowing it to take much better photos than any other OnePlus phone to date. This is set to continue next year, and while I don&apos;t have any details to share at this point, it is likely that the OnePlus 13 will have better telephoto lenses and a new main camera module that has increased light sensitivity. </p><p>What I want to see is a new selfie camera that can take good photos and videos. This is the biggest shortcoming on the OnePlus 12, and I want to see the manufacturer address this with the OnePlus 13. If I had to guess, the device will pick up a similar set of sensors as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and that should make things very interesting. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE" name="oneplus-12-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, there&apos;s very little we know about the OnePlus 13 at this point. But if history is any indication, it shouldn&apos;t be too long before we start getting leaks, and I&apos;ll be continually updating the post as new information about the device emerges. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve always been a fan of the iPad, and in the last four years, I used several iterations of the iPad Air extensively. My use case centers around reading, taking notes, and streaming videos occasionally, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-air-m1-long-term-review">iPad Air M1</a> manages to do these things incredibly well.</p><p>At the start of last year, I wanted a portable device that would allow me to be productive on the go, and while the 10.9-inch panel on the iPad Air was decent enough, I needed something larger, so I switched to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At the outset, I didn&apos;t think there would be a lot of difference between the two other than the larger screen; both models have powerful hardware, a similar design, and the same software.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="urkHw7qWSwSA27StWDyuBi" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-5.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/urkHw7qWSwSA27StWDyuBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I was wrong. The iPad Pro 12.9 is noticeably better than the iPad Air; the mini-LED panel gets brighter and has much better contrast, and HDR content looks amazing on the device. While I didn&apos;t pay attention to this at the time, the quad speakers on the iPad Pro sound much better.</p><p>The biggest difference is the screen refresh, with the iPad Pro getting ProMotion tech that allows it to go up to 120Hz. The iPad Air is limited to 60Hz, and it is immediately evident when using both devices next to each other. And because of the larger size, there&apos;s a bigger battery that lasts noticeably longer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5MuFXmLBtHyikTJbpk57Ni" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-6.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5MuFXmLBtHyikTJbpk57Ni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main reason for using the iPad Pro is for productivity, and it has been terrific in that regard. For most of the last decade, I followed the same schedule: get up at 6am, finish the day&apos;s writing tasks, and then get started with my day. That isn&apos;t the case now; my wife and I had a baby last year, and I write whenever I find the time — my ten-month-old dictates my schedule.</p><p>So I had to learn to do something I&apos;m not very good at: flexibility. I couldn&apos;t just lock myself away in my home office and write for hours on end, so I needed something portable. I have a lot of Windows machines, but I wanted something that had a touchscreen and a modular design with plenty of accessories, and that led me to the iPad Pro.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sfHNhhf5La9GEBH2ENWYVi" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-8.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sfHNhhf5La9GEBH2ENWYVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the last 10 months, a full 40% of my writing was done on the iPad Pro, and I didn&apos;t think I would use the device anywhere as much. The screen is the ideal size — it&apos;s almost the same size as most 13-inch notebooks — and as it has Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, I was able to add a docking station and connect my mechanical keyboard without any hassle.</p><p>But a big part of why I used the iPad Pro to the extent I did was the Magic Keyboard; the $349 keyboard accessory costs more than most mechanical keyboards, but it is terrific. It attaches securely, has good adjustability, and the keyboard itself is decent; the scissor keys have 1mm travel and are backlit, and they&apos;ve held up well after nearly a year of use. The trackpad also comes in handy, and it&apos;s just easier to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LL2NwL69AKSTZAGFDWehui" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-17.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LL2NwL69AKSTZAGFDWehui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, the iPad Pro 12.9 is ideally suited for my use case. While iPadOS doesn&apos;t have anywhere close to the productivity features that are available in macOS, that hasn&apos;t been an issue — multitasking isn&apos;t something I&apos;m looking for in a portable machine. For the tasks I do daily — writing, editing photos, and reading — the iPad Pro is a stellar option. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> have similar hardware, but most of these options are limited to Samsung, and while I tolerate One UI on phones, I don&apos;t have any intention of using it on a larger device. </p><p>There were weeks when I used the iPad Pro exclusively, and the only issue in doing so was the convoluted file access within iPadOS; other than that, it proved to be a reliable powerhouse. The Magic Keyboard in particular unlocks the full potential of the iPad Pro, but the only quibble with it is that the fabric design doesn&apos;t quite match up to its premium asking price. Thankfully, it looks like that&apos;s going to change with the 2024 iteration of the iPad Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qi9dBKgZ36vQhoTe2Lmiei" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-16.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qi9dBKgZ36vQhoTe2Lmiei.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this is a secondary consideration, the iPad Pro is great for creative use cases. There&apos;s no analog to Procreate on Android or Windows, and the drawing utility is incredible. I dabble in music production, and iPadOS has an extensive collection of synths and drum machines, and the larger screen definitely makes a difference in this regard — as does the ability to connect accessories.</p><p>With new iPads inbound, I&apos;m excited to see what&apos;s in store this year. The switch to OLED panels and better software features should give the upcoming iPad Pro a distinct advantage over the MacBook, and I can&apos;t wait to see how the series evolves.</p>

<p>In an age where fitness watches and smart rings use passive health data and hidden algorithms to judge your health and athleticism, Polar takes a direct user approach. The Vantage V3 has a dedicated section for "Tests" on everything from nightly recovery and ECGs to VO2 Max. And while automatic tracking is more futuristic, I&apos;m a fan of this alternative.</p><p>The annoying part of buying any new smartwatch is the learning period. You&apos;re promised the equivalent of a constant doctor&apos;s physical and a PE test on your wrist. But once you put it on, you&apos;ll wear it for days, if not weeks, before the software will share its findings or properly gauge your health and fitness level. </p><p>Blame my inability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">sleep soundly while wearing a smartwatch</a> or the fact that this job makes me switch watches every few weeks, but it&apos;s difficult for me to sustain interest in a new product long enough to take advantage of these features or remember to seek out the information once it&apos;s finally ready. </p><p>On the fitness side, I can&apos;t tell you how often VO2 Max data on a smartwatch is woefully incorrect from the start, based on run data that couldn&apos;t possibly provide the insight necessary to make that kind of judgment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="odZYj8gmDnysxUmGUH2mzM" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-cardio-load-status.jpeg" alt="A Cardio Load Status screen of "Overreaching" on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/odZYj8gmDnysxUmGUH2mzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar isn&apos;t so different from these other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands in that it&apos;ll also measure your VO2 Max, nightly recharge, and other data passively over time. But it also lets you take that into your own hands, so to speak, with its active testing section. </p><p>I can look at my "Cardio Load Status" to see whether Polar&apos;s algorithm thinks I&apos;m ready to work out or "overreaching" based on my abilities. But if the estimate doesn&apos;t match my <em>perceived</em> energy level, Polar has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.polar.com/e_manuals/vantage-v/polar-vantage-v-user-manual-english/content/orthostatic-test.htm" target="_blank">orthostatic test</a> that takes a snapshot of my heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) at rest or while standing.</p><p>A full night of HRV data will give Polar more data to work with. But if you don&apos;t sleep with your Polar or wear a different tracker to bed (like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>), this gives you the info necessary for a judgment call after four minutes of relaxation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-orthostatic-test-result.jpeg" alt=""Test result: your cardio system is recovered" screen on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Despite "Overreaching" on my training, my orthostatic test found that my body isn't as tired as the algorithm thinks.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even better, Polar has a "leg stiffness" test that measures your muscular recovery after runs. </p><p>Every post-run marathoner knows the feeling when their heart has recovered but their legs need another week. Other times, my legs feel fine, but my worn-down heart treats a jog like a sprint. Despite that, most fitness watches lump together cardiovascular and muscular recovery by necessity.</p><p>It&apos;d be nice if these watches could use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running form analysis</a> to adjust recovery time. I&apos;m sure tired muscles affect our vertical lift or cadence or could make our stride imbalanced. In lieu of that, Polar has you jump up and down three times with your hands on your hips. After a couple of tests, it&apos;ll have a baseline for your normal jumping abilities; if you fall short, you know you&apos;re not ready for a hard run. </p><p>I appreciate that Polar lets me check my physical recovery for myself instead of relying blindly on the algorithm. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aYBUfkVDoi4bDKBb3hmKSG" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-vo2-max-running-test.jpeg" alt="The VO2 Max running test on the Polar Vantage V3; showing a target pace, current pace, current/max heart rate, and other data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYBUfkVDoi4bDKBb3hmKSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then we have my absolute favorite: Polar&apos;s VO2 Max running test. I first tried it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-pacer-pro-review">Polar Pacer Pro</a>, one of my first running watch reviews, and I&apos;ve happily returned to it now that I&apos;m testing the Vantage V3. Essentially, it has you slowly pick up your pace from 15:00/mile downwards until you can no longer keep up, for about 10–15 minutes of easy-to-all-out running.</p><p>I ended up tiring out as I hit the sub-6:00 pace window and was rewarded with a 53. For context, that&apos;s two points higher than my Garmin VO2 Max average (51). Polar calls it "Very Good" for my age and gender, while Garmin would call it "Excellent." Either way, it&apos;s an improvement on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">where my VO2 Max was a year ago</a>.</p><p>I don&apos;t know which is more accurate; Garmin works from months of data, while Polar uses the traditional self-guided method. The only <em>definitive</em> way would be to go to a testing lab that measures your breathing on a treadmill. </p><p>Frankly, it doesn&apos;t matter to me which is better. I just want multiple ways to test for myself.</p>

<p>Raising your VO2 Max is a long, arduous process of increasing your training load week by week; the more you improve, the longer it takes to gain a point. At times, I&apos;ve questioned whether or not I&apos;m <em>actually</em> improving or if my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and its algorithm merely reward me for following the training load suggestions. </p><p>That&apos;s why having a way to spot-check your VO2 Max is so heartening. Seeing that 53 validated all of the hard track runs and boring low-aerobic jogs I&apos;ve done to try and improve over the past year. </p><p>It also triggered my competitive side: next time I do a manual VO2 Max test, I&apos;m not going to <em>let</em> myself get left behind until I push further into the 5:XX range and score higher!</p>

<p>Whichever smartwatch brand you buy, you must trust its algorithm, with no way to tweak the numbers or peek behind the curtain. You must have faith in a brand&apos;s reputation, and then spend weeks or months finding out whether the algorithm truly understands your fitness level and how often you need rest.</p><p>But even with the most reliable brand, worn for a long time, it doesn&apos;t always get things perfectly right. And that&apos;s to be expected!</p><p>Polar&apos;s algorithm isn&apos;t any more imperfect than other brands&apos; data. But the Vantage V3&apos;s testing suite caters to athletes who want to double-check Polar&apos;s suggestions for themselves, especially in the early days of using the watch, and I appreciate that Polar doesn&apos;t insist on blind trust — as other brands do.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&apos;ll have my Polar Vantage V3 review completed by next week. Thus far, it did pretty well in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">fitness test against COROS and Garmin</a>. I appreciate its comfortable design and straightforward access to specific tools — like Tests — with one or two button presses. </p><p>More pertinent to this discussion, I&apos;m hopeful that Polar will continue to expand this testing section over time. It has running, walking, and cycling fitness tests, all variations on the same theme, along with recovery tests. Maybe Polar could offer a hill/stair climber test to see how well you handle elevation gain or an arm strength test to go with its indoor exercise recommendations. </p><p>Dedicated athletes are competitive people, and when you give them a way to test and compete against themselves and their own fitness scores, that&apos;s always a recipe for success. </p>

<hr>
<p>Spotify recently made the news cycle for two big reasons. First, the company posted a campaign on X (formerly Twitter) outlining the reasons why it believes Apple is anti-competitive. Later, a leak revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-lossless-audio-expectation-leak">more information about Spotify&apos;s upcoming high-fidelity offering</a>, which has been in development since at least 2021. While other services like Apple Music and Tidal have had Hi-Fi support for years, Spotify notably still hasn&apos;t managed to ship it. </p><p>The fact that these two headlines broke within a day of each other highlights Spotify&apos;s strange hierarchy of priorities. It has spent years going to war with Apple, both through the legal system and through public campaigns. This is all while, in some ways, Spotify&apos;s actual product lags behind the competition. Spotify has key advantages, such as excellent discovery algorithms and superb sharing features. However, the lack of Hi-Fi and advanced features looms large in 2024.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’ve heard us talk about Apple’s anticompetitive practices—but what does that actually mean and why do we care so much? Here’s a break down and if you want to learn more head to: https://t.co/DP28elipIo pic.twitter.com/psrEpZPBXj<a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyNews/status/1786093384353878124">May 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Apple seems to be coming under fire from all angles, with governments and competitors claiming antitrust violations or anti-competitive practices—and in some cases, deservedly so. But the points Spotify outlines on its website leave out parts of the story. Although it would seem that Spotify is in a great market position, it isn&apos;t—and Spotify may be more to blame for that than Apple.  </p>
<h2 id="apple-is-changing-so-what-apos-s-stopping-spotify-2">Apple is changing, so what&apos;s stopping Spotify?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF" name="Spotify-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Spotify Premium on an Android phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s hard to take Spotify&apos;s position seriously when it makes blatantly misleading claims when trying to convince users and regulators to turn on Apple. On a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timetoplayfair.com/facts/" target="_blank">website</a> that lists five "facts that show Apple doesn&apos;t play fair," Spotify makes statements that appear misleading at best and intentionally false at worst.</p><p>The company says that Apple charges a discriminatory tax, but Spotify is referencing the fee that Apple charges developers who use its in-app purchase system, which can be as high as 30%. Apple would counter this point <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/">saying</a> that 86% of developers don&apos;t pay any fees, including Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify also says that Apple won&apos;t let it "share Spotify deals we know you&apos;d love," referring to an outdated App Store policy known as anti-steering, which is generally considered to be anti-competitive. However, now, Apple&apos;s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">App Review Guidelines</a> permit Spotify to show deals to users outside of the in-app purchase system, as long as it offers IAP as an option. </p>
<p>Additionally, Spotify says Apple won&apos;t let users easily upgrade to Spotify Premium, but this is false. Spotify has chosen not to offer in-app purchases on Apple platforms as a way to avoid the company&apos;s App Store fees. Spotify also does not let users buy audiobooks through its Apple apps to avoid paying in-app purchase fees.</p>
<p>Finally, Spotify says that Apple "routinely reject[s] our bug fixes and app enhancements." We&apos;re not sure exactly what this means because the company doesn&apos;t share specifics, but Apple has the right to deny updates or app submissions as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/terms/apple-developer-agreement/Apple-Developer-Agreement-20230605-English.pdf">Apple Developer Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>So, it&apos;s easy to see how Spotify and Apple are at odds. Spotify wants to use iOS and the App Store to the fullest extent — and to the same level as Apple Music, for example — without paying App Store and in-app purchase fees.</p>
<h2 id="spotify-has-its-own-problems-to-worry-about-x2014-and-apple-isn-apos-t-one-of-them-2">Spotify has its own problems to worry about — and Apple isn&apos;t one of them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="kWGZ6wr2t9dDGdmZW7pLEP" name="best-streaming-music-services-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Best music streaming services on the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3, and Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWGZ6wr2t9dDGdmZW7pLEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Spotify is the global leader among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a>, ahead of Apple Music. Despite having more than five times the number of Apple Music subscribers, Spotify has never posted a full-year net profit, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.barrons.com/news/spotify-passes-600-million-users-expects-profitable-2024-start-94dbb8af" target="_blank">Barron&apos;s</a>. If Spotify has a problem with its business model, Apple isn&apos;t the one to blame. As mentioned earlier, Spotify pays no fees to Apple since it opts out of the in-app purchase program. </p><p>In terms of feature set, Spotify isn&apos;t the clear winner among the music streaming services. Apple Music and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-vs-tidal">Tidal</a> both offer high-fidelity audio, and both include this functionality within their standard subscription plans. Meanwhile, Spotify said that Hi-Fi support would come at some point in 2021. Well, it&apos;s 2024, and the feature Spotify promised years ago still isn&apos;t here.</p><p>Separately, the way Spotify chooses to operate its free tier seems to be causing more friction with potential subscribers than ever. As of this May, the company started putting song lyrics behind a paywall, and people are <em>mad</em>. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1785741402808218052" target="_blank">social media post by Dexerto</a>, thousands of users flooded the comments criticizing Spotify&apos;s decision. </p><p>So, Spotify finds itself in an interesting position. The company isn&apos;t consistently profitable, it isn&apos;t able to deliver features by its self-imposed deadlines, and it is causing friction between Spotify and Spotify users. These are big problems, and it begs the question: doesn&apos;t Spotify have more pressing things to worry about than Apple? </p>
<h2 id="we-can-apos-t-blame-apple-for-everything-2">We can&apos;t blame Apple for everything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQA6wo7Mpgr6aTuXKm7UX7" name="iphone-15-pro-max-18.jpg" alt="iPhone 15 Pro Max review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQA6wo7Mpgr6aTuXKm7UX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple makes plenty of moves that can be considered anti-competitive, and it should face penalties when it takes steps to stifle competition. In many ways, governments and regulators are finally starting to hold Apple in check. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">European Union&apos;s new Digital Markets Act</a> introduced a slew of restrictions that have affected Apple since it was deemed a gatekeeper. In fact, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-apple-and-meta-are-under-investigation-in-europe-for-non-compliance-with-the-digital-markets-act">EU opened an investigation into Apple</a> for allegedly skirting DMA requirements. </p><p>Over in the U.S., Epic was successful in a few aspects of its antitrust case against Apple. Epic&apos;s win is the reason why Apple no longer has anti-steering rules in its App Review Guidelines, for example. There are also other pending lawsuits in federal court concerning Apple&apos;s alleged market advantage. </p><p>However, many of Spotify&apos;s examples of ways that Apple is creating an advantage in the music streaming service market are inaccurate. I&apos;m all for holding big tech companies accountable, including Apple. But coming after big companies just because it&apos;s popular isn&apos;t the reason antitrust rules and laws exist. Instead of coming after Apple, Spotify should make its product better — because, in many ways, it&apos;s behind the curve. </p>
<h2 id="where-does-spotify-go-from-here-2">Where does Spotify go from here?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WmnvJ73Rpc4DnYjGjRXFhe" name="Spotify-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-3-Fold-3.jpg" alt="Spotify on the Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 with headphones and earbuds next to them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmnvJ73Rpc4DnYjGjRXFhe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Spotify clearly wants regulation like the DMA, which is intended to prevent companies from giving preferential treatment to their own products and services, to extend worldwide. That might just happen, as the U.S. Department of Justice and the 50 states have launched multiple inquiries or lawsuits related to the practices of big tech companies like Apple and Google.</p><p>However, it&apos;s hard to see what a solution looks like. Apple Music, of course, doesn&apos;t pay a 30% fee for in-app purchases, unlike competitors in music streaming. But Apple can&apos;t pay a fee to itself. So, does Spotify want Apple to waive App Store fees across the board? In that scenario, Apple is paying for all the App Store overhead and providing developers valuable customer acquisition prospects without getting anything in return. </p><p>Maybe it could just waive the fee for streaming services like Spotify. It&apos;s an option, but maybe Apple <em>should</em> get an advantage for building entire devices and services from scratch. Remember, it only benefits from platforms it built from the ground up. Apple Music and Spotify compete on an equal playing field on all the others, including Android, Windows, and the web. </p><p>Whatever happens, it&apos;s clear that Spotify can&apos;t count on its situation improving on Apple platforms. It needs to control what it can control, like improving the Spotify experience on all platforms, including iOS and Android. Spending time on its feud with Apple will only divert resources from what actually matters: making Spotify better. </p>

This time, in a fresh round of layoffs, Google let go of 200 of its &apos;core&apos; employees to move faster and align with the company&apos;s goals.</p><p>These core teams were responsible for the technical foundation behind many of Google&apos;s products and services for security and online safety. The company has also reportedly started a "reorganization" that moves roles to India and Mexico.</p><p>Documents obtained by CNBC also suggested that employees found out about these cuts a week before they were announced, with Google stating that it would help it align with its "broader goals." Google&apos;s vice president of its Developer Ecosystem, Asim Husain, informed staff that "this was the biggest planned reduction" for the team in 2024, during a town hall. These cuts come at time, after Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 earnings report</a> announced a whopping $80.5 billion in revenue with "strong performance" across services. </p><p>Google confirmed these layoffs, and a spokesperson added that those affected can reapply for other roles within the company.</p>

While they don&apos;t churn out smartphones as often as other brands, a new leak indicated that its U24 Pro could give them another entrant in the market.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-htc-u24-pro-spotted.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>, it looks like the Taiwanese company might be getting ready to introduce the HTC U24 Pro this month. Even though there&apos;s no official word on the exact date yet, the U23 Pro was launch in May last year, which has could be a reason to expect the same with this year&apos;s addition.</p><p>A few days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/htc-u24-2qda100-geekbench-bluetooth-sig-certification/" target="_blank">MySmartPrice</a> caught sight of a device on Geekbench and speculated that it might belong to the HTC U24 series. The phone has model number 2QDA100, but that doesn&apos;t give away too much.</p><p>On the design front, the HTC U24 Pro will probably look a lot like its predecessor. That said, it might sport a faster processor —the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a>. As for the price, the U23 Pro hit store shelves at $350, and the U24 Pro is likely to stay in that range. We can expect the device to have Android 14 out of the box with either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage. </p>

The company also hinted at expanding its Galaxy portfolio by bringing Galaxy AI to "existing and new flagship" products like foldables and tablets. The other side of this business is its wearables, to which Samsung mentions the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>—something that could boost revenue later this year.</p><p>Smartwatches will also play a role, with Samsung stating it will look to "meet demand for upgrades through the launch of new premium models."

By comparison, Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-fy-q2-2023-earnings">FY Q2 2023 earnings</a> revealed a 17% drop in headset and overall revenue, so the recent numbers look positive.</p><p>"We are excited about our continued growth and diversification, including achieving our third consecutive quarter of record QCT Automotive revenues, upcoming launches with our Snapdragon X platforms, and enabling leading on-device AI capabilities across multiple product categories," says Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon in a statement.</p><p>With its current chipsets, Qualcomm is focusing on AI, which it expects will enable more use cases in various devices, be they phones, PCs, or cars. The company highlights its AI hub for developers to help drive this adoption.</p><p>"I want to step back and say, in general, I think AI is going to benefit all the devices," Amon says. "I think AI, when extends to running on-device—besides the benefit of working alongside the cloud—they have completely new use cases privacy, security, latency cost, personalization, etc."</p>

This is good news for anyone worried that the Pixel Tablet was poised to replace Google&apos;s smart displays since the tablet launched with a few features and accessories that made it an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">"almost" replacement</a>.</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking about this a lot lately and realized that Google needs to mash the Nest Hub and Pixel Tablet together and create something new and better.</p>

<p>A new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> that runs an instance of Gemini Nano is a thing Google could easily create.

<p>You would be left with a screen with a touch interface when you need it, a camera and/or sleep sensor array, a speaker that sounds nice, and apps like Chrome and YouTube to provide a good media experience.

<p>Gemini Nano is when smart AI "stuff" runs mostly on your device without reporting back to the Google mothership. It&apos;s built into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, powering various tools and all sorts of fancy camera tricks.</p><p>It&apos;s an important step forward for Google&apos;s AI team because, previously, almost everything had to go through the cloud. Google still offers bigger and more powerful AI models like Gemini Ultra that lean heavily on cloud computing, but with Gemini Nano, a mobile CPU, and some extra memory, you can do many things locally.</p>
<p>This is important. Local computing means everything is more private, is done faster, and doesn&apos;t rely on having a good internet connection. I don&apos;t care if Google knows how many times I turn the lights on or off or that I asked what the square root of 15 was (3.87, I saved you a click). I might care about the next smart display feature, though. And if any AI processing is to be done on a camera-equipped device in my bedroom, I&apos;d rather it be locally. I <em>might</em> be able to peel the tape covering the lens off. Might.</p><p>Even better, Gemini can do so many things better and faster than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> can. Yes, I know there are things Assistant can do that Gemini can&apos;t or struggles to get right, but I assure you that Google is working on Gemini and wants to replace Assistant completely. Out with the old, in with the new, even if it doesn&apos;t work 100% of the time. That&apos;s the Google way.</p>

<p>Gemini means a Home Hub can be more than a light switch or a way to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-vs-nest-doorbell-battery">who is knocking on the front door</a>. The way it can parse information and do other things with it is what AI is good at doing, and as a bonus, it can better interpret the things we tell it to do. Here at Chez Hildenbrand, we love to yell out to Google so it can add stuff to the grocery list. Gemini does that better because it understands us better. That&apos;s pretty important for a voice-operated device. I do not doubt that Gemini will eventually power <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">smart displays</a>.</p><p>This would be in Google&apos;s best interests, too. Sell a Nest Hub "Ultra Max Pro" (or some other silly name) powered by Gemini Nano that does everything advertised on the box. Power users could buy into more powerful versions of the Gemini AI model if they wanted, providing Google finds a way to build compelling features using them.</p>
<p>I used to think replacing a cheap smart display with yet another Android device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-pixel-tablet-isnt-going-to-fix-whats-wrong-with-android-tablets-on-its-own">Pixel Tablet</a> was a bad idea because there was no benefit that was worth the cost. With the release of Gemini Nano, I&apos;m not so sure about that anymore.</p><p>I still want to see a basic (and cheap) Nest Hub that works the same (infuriating) way it works now, but I also want to see more. And better. Google can do this, and it just might if the company thinks it&apos;s something we want to buy. I have a feeling people would want to buy it once they understand why.</p>

It also offers an impressive battery life, easy compatibility with both iOS and Android, and a really pretty overall design. Depending on your price point, you may not mind a few of the Versa 4&apos;s downsides, like how it doesn&apos;t include Google Assistant capabilities, third-party app support, or basic music streaming.</p><p>Either way, $50 off makes this smartwatch pretty appealing, even with its shortcomings.</p>

<p>At 25% off the normal purchase price, the Fitbit Versa 4 is a pretty solid deal, especially if you need a basic, bare-bones smartwatch. From its long battery life and sleek aesthetic to easy compatibility with iOS and Android, the Versa 4 isn't anything too complicated, and that isn't a bad thing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a> starts at a fairly reasonable price point, but the extra $50 discount makes it a little easier to overlook some of the watch's downsides.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re just looking for a simple, no-frills fitness smartwatch at a good price; battery life is a big selling point for you; you&apos;re looking for a watch that can resist some water submersion.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t mind paying a little more for a premium smartwatch.</p><p>We called the Versa 4 one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbits</a> that money can buy, and despite a few minor issues and some somewhat dated hardware, it remains a good option for most people, especially when you pair it with a deal like this.</p><p>With its reasonably sized 1.58-inch AMOLED display and super minimal design, this is a pretty good-looking fitness watch overall. The upsides of the Versa 4 also include its over-six-day battery life, quick charging, and a range of basic sensors like GPS, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and more. It&apos;s also highly compatible with iOS and Android, as well as Alexa, though it doesn&apos;t work with Google Assistant. </p><p>Those willing to spend a little extra might consider the Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a>, but at this price point, you really can&apos;t go wrong with the Versa 4, either. </p>
