                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I received a Suunto Race review unit in mid-May, only for Suunto to release a newer Race S the following month with doubled heart rate LEDs, a lighter design, and few downgrades for $100 less. That, along with a bundle of Wear OS watches from Samsung, Google, and OnePlus to test all summer, put it on my back burner.</p><p>So yes, this Suunto Race review is nearly a year out of date from its late 2023 launch. It stayed in my mind, though, because it has most of the main ingredients I want in a modern running watch: a bright AMOLED display (sorry, MIP fans), a 16-day battery life, dual-band GPS, training load data borrowed straight from TrainingPeaks, downloadable topographic maps, and a unique app store for downloading niche training tools.</p><p>Once I found the time to put it through its paces, the Suunto Race software — particularly its SuuntoPlus apps — took a long time to master, but it rewards you for the effort. Perhaps my biggest issue with the Suunto Race is with the fundamentals: when I tested its HR and GPS accuracy, they didn&apos;t quite live up to my expectations. </p><p>That said, this is a very strong watch for the $450 price range, giving the equally-priced Garmin Forerunner 265 and COROS APEX 2 Pro a run for your money.</p>

<p>The Suunto Race was released in October 2023. The newer Race S launched in June 2024, adding a few new software features that also arrived on the Suunto Race. </p><p>It starts at $449 for the stainless steel version and $549 for the titanium version, which weighs slightly less and has double the map storage space. The steel versions ship in All Black, Midnight Blue, Birch White, and "UTMB World Series," which has a black case and unique strap. The titanium edition ships in Charcoal and Amethyst.</p>

<p>Most fitness watch brands are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">transitioning from MIP to AMOLED displays</a>, and the Suunto Race is exhibit A for why it&apos;s a good thing. You&apos;re getting a watch that lasts over two weeks per charge or about 40 hours, using four satellite systems and dual-band GPS simultaneously, and still getting a 1,000-nit, high-res display. I don&apos;t begrudge people who need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-for-battery-life">max battery life</a> like the 90-day Garmin Enduro 3, but I&apos;d say the Suunto Race has hit the good-enough threshold for most athletes.</p><p>The Suunto Race uses a rotating crown and start/back buttons, giving you three customizable shortcuts for the crown press and top/down long-presses. You can prioritize functions like the flashlight, music controls, notifications, alarms, or weather. The crown shortcut highlights one pinned widget, so you can jump quickly to data like your training progress widget or workout logbook, or open the compass or map quickly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AMzxhNK7uaTbKNEakzJtkD" name="Suunto-Race-training-load-progress.jpeg" alt="The Suunto Race training load progress widget." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMzxhNK7uaTbKNEakzJtkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Suunto app splits off between a Home feed of your workouts, a Calendar view, a Training Zone — which summarizes your recent Training Load, Intensity, Impact, and Recovery — and a map view with heat maps that show where Suunto users train. Unlike other apps that put more focus on health, sleep, paid coaching, or tie-ins to other products, Suunto keeps things focused on training, which I appreciate.</p><p>In particular, the Training Zone section is pretty neat. You get a Suunto Coach text summary that clearly describes your recent progress, before you dive into the charts and numbers. You see a weekly summary of your training load and training stress (aka intensity) that&apos;s compared against your chronic training load for a form (Training Stress Balance) score. It all may sound complicated at first, but once you memorize the acronyms, it provides a ton of useful context for serious runners.</p><p>I especially like how Suunto provides an Intensity chart that shows how much time you spend in HR zones 1–5 across the week, as well as pace zones and running power zones. I wrote about wanting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">better training load zone analysis</a> recently, and Suunto checks many of those boxes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VbVom3xR46ckhk74G9etSC" name="Suunto-Race-elevation-gain.jpeg" alt="The Suunto Race showing the author's elevation gain atop a hill." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbVom3xR46ckhk74G9etSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can download offline maps across hundreds of countries and territories, with the maps split up for the larger countries. In the U.S., for example, I downloaded Northern California (2GB), but most other states (and many countries) are smaller. Most people will be able to make do with the standard 16GB of storage unless you frequently travel for training; downloading maps is painfully slow, so you&apos;re not going to want to swap map packs often.</p><p>Next you can create a route, either by using the simple map creation tool and tapping waypoints or importing a GPX file from third-party apps like Strava. You can also find other people&apos;s public routes using heatmaps, though you may not find many except in major population areas or national parks. Uploading them to your watch is quick and managing your route library is painless.</p><p>Speaking of third-party integrations, Suunto offers plenty of SuuntoPlus apps made by third-party tech brands or community members, filling the gaps left behind in Suunto&apos;s software. You can add SuuntoPlus apps on the watch itself, naturally integrating the new tech into your favorite sports modes. They also let you sync with certain devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-body-temperature-sensor-thermal-load">CORE Body Temp sensor</a> I tested earlier this year.</p>

<h2 id="suunto-race-gps-accuracy-tests-2">Suunto Race GPS accuracy tests</h2>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">How I test</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">For GPS accuracy, I use my <strong>Garmin Forerunner 965</strong>, which beat other dual-band GPS watches from COROS, Polar, Samsung, and Apple in previous tests. For testing optical HR accuracy, I use my <strong>COROS Heart Rate Monitor</strong>, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">compared favorably</a> against a HRM chest strap.</p></div></div>
<p>At the end of multiple runs and a long hike, the Suunto Race added at least one-tenth of a mile to each activity compared to what my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> tracked. Given how well the latter usually does for dual-band GPS accuracy, that had me worried about the Suunto Race&apos;s own accuracy. Analyzing the charts, though, the answer is a little more complicated.</p>

<p>In each of the GPS paths above, the Suunto Race (<em>blue line</em>) generally matches my location, sometimes doing better than Garmin (<em>orange</em>) at knowing which side of the trail I&apos;m on. The immediately obvious problem is how every one-second reading seems to fling me from one diagonal to another, like I&apos;m a running back practicing my juking skills.</p><p>I&apos;m still moving forward and avoiding the drastic tracking issues I see with GPS-only watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>; I don&apos;t want to give the impression that Suunto does terribly here. But without fail, after every mile Suunto is an extra one-hundredth of a mile ahead of Garmin, and by the end of a long workout the gap adds up. </p>

<p>I also took both watches out on a ten-mile hike; by the end, Suunto had added two-tenths of a mile. You can see in the screens above how well it does tracking me in dense foliage, never losing me the way most smartwatches would. But whether my signal is obscured or direct, you see that same frantic zig-zagging effect at random moments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ovD2fw35H2jmZ9vfxt75Qf" name="Suunto-Race-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-965-GPS-comparison-9.jpeg" alt="A GPS map showing how the Suunto Race (blue line) and Garmin Forerunner 965 (orange line) compare for a track workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ovD2fw35H2jmZ9vfxt75Qf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Suunto Race doesn&apos;t have a track run activity, but it did pretty well at matching my lane-3 sprints around my local track, despite some wobbliness. It ended up adding about 80m to my total after ten laps. (Garmin&apos;s track line is artificially centered because of its Track Run activity, so ignore it.)</p><p>This watch is old enough that Suunto is probably past the point of algorithm fixes, but I feel like Suunto is <em>close</em> to nailing its tracking, in some ways better than other dual-band watches at avoiding straying lines.</p>
<h2 id="suunto-race-hr-accuracy-tests-2">Suunto Race HR accuracy tests</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1429px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.99%;"><img id="YsPPPN9BBmxxaPjkBfJYSK" name="Suunto-Race-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-965-HR-comparison-1.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the COROS Heart Rate Monitor and Suunto Race optical HR sensor compare for accuracy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YsPPPN9BBmxxaPjkBfJYSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1429" height="700" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Suunto Race&apos;s optical heart rate monitor, I&apos;d already heard that Suunto doubled the LED sensors in its Race S successor watch and tweaked its algorithm in response to Race HR criticism. So I compared it against my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a> to see how it matches against a reliable optical sensor (the above chart says "Garmin Forerunner" because my COROS synced to that watch).</p><p>For all four activities, the Suunto&apos;s HR average fell 1–2 bpm short. During the 15K run above, the Race always stays close, but it&apos;s apparent how its reading never quite catches up to my actual heart rate, averaging 2 bpm short (166 vs. 164).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.20%;"><img id="8azd6tNLGLccn2ATQzg8eK" name="Suunto-Race-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-965-HR-comparison-2.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the COROS Heart Rate Monitor and Suunto Race optical HR sensor compare for accuracy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8azd6tNLGLccn2ATQzg8eK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1420" height="727" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During a shorter 10K, the gap was only 1 bpm, but the shorter timeline makes it easier to see moments where Suunto&apos;s reading dips and rises at odd increments while the secured COROS band has my heart rate staying steady. That has me suspecting that the Suunto Race does have small tracking blips that add up, and that the Race S&apos; extra LEDs might help with that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.45%;"><img id="4VFAHTTBvah65HkZbJL86e" name="Suunto-Race-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-965-HR-comparison-3.jpeg" alt="A HR chart showing how the COROS HRM and Suunto Race compare for optical HR results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VFAHTTBvah65HkZbJL86e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1749" height="725" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For my final track workout, the Suunto Race struggled. Some gaps might be due to inconsistent pausing after laps, but that doesn&apos;t explain the Race registering me at my max 200 bpm during my first 800m; trust me, I wasn&apos;t running that hard yet. Otherwise, there were two clear moments where its HR was ten bpm above my actual rate, and two moments where it was ten bpm <em>below</em>. The overall average was just 2 bpm off, but I wasn&apos;t thrilled with the data.</p><p>Overall, I&apos;d say the Suunto Race&apos;s GPS accuracy is good enough to get by and better than whatever GPS-only watch you currently have, but it could be better. As for heart rate, this is a watch where I&apos;d probably recommend you keep wearing an external heart rate monitor if you need hyper-accurate results, but it&apos;s otherwise good enough to give you accurate HR zones for your training load data.</p>

<p>Aside from my complaints about accuracy, my biggest note with the Suunto Race is its weight. Suunto sent me the titanium model, and at 69g, it&apos;s on the heavy side for a running-focused watch; most other flagships weigh in the mid-50s with a silicone band, or use a nylon band to hit that range. I feel a little bit of wobble when pumping my arms hard, though it&apos;s still not as heavy as, say, a Samsung or Apple Ultra watch.</p><p>My issue is that most buyers will choose the 83g stainless steel Race to save money. For people used to all-steel watches, they won&apos;t mind, but many runners will find that weight onerous. That&apos;s why many runners will prefer the 60g Race S, accepting the smaller and less-protected display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Uao2EY9PjAcpCTeVPADCB9" name="Suunto-Race-run-summary.jpeg" alt="A post-run summary screen on the Suunto Pace." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uao2EY9PjAcpCTeVPADCB9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I never mind running with my phone, the Suunto Race mandates it if you want music playlists or contactless payments. Some of this is outside of Suunto&apos;s control — it&apos;s hard for smaller brands to get banks and streaming services to play ball — yet many runners will choose other brands because they can&apos;t do without music storage and NFC.</p><p>While I praised most of the main Suunto app tools, one conspicuous absence is any kind of free training plan software that adapts to your recent workouts, like you get with Garmin or COROS. Suunto has a list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.suunto.com/en-us/Support/faq-articles/suuntoplus/which-partners-offer-suuntoplus-guides/">SuuntoPlus app integrations for training guides</a>, but most of them (like TrainingPeaks) require a payment or syncing your data regularly with another platform. I&apos;d argue Suunto needs its own native equivalent.</p><p>As for other missing features other fitness brands offer, Suunto doesn&apos;t have safety tools like location sharing, challenges, gear tracking, or the option to pre-select multisport options. You won&apos;t find any ECG or skin temp readings, either.</p><p>Lastly, I&apos;m not the biggest fan of Suunto&apos;s watch face system. You can only save nine to the watch, and they&apos;re hidden in the SuuntoPlus store with only 21 total options by my count, none of them especially pretty or creative. You can&apos;t add a custom background, most faces only let you add three complications at most, and syncing faces to the watch is weirdly slow.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> is ranked as our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watch</a> because it offers great training tools without costing as much as flagship models. Compared to the Suunto Race, it has some deficiencies: its Gorilla Glass 3-protected display isn&apos;t as bright or scratch-proof. It only has breadcrumb navigation, with maps reserved for the 965. Its plastic bezel doesn&apos;t look nearly as classy. And while their daily battery isn&apos;t so different (16 vs. 13 days), the Suunto Race crushes the Forerunner 265 for dual-band GPS hours (40 vs. 14 hours).</p><p>Still, it has its perks! The Forerunner 265 is significantly lighter, even if you don&apos;t buy the smaller 265S, and it has the upside of contactless payments and music storage if you want to go phone-less for your run. It also does slightly better on the GPS accuracy front, and offers both daily suggested workouts and adaptable Garmin Coach training plans. Whether you prefer the up/down buttons or Suunto&apos;s crown is a matter of preference.</p>

<p>Aside from Garmin, Suunto&apos;s biggest fitness-watch rivals are COROS and Polar. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">COROS APEX 2 Pro</a> also costs $449, and thanks to its MIP display it can last 30 days per charge, though its 26-hour dual-band GPS tracking still falls short of Suunto&apos;s. It has a titanium bezel, ECG readings, 32GB for downloadable maps, comparable training load software, and downloadable training plans.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a> is a pricier $599, making it a hard ask unless you&apos;re considering the titanium Suunto Race. It, too, has all the training guidance, recovery recs, accurate GPS and heart rate data, and full-color maps on an AMOLED display that you could ask for. I especially like its tests for things like muscle soreness and current VO2 Max. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Suunto Race if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a long-lived AMOLED running watch with in-depth training metrics.</li><li>You want premium features at a mid-range running watch price.</li><li>You want the Suunto Race's 10ATM water resistance, sapphire glass, and extra week of battery life compared to the Suunto Race S. </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Suunto Race if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Suunto Race S, with its revamped HR data, lighter design, and lower price, appeals to you more.</li><li>You need music storage or contactless payments.</li><li>You want an adaptive training program that sends workouts to your wrist based on past activities.</li></ul>
<p>My review title says it all: The Suunto Race is near the finish line for me. </p><p>The Suunto Race S allegedly fixed some of the optical HR issues and made it even more affordable and more comfortably lightweight. Once Suunto catches up on adaptive training plans and a couple of other areas, it&apos;ll have everything I&apos;d want in a running watch at a lower price tier than other brands, like COROS except with AMOLED instead of MIP displays.</p><p>Still, as comparatively minor as the Suunto Race accuracy issues are compared to other mainstream smartwatches, they&apos;re big enough that I&apos;ll happily turn to other brands that avoid those issues.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>high-quality cameras are a major priority for you when it comes to buying a phone; you don&apos;t mind a last-gen device; you want access to Google&apos;s latest AI features; you&apos;re looking for a phone that offers several years of Android OS updates.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather go with an affordable phone subscription through your wireless carrier; you have extra money to spend and would rather upgrade to the Pixel 8 Pro or Pixel 9 to get industry-leading cameras.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8 is a high-quality last-gen phone, and with an extra $200 off, it isn&apos;t a hard purchase to justify. Those hoping to upgrade to the Pixel 8 Pro or the newer-generation Pixel 9 lineup may want to consider those options, but those needing high performance at a budget, last-generation price will be likely to get what they need out of this phone. It offers a beautiful 6.2-inch OLED display with a refresh rate of 120Hz, offering some top-tier video and gaming. It also comes with 128GB of storage for this deal, or you can upgrade to 256GB while still getting 12% off.</p><p>Beyond being generally a good-looking phone and display, users love the Pixel 8&apos;s camera, Gemini AI features, and its incredibly user-friendly interface. Its powerful performance is backed by the Google Tensor G3 chipset and 8GB of RAM, and useful battery-saving features can get users as much as 24 hours of battery life per charge.</p>

But I&apos;m not going to lie, Anker and UGREEN in particular have been slaying hard. Both brands make very high-quality gear, but Anker&apos;s style focuses on aesthetics whereas UGREEN has taken a more unique approach — adding adorable faces to its already sleek-looking accessories.</p><p>I test a new power bank or charger every week, more than one most weeks in fact. At one point, everything starts to blend into one, which is why differentiation like this is so important to keep things fresh.</p><p>UGREEN has released entire families of kawaii-faced chargers and I&apos;m all for it. Not only do they look adorable, but they also have all the speed and power you could want. The cutesy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-rg-65w-review">Nexode Robot GaN series</a> has 65W and 30W options. I&apos;m even more excited about UGREEN&apos;s latest launch, the Uno lineup of accessories that includes a Qi2 charging station, a USB-C hub, and even a 100W USB-C cable with a display, in addition to several power banks and chargers.</p><p>Amazon just confirmed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Day 2.0 for October 8 through 9</a>, and UGREEN always has awesome Prime Day deals. So, it is the perfect opportunity to splurge on charging tech that is both functional and adorable! Here are some of my favorite kawaii UGREEN chargers and portable battery packs that I have tested and highly recommend. Add them to your holiday shopping list as these are excellent gift ideas.</p>

<p>The UGREEN Uno 2-in-1 charger gives you two wireless charging pads, a MagSafe/Qi2 stand, and USB-C charging all in one endearing package that is sure to put a smile on your face.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0D4DX8PH3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9d6bf4d9-38e5-45e0-8636-c487d889ef47" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="UGREEN Uno 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger 15W: $69.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="UGREEN Uno 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger 15W: $69.99 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>This precious Qi2 charger is actually a charging station with a smiling face on the display. It delivers 15W wirelessly to compatible Android and iOS devices. The foldable Qi2 pad on top is magnetic, so you can plop on a MagSafe iPhone or any Android device that supports wireless charging. For Android phones, a good old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe adapter ring</a> will easily add magnetism. Since it tilts and stays put at any angle, you can use it as a phone holder as well as a charging stand.</p><p>Apart from that, there&apos;s also a hidden 5W wireless charging pad underneath the foldable 15W pad. It&apos;s advertised for Apple AirPods but I tested regular wireless earbuds and those charge just as well. There are two USB-C ports, one input port on the back to power the charging station itself and another 5W USB-C output port to charge one more device.</p>

<p>This cable grins at you while charging devices, which is a charm all on its own. If you need a Power Deliver 3.0 cable that supports 100W charging, I highly recommend the affordable UGREEN Uno USB-C to USB-C Cable 100W. Plus, it comes in 6.6ft and 3.3ft length options.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0D7B719XQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="53f4a20e-4fc4-4fce-8890-f3f58e733f51" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="UGREEN Uno USB-C to USB-C Cable 100W: $12.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="UGREEN Uno USB-C to USB-C Cable 100W: $12.99 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Our phones, tablets, and laptops all use USB-C ports now, and most of the best phones and devices all support very high-speed charging. If you&apos;re using any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charger</a> that has a charging speed of 60W or above, you need to use a compatible 5A cable with it to actually get that speed. These are also called e-marked cables. When you use a 100W or above charger, you need to bump your e-marked 5A cable to a 100W cable instead of a 60W one.</p><p>Don&apos;t waste your money on an uber-expensive e-marked cable. Get UGREEN&apos;s Uno USB-C to USB-C Cable 100W instead. This nylon braided cord is un-rippable and highly durable and it delivers the fastest charging speed for 60W to 100W chargers. It can even withstand a respectable amount of biting or clawing from your cat or dog.</p><p>I adore all of UGREEN&apos;s braided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a>, but this one is even more awesome because it has a display built-in. I expected the display to show the wattage at which the device was charging, but it had smiling eyes instead. It&apos;s not very practical, but it sure looks nice. Not to mention, this $13 cable is filthy cheap so it doesn&apos;t matter if the LED display is purely superficial.</p>

<p>While this isn&apos;t a charger, it can be used as one by extension when connected to a laptop or a Chromebook. The UGREEN Uno 6 in 1 USB-C Hub is the perfect companion for Chromebooks, notebooks, and all other PCs that lack sufficient ports. As a signature of the UGREEN Uno series, this hub has an LED display that lights up with a smile when in use.</p><p>This lightweight <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-hubs-chromebooks">USB-C hub</a> adds one HDMI 2.0 port, two 10 Gbps USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, two 10 Gbps USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port, and one PD 100W USB-C port. It supports Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Linux platforms. I used it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Lenovo Duet 5 Chromebook</a> because it has a grave lack of ports and it was a seamless experience.</p><p>In addition to that, UGREEN also promises that you can use this hub with Android and iOS phones and tablets. I connected a typical USB-A thumb drive to my OnePlus 12R using the UGREEN Uno 6 in 1 USB-C Hub and it worked perfectly. I was able to view and copy files very easily. So I can attest to its Android compatibility as well.</p>

With it comes support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>, which has been supported on Android for some time now. As a result, texting between iOS and Android users gets a bit better, with typing indicators, higher-quality media, better group texting, and more.</p><p>Of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">experience isn&apos;t perfect</a>, with features like end-to-end encryption missing (although it&apos;s supported between Android devices), and that&apos;s likely because Apple went with the GMSA version of RCS, which is different from what Google implements on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a>. However, GSMA states it&apos;s working on bringing cross-platform E2EE and other features, which should further improve the texting experience.</p><p>Now, there&apos;s less reason to complain about green bubbles (but you know they will anyway).</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Samsung has shown off rollable concepts before, but the latest rumor suggests the company may finally be ready to bring one to market. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30115">The Elec</a>, Samsung is reportedly switching directions and focusing its efforts on getting the rollable device ready for a launch potentially during the second half of 2024. That puts the device launch roughly around the same time as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">successor</a>.</p><p>There isn&apos;t much known about the device, but it could unfurl to greet users with a 12.4-inch display with an under-display camera.</p><p>According to The Elec, Samsung likely feels some kind of way about Huawei launching the first tri-fold phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">Mate XT</a>. Samsung likely wants to beat everyone else to the rollable finish line (something we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/lg-rollable-hands-on-video">expected from LG years ago</a>).</p>

Well, the company is taking its tech elsewhere and partnering with Google to help develop a new reference platform for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> to utilize Masimo&apos;s biosensing technology.</p><p>According to Masimo, Wear OS OEMs will be free to design their phones however they want, while Masimo will design and test the internal components for health tracking/sensing. This also includes the companion app, although it&apos;s unclear how this will be handled.</p><p>Nonetheless, the partnership should help boost Wear OS health tracking and may even encourage more OEMs to step in and join the platform. Following the recent Apple lawsuit, the timing of the partnership is suspect, but we&apos;re not complaining.</p>

One device we hope to see is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3s</a>, which will likely be a cheaper, more accessible version of the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>. We weren&apos;t sure how much cheaper it would be, but now we may have an idea, thanks to an Amazon leak.</p><p>According to the image, the Meta Quest 3s may start at just $299, which is $200 cheaper than its flagship sibling. The image also shows what the Quest 3s may look like, featuring a similar overall design but with two sets of three individual lenses on the front. We also expect the device to be powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 for better performance, although it will likely feature Fresnel lenses instead of pancake ones, which is likely to keep costs down.</p><p>If this is to be believed, a $299 price point for a newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headset</a> would likely do well, especially ahead of the holidays, for anyone still wanting to get their hands on a Quest VR headset but not wanting to get the older Quest 2.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re not familiar with it, Life360 is a service that tracks people&apos;s movements and the devices you&apos;ve placed in a group.

You&apos;re alerted where each person is through their devices — either a phone with the app or a Tile device — as well as their movements to and from. You can get configurable alerts when someone has left a destination when they&apos;ve arrived, how long it took, and as they&apos;re moving along the way. In addition, you can see when someone&apos;s battery is dangerously low or the last place they were if connectivity is lost and even a notification when a flight has landed.</p>

<p>In my testing, I found everything to work exactly as advertised. If my wife left home to go to the grocery store, I was able to track her progress as well as when she left or if she had to stop for gas. If you take the time to enter friendly names for the locations you frequent, they&apos;re used in the notification so you&apos;ll see a message like "Terry is at Exxon" instead of knowing someone drove for 11 minutes and is at a spot on a map that might not mean much to you.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tile.com/products/new-arrivals">2024 Tile lineup</a>, there&apos;s a new SOS feature through the Life360 app. You can tap the button on a Tile three times and trigger an alert to everyone in your circle or call designated emergency numbers. This too works as advertised, though I did not connect any emergency phone numbers or services. This works in tandem with a crash detection feature to offer peace of mind for a lot of people. This SOS feature is free for all membership tiers.</p><p>Additionally, the new Tile trackers are integrated fully into the Life360 app and it can be used to locate and ring connected devices the same way the standalone Tile app can.</p>
<p>For reference, I&apos;m using Life360 with location permissions allowed on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a>, and my wife is using it the same way on a Pixel 7a. Both of us notice a minimal effect on battery life but no real impact on performance, though there are a lot of notifications if you keep everything enabled.</p><p>My takeaway is that the app works well with the new Tile devices and does everything it&apos;s supposed to do. The permissions it requests make sense, though it does share <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/life360-tiles-new-owner-and-has-been-selling-user-location-data">some personal data</a> with third parties. You&apos;re able to request deletion of all of your data should you wish to do so. These data safety practices will vary based on where you live but this is how it works in the United States.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to a Tile refresh. I still use Tile trackers because they make the most sense for me. I live in Appalachia. It&apos;s peaceful and beautiful here, but you won&apos;t see very many iPhones or new Android phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-embraces-future-ultra-wideband-apis-android">UWB</a>. Google and Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">device tracking solutions</a> may be better than Tile&apos;s in some places, but not here. I have been able to locate a lost wallet because of Tile&apos;s Bluetooth network, so I&apos;ll stick with what works. </p><p>At my house, we use Tile on our keys and wallets and keep one in the car. My wife also has a Tile attached to the strap of her purse, and I have one in the pocket of my laptop bag. We are Tile customers and have been for a while.</p>
<p>As mentioned, I use Tile through the standalone Tile app, not Life360. The new Tile hardware should work well for me, too.</p><p>The Tile Mate, Tile Slim, and Tile Pro have increased their effective range up to 500 feet from a connected phone. That&apos;s half a football field and if you are in an area with plenty of traffic chances are someone using either the Tile app or the Life360 app will come into range on occasion. A larger range means a better chance to find your lost stuff and that&apos;s why you want a device like a Tile.</p><p>The Tile Mate, the Tile Pro, and the Tile Sticker have also had their speakers buffed to be louder than previous models—a lot louder, in my experience. This makes things easier to find, whether they are stuck on the couch or dropped in the bushes.</p><p>Finally, something my wife has been hoping for: the Tile Mate and Tile Slim come in different colors. You can choose from black, blue, green, orange, pink, white, or yellow as well as different combinations of each. For an accessory you will have on your keys or a bag, it makes sense. People will buy a Tile simply because they are colorful.</p>
<p>I like what I see from the new Tile devices. I&apos;m testing a Tile Mate, a Tile Slim, and a Tile Sticker, and again, they do exactly what was expected. I&apos;ll buy a second Tile Mate and a Tile Pro to replace the ones I currently have, and once the battery dies on my Tile Slim, I&apos;ll purchase a new one to replace it.</p><p>One last thing—Tile Stickers work best when stuck to a piece of Velcro so they can be moved to a different device whenever you need to move one. Other wise they are pretty well stuck in place.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MWHtk4hLDb7MPBBreF9dyd" name="Tile-Slim.jpg" alt="Tile Slim" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MWHtk4hLDb7MPBBreF9dyd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the stickler. Many people would consider Life360 to be invasive. Some consider it an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/04/06/sex-traffickers-use-parenting-apps-like-life360-to-spy-on-victims/?sh=7e0a27be64c3">aid in human trafficking</a> or for secret surveillance and predatory.</p><p>Having used the service, I can certainly see how it could be used that way. It&apos;s fairly trivial to secretly install it on someone&apos;s phone, and hiding app icons isn&apos;t difficult. I could install Life360 on someone else&apos;s phone and probably get away with using it while they didn&apos;t know if I had access to their phone for just a few minutes.</p><p>Slightly more concerning, but in the same vein, both Apple and Google&apos;s apps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out" target="_blank">find unknown trackers</a> do not detect a Tile device in your vicinity. Granted, the devices do nothing if not connected to the Tile network through a proper companion app, but I know from experience that plenty of people are part of the Tile network. I could put a Tile Sticker on your car without you knowing it and have a good chance of keeping tabs on your movements with incredible detail.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s the thing: the Life360 app and devices to help you track items and people are useful to a lot of people. Life360 says one of every nine U.S. families uses their service and needs this sort of software. It works well and has minimal effect on your battery which is exactly what a service like this should do.</p><p>These folks aren&apos;t part of a human trafficking network or stalking an ex-girlfriend. When people do these things, it&apos;s not Life360&apos;s fault, and there are plenty of other services out there that will do the same thing even if Life360 goes away.</p><p>I can&apos;t blame a company for the horrible things people do, even if a product it offers makes those horrible things easier. Life360 is not marketing itself as a way to secretly track someone; it bills itself as a way for families to keep tabs on their kids or elderly seniors. It would be really good at it if that sounds like something you need. </p>
<p>I have issues with sharing personal data, and my family is small; no teenagers are driving my car to keep track of, and my mom has a sound mind. Life360 isn&apos;t for me, even though there are a few handy features, such as knowing my wife&apos;s phone went dead while she was out for the afternoon.</p><p>Other families are different and may find it very useful. If you&apos;re looking for an app like this, Life360—especially with the new Tile devices—works very well, and you should have a look at it.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for an app to do anything nefarious, you&apos;ll find one. You can&apos;t blame a company that has done the work to legitimize itself.</p>

Perhaps the Steam Deck is partially to blame for this, but instead of being powered by Windows or SteamOS, there are a bunch of Android gaming handhelds.</p><p>Ayaneo is one of these companies leading the way, taking its experience from Windows handhelds and attempting to make waves in the Android handheld space. The Pocket Air is Ayaneo&apos;s first foray into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handhelds</a>, offering a unique take in more ways than one.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pd8iSnKDxQdpMmWPejydZJ" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-logo-backplate.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Air close-up on backplate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pd8iSnKDxQdpMmWPejydZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ayaneo Pocket Air was originally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocked-air-android-handheld-gaming">announced</a> in August 2023 before it was officially released in September 2023. Initially, it was available through an Indiegogo campaign, coming in a few different configurations. Now, the Pocket Air can be purchased directly from the Ayaneo website.</p><p>When announced, three different configurations were available, starting with the 6GB/128GB model for $299 and maxing out with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Currently, the 8GB/256GB variant has been sold out for some time, but the 12GB/512GB version can be had for $399.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-air-what-i-like"><span>Ayaneo Pocket Air: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="DHdqeTprTWg5rKNT5zzqX3" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-sea-of-stars.jpg" alt="Sea of Stars on Ayaneo Pocket Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DHdqeTprTWg5rKNT5zzqX3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not like the Pocket Air was the first gaming handheld to hit the scene, but something that has helped it stand out is the 5.5-inch OLED display. This, paired with the retro-inspired colorway, makes for an intriguing handheld gaming solution.</p><p>Keeping with the design, there are slight bump-outs on the left and right sides, offering some decent ergonomics. It pales in comparison to the likes of the Steam Deck or Lenovo Legion Go, but at least it&apos;s not another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/pimax-portal-review">Pimax Portal</a> or Nintendo Switch situation.</p><p>Besides that, the Pocket Air has all of the buttons you&apos;d expect from a gaming handheld, with a few extras. First, the two buttons in the bottom right corner operate as shortcuts. The larger of the two activates a panel that slides in from the right, where you can quickly view and change performance or fan profiles on the fly. Meanwhile, the smaller button simply takes you back to AyaSpace, the company&apos;s proprietary launcher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="43kxNDoN9gLh2RbmyBvMdP" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-buttons-thumbstick.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Air close-up on buttons and right thumbstick" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43kxNDoN9gLh2RbmyBvMdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, there are a couple of extra tricks that the Pocket Air has up its sleeve. For one, the power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner, which is great for jumping back into a game quickly without entering a PIN or drawing a pattern.</p>

<p>My favorite "trick" of the Pocket Air comes via the pull-out tray on the bottom. Not only is there a microSD card slot, which is important if you have a massive library of games, but if you flip the pull-out microSD card tray over, you&apos;ll see a cutout for a tiny card. That&apos;s right; you can pop a SIM card into the Pocket Air and play games literally anywhere without being tethered to Wi-Fi.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iA5c4EoarpiWC68kJoCvYN" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-microsd-card.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Air microSD card slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iA5c4EoarpiWC68kJoCvYN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for performance, MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 1200 can handle pretty much anything that you throw at it. This includes the likes of PS2, GameCube, and even some Switch games, especially if you opt for one of the higher-end models that are equipped with more RAM.</p><p>Don&apos;t expect to emulate Tears of the Kingdom here, but for lighter-weight titles, the Dimensity 1200 barely breaks a sweat. It&apos;s also worth pointing out that thanks to the massive fan cutout and active cooling system, I never once felt the Pocket Air get too hot to hold.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-air-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Ayaneo Pocket Air: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="atVRaaXBCdj3tPopQ5BvUd" name="pimax-portal-review-13.jpg" alt="D-Pad comparison between Ayaneo Pocket AIR and Pimax Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atVRaaXBCdj3tPopQ5BvUd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I previously mentioned that it&apos;s possible to emulate Switch games on the Pocket Air. While that is technically true, the Dimensity 1200 just isn&apos;t powerful enough for higher-end Switch titles. Compounding the limitations of MediaTek&apos;s chip is the lack of third-party driver support.</p><p>While MediaTek chips are more affordable compared to Qualcomm, the latter is still preferred due to better community support. MediaTek processors are fairly "locked down" in this regard, making it more difficult for custom drivers to be created that support the various chips.</p><p>Frankly, it&apos;s a bit disappointing to see, especially when you consider that some MediaTek processors outperform Qualcomm equivalents in "raw" power. However, if the power can&apos;t be optimized properly, then those performance differences aren&apos;t available and shouldn&apos;t be included in your decision-making.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PqxrazS3JKRMT8sYGckduQ" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-apotris-gba-pizza-boy-a.jpg" alt="Top-down view of Ayaneo Pocket Air playing Apotris" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqxrazS3JKRMT8sYGckduQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of that being said, there&apos;s a pretty good chance that you aren&apos;t going to try to push the Pocket Air to the absolute limits. However, it&apos;s still something to keep in mind so you better understand what&apos;s possible.</p><p>While it probably won&apos;t be a dealbreaker for those who plan to play retro games, it is disappointing to see the refresh rate capped at 60Hz. At the very least, I think the Pocket Air should have featured a 90Hz refresh rate, even if the company didn&apos;t (or couldn&apos;t) match the likes of the Razer Edge.</p><p>One of the problems with the Pocket Air at launch was that you couldn&apos;t remap on-screen controls to the built-in controller. Thankfully, this has been remedied via subsequent software updates. However, I&apos;m still not the biggest fan of the AyaSpace launcher and interface. Thankfully, there are a few alternatives that work quite well, including ES-DE, Beacon, and Daijisho.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q6AgHp4XKcQjgnN4j8EpYL" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-es-de-nintendo-switch.jpg" alt="ES-DE launcher on Ayaneo Pocket Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q6AgHp4XKcQjgnN4j8EpYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I&apos;ve come to find that the D-Pad on the Pocket Air is just a bit too mushy for my taste. It&apos;s almost like the Pocket Air and Pimax Portal are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p>The problem is that with a mushy D-Pad, there have been times when I&apos;m playing Apotris or older Tetris games, and the pieces are one or two slots off from where I was trying to place them. This isn&apos;t an issue during the early levels, but it&apos;s definitely frustrating when the pieces are flying down and one wrong move ends a run prematurely.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-air-the-competition"><span>Ayaneo Pocket Air: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hWfBF4dBBJScbEVpV3QWF5" name="ayn-odin-2-tloz-tears-of-the-kingdom.jpg" alt="Tears of the Kingdom on AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWfBF4dBBJScbEVpV3QWF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It seems that Ayaneo is attempting to take over the Android gaming handheld space, and it all started with the Pocket Air. Since then, the company has announced the Pocket S, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">Pocket DMG and Pocket Micro</a>. However, at this price point, Ayaneo&apos;s stiffest competition comes in the form of the AYN Odin 2 and Odin 2 Mini.</p><p>The Odin 2 and Odin 2 Mini are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>, making it more powerful than the Dimensity 1200. As mentioned previously, this also means that there is better driver support for emulators. Then again, neither the Odin 2 nor Odin 2 Mini are equipped with an OLED display, giving the Pocket Air a pretty clear advantage.</p><p>There&apos;s also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">Pocket S</a>, which was announced last year and is one of a handful of devices to be powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. However, it won&apos;t take long for you to see that the Pocket S offers a more premium design. With that comes a higher price tag, starting at $589 for the base model.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're looking for a good and powerful starter Android gaming handheld. </li><li>You want a handheld with an OLED screen. </li><li>You don't want to spring for a Steam Deck or ROG Ally X.</li><li>You want a handheld with LTE connectivity and expandable storage. </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget.</li><li>You want the most powerful Android gaming handheld.</li></ul>
<p>Ayaneo got a lot of things right with the Pocket Air, as it&apos;s one of a few handhelds that sport an OLED display. Plus, it&apos;s currently one of two handhelds that allow you to use it with a SIM card, with the other being the Razer Edge. However, it seems that the Edge is getting phased out as it&apos;s becoming more difficult to purchase, and a successor has not been announced.</p><p>With that in mind, the Pocket Air is a great entryway into the Android handheld scene, especially for beginners or those who have no interest in higher-end emulation. It&apos;s comfortable to hold and offers great battery life. Even if you aren&apos;t a fan of AyaSpace, you can download a different launcher.</p>

The FCC’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-405545A1.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/att-fined-13m-for-data-breach-after-giving-customer-bill-info-to-vendor/" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>) says AT&T didn’t do enough to protect customer information.</p><p>AT&T handed over customer data to the vendor between 2015 and 2017 to create personalized video content. The customer information was supposed to be returned or deleted once it was no longer necessary—something that should have been done long before the breach happened.</p><p>Their contract required AT&T to make sure the data was securely deleted by 2018. However, the vendor held onto the data for years, which eventually led to the 2023 breach.</p><p>The FCC stated that AT&T not only dropped the ball on making sure the vendor safeguarded customer data but also didn’t follow up to ensure it was returned or deleted.</p><p>Luckily, the breached data didn’t include sensitive information like passwords, Social Security numbers, or credit card details. Most of what was exposed related to customer accounts, like billing balances.</p><p>As a condition of the settlement, AT&T has vowed to strengthen its data management practices and set up clear protocols for safeguarding customer information. These improvements are expected to be quite costly, likely exceeding the $13 million fine.</p><p>Although the 2023 data breach was a major event, it wasn&apos;t AT&T&apos;s first run-in with such issues. Last April, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/73-million-atandt-accounts-leaked">had to reset passwords for around 73 million customers</a> after their credentials were found on the dark web. This incident sparked a flurry of class-action lawsuits from affected customers.</p><p>In July, the carrier revealed that a large chunk of its customers&apos; phone and text records <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/atandt-data-breach-compromised-phone-records-of-nearly-all-its-customers">was compromised in a data breach</a> linked to the cloud platform Snowflake. The fallout also affected customers of AT&T-owned networks like Cricket Wireless and other carriers that use AT&T’s infrastructure.</p>

<hr>
<p>It&apos;s Friday and Meta is rolling out a series of updates for Instagram full of bright colors and fun times.</p><p>Today (Sept 20), Instagram users are advised to prepare for new expressions to hit the social media platform. As detailed in a press release, Instagram is hauling in a total of 38 new stickers for users to utilize when creating Reels and Stories. The major batch of stickers includes the days of the week in stylized, graffiti-like font, hearts with attitude, "W," take an "L," 4K, Sound On, and loads more.</p><p>During your Story or Reel creation, users hopping into the editing room can find these new stickers listed among the rest. Popping in a sticker gives you free reign over its placement, so you can get your point across the right way for the right vibe.</p><p>Instagram says users should begin noticing all 38 new stickers today (Sept 20), though give it some time if you&apos;re not seeing it right away.</p><p>Additionally, Instagram highlights a hidden gem within the app that you might not&apos;ve known was there. You may have heard of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-play-pong-with-emojis-in-this-secret-instagram-game">Emoji Pong</a>" before — and, yes, it&apos;s like the pong you&apos;re familiar with.</p>

<p>The post states users can play the game in a DM with another person. All it takes is for you to tap on an emoji someone sent. The "ball" that you&apos;re playing pong will be whatever emoji it is you&apos;ve tapped. The game&apos;s background will change colors the longer and higher your score rises.</p><p>Instagram will also keep track of your high score at the top right corner.</p><p>Instagram&apos;s latest update in August brought a feature that&apos;ll have you thinking of MySpace (if you know what that is). Users could attach <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-letting-you-share-songs-right-from-your-profile">their favorite song</a> to their Instagram profile within their bio. Those who pay a visit can tap the song and begin listening if they choose. Meta likely avoided the idea of auto-play to avoid any unwanted audio playing on devices.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-imagine-me-selfie-all-platforms">implementing Meta AI</a> into its apps from Instagram to Messenger. The software came with a new feature called "Imagine Me," an AI tool that lets users become whatever they&apos;d like. After completing a series of brief steps, the AI will attempt to generate an image based on your query.</p><p>Meta AI uses your selfie to turn you into things like a DJ or an astronaut.</p>
