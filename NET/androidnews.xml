<p>Case and accessory makers for mobile devices can&apos;t stay away from controversy in recent months. After Casetify came under fire for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/dbrand-and-jerryrigeverything-sue-casetify">allegedly stealing Dbrand&apos;s custom designs</a>, Dbrand is now involved in a scuffle of its own.</p><p>The company, known for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">device skins</a> and snarky online presence, made a joke about a customer&apos;s last name after they asked the company for support. Dbrand&apos;s original post on X (formerly Twitter) has been viewed over seven million times and was called out by users in replies as awful, unprofessional, and racist.</p><p>In light of the backlash, Dbrand offered the customer $10,000 and a personal apology, the company shared today.</p><p>The fiasco started when Bhuwan Chitransh reached out to Dbrand on X about a MacBook skin purchased from the company that showed signs of discoloration. </p><p>In a reply, Dbrand&apos;s customer support account (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/robot/status/1777459061065146763" target="_blank">@robot</a>) said: "Like most surfaces, dirt and grime can accumulate on the surface of a skin over time. You can clean it using a microfiber cloth lightly dampened with isopropyl alcohol." The account also stated that the customer should send an email to Dbrand if there are any further issues. </p><p>Afterward, Dbrand&apos;s main account — followed by 2.3 million X users — quote replied to Chitransh&apos;s original request for help with the following response:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your last name is basically shit rash, be serious https://t.co/SmQd5So5bS<a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1777823124479734097">April 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The company originally had a bullish response to the backlash that followed. While opinions of Dbrand&apos;s joke varied, there seemed to be a consensus in the replies to the company&apos;s original post that the comment was offensive. One user told Dbrand to "keep the same energy in the apology tweet," to which the company replied "no." Dbrand&apos;s official account continued to post memes and snarky replies to the controversy on Tuesday, April 9. </p><p>Dbrand posted an apology on Wednesday, April 10, admitting that the company "made fun of a guy&apos;s name" and "it was a huge fumble." The brand also offered the customer $10,000 "as a gesture of goodwill" and rejected claims that the move was hush money. "To clarify, this offer has no strings attached," Dbrand said in a DM to Chitransh. "We just want to make amends for our lapse in judgement and the chaos that ensued in your world."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well that escalated quickly.1. Yes - we made fun of a guy's name. It was a huge fumble.2. We apologized to him directly and offered him $10,000 as a gesture of goodwill.3. We've been poking fun at customers on social media for over a decade now. We're not going to stop, but…<a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1778136614788600226">April 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>However, whether Dbrand is actually remorseful for its comments is up for debate. "We&apos;ve been poking fun at customers on social media for over a decade now," it said in the so-called apology post. "We&apos;re not going to stop, but maybe next time you&apos;ll be the one who gets $10,000."</p><p>Android Central contacted Dbrand for comment about the controversy, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

Well, not only are you getting one of the sleekest smartwatches on the market, but Google managed to provide quite a few upgrades over the original Pixel Watch. Perhaps the best part of it all is seeing new features and improvements made on the software side of things.</p><p>Mant features are similar to what you&apos;ll find on the original Pixel Watch, but there are still some differences between the two. With that in mind, let&apos;s dive into the first things to do with the Pixel Watch 2. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-emergency-sos-and-fall-detection"><span>Set up Emergency SOS and Fall Detection</span></h2>

<p>First introduced in late 2022, Google added the ability for your Pixel Watch to reach out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-emergency-sos-pixel-watch">Emergency Services</a> or a loved one if you need assistance. Although we hope you&apos;ll never have to use it, we still recommend getting everything set up, just in case. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Wake your Pixel Watch</strong> by tapping the screen or pressing either the side button or the crown.</p><p>2. <strong>Swipe down </strong>on the watch face to reveal the <strong>Quick Settings panel</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Settings (cog icon)</strong> button.</p><p>4. Scroll down and tap <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>.</p><p>5. Tap <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>.</p><p>6. Tap the toggle next to the <strong>Emergency gesture</strong> and <strong>Countdown alarm</strong> to enable them.</p><p>7. Go back to the previous screen and tap <strong>Emergency location service</strong>.</p><p>8. Enable <strong>Emergency location service</strong> functionality.</p><p>9. Exit the Settings app.</p>
<p>The feature is available for both generations of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a>, with the only difference coming down to whether you own an LTE or Wi-Fi model. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> with LTE, your smartwatch will be able to make the necessary calls directly. Otherwise, your phone will need to be within range of your smartwatch as it will rely on the phone to make the call. </p><p>Another new feature introduced by Google for the Pixel Watch lineup is the ability for your wearable to detect when you fall. It does so by utilizing on-device Machine Learning paired with the built-in motion sensors. It, too, is available on both the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2, but like Emergency SOS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-enable-fall-detection-pixel-watch">Fall Detection</a> needs to first be enabled. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Pixel Watch</strong> app on your phone. </p><p>2. Scroll down and select <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>. </p><p>3. Tap <strong>Fall detection</strong>. </p><p>4. Tap the toggle next to <strong>Use fall detection</strong> to the <strong>On</strong> position.</p>
<p>When your Pixel Watch 2 recognizes that you&apos;ve fallen and need assistance, it will "vibrate, sound an alarm, and check if you need help." This happens after 30 seconds, and if you don&apos;t respond, it will then call emergency services using an "automated message that provides your location and requests help."</p>

<p>One of the more surprising features introduced with the Pixel Watch 2 was the ability to finally sync Do Not Disturb and Bedtime Mode with your phone. This has been a long-requested feature, and until it was revealed, left many wondering why it wasn&apos;t already available. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Pixel Watch</strong> app on your phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Notifications</strong>. </p><p>3. Swipe down and tap the toggle next to <strong>Sync across watch and phone</strong>. </p>

<p>Previously you would have to set up the DND and Bedtime Mode on your phone and watch, separately. It was more of a headache than anything else, so needless to say we&apos;re happy to see this feature added.</p>

<p>When Google announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-december-2023-update">December 2023 Feature Drop</a>, the company finally added the new Watch Unlock feature. This was originally introduced back in 2022 but had yet to actually make its way to devices. </p><p>Watch Unlock is fairly similar to the Smart Lock functionality that we&apos;ve enjoyed on Android for years. With this feature set up and enabled, you&apos;ll be able to automatically unlock your phone without needing to enter a passcode. As you might suspect, this feature needs to first be enabled before you can start using it. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Watch </strong>app on your phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Watch preferences</strong>. </p><p>3. Tap <strong>Security</strong>. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that you don&apos;t have to stick to the built-in watch faces that Google provides. There are plenty of watch faces and apps you can download from the Play Store if Google doesn&apos;t have anything that tickles your fancy. Check out the next section to get started with the Play Store on your Pixel Watch 2.</p>

<p>One area that used to be a point of contention when it came to the Wear OS platform was the quality of the apps. In 2023, Google began making strides to change that, as it introduced new requirements for developers in order to provide a "basic consistent experience across all apps." </p><p>While smartwatch apps aren&apos;t nearly as feature-rich as their phone counterparts, they can still come in handy. Plus, with the addition of complications to various watch faces, your Pixel Watch 2 can become even more versatile than it already is.</p><p>When you go through the initial setup process, you&apos;ll be prompted to install apps that are already available on your phone. But you can also manually search for and install apps right from the Google Play Store app on your wrist. Google has even made it easy to install <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-apps">Wear OS apps</a> from your phone, thanks to the drop-down menu next to the install button in the Play Store.  </p>

<p>Along with using a different watch face, another way to customize your Pixel Watch 2 is to utilize a different watch band. Maybe the default silicone band has just worn out, or you want something to match your outfit. Thankfully, there are a plethora of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-bands">Pixel Watch 2 bands</a> available, even with Google still utilizing a proprietary band connector. </p><p>You can even go so far as to use <em>almost</em> any band that tickles your fancy, as you can grab an adapter, attach a traditional 20mm watch band, and be on your way. This makes for endless combinations for you to mix and match depending on what you&apos;re doing, or your mood.</p>

<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> is that many of them use a proprietary charger. This includes the Pixel Watch 2, as it&apos;s not even the same Qi charging puck as the original Pixel Watch. Instead, Google opted to introduce pogo pins, as it provides faster and more reliable charging speeds. </p><p>While Google includes a charging cable in the box, we highly recommend picking up a spare one. Otherwise, you might end up like my colleague Nick Sutrich, who had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-rabbit-just-ate-my-pixel-watch-charging-cord-and-now-im-screwed">rabbit chew through his Pixel Watch cable</a> and was out of luck until he grabbed a replacement. </p><p>It&apos;s also worth pointing out that if you&apos;re upgrading from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> or Versa 4, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-you-charge-the-pixel-watch-2-with-a-fitbit-charger">those chargers will work</a> with the Pixel Watch 2.</p>

<p>Although the hardware might have been a bit lackluster, in some regards, that&apos;s not the case with Fitbit&apos;s mobile app. It&apos;s become pretty clear that Google is set on slowly rebranding the Fitbit that we knew and loved. However, Google has also shown that the Fitbit app will be how you keep track of your various workouts and metrics.</p><p>Google includes six months of Fitbit Premium with every Pixel Watch 2 purchase, giving you access to "exclusive workouts, mindfulness sessions, and more." Fitbit Premium also offers a variety of other features, including personalized insights and even a wellness report. </p><p>Even if you opt out of Premium after the six-month trial has concluded, the Fitbit app still serves as the hub for tracking your various health metrics. During the setup process, you&apos;re prompted to connect the Fitbit app to your Pixel Watch 2, and from there, we recommend checking out what the app has to offer. Plus, the six-month trial should take plenty of time to determine whether it&apos;s worth signing up for the subscription or just relying on the free features.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-editing-features-availability/">announced</a> on Wednesday, April 10, that it is expanding its popular AI photo editing features in Google Photos. Not only will more users have access to certain features, but they will be able to use these features at no extra cost and without a subscription.</p><p>According to the company, these features include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photo-unblur-pixel">Photo Unblur</a>, Portrait Light, and more. These will work on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> running Android 8 and newer or iPhones running iOS 15 or higher, and devices must have 3GB or more. For Chromebook users, the features are limited to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-models-now-available">Chromebook Plus</a> devices running ChromeOS 118 or higher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PYyQcceTs9Ze3B25JPr42j" name="Google-Photos-ai-editing-tools.jpg" alt="Google Photos Magic Editor and Photo Unblur" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PYyQcceTs9Ze3B25JPr42j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to expanding these features across more devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> is set to expand beyond the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series, allowing "all Pixel devices" to make more complex edits. However, while these features are free for more users, the company will limit the number of Magic Editor saves they can make. Android and iOS users will only be able to make 10 of these saves per month unless subscribed to a 2TB or higher <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plan, which will unlock unlimited saves. Pixel users will also automatically have unlimited saves.</p><p>For Magic Editor, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128850?visit_id=638483618616951387-3483905442&p=editing_features&rd=1&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1#zippy=%2Ccreate-a-cinematic-photo%2Cuse-suggested-edits%2Cuse-tools%2Csave-new-shots-from-your-motion-photos%2Cuse-magic-editor">support page</a> notes that "your device must have a 64-bit chipset with at least 4 GB RAM and Android 8.0 and up."</p><p>In 2023, Google surprisingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/magic-eraser-google-one-android-ios">expanded the Pixel-exclusive Magic Eraser</a> to more users through Google Photos, but the feature required a subscription if you didn&apos;t already own a Pixel phone. The fact that even more AI features will be available without a subscription is a welcome surprise.</p><p>Users can expect to see these features rolling out starting on May 15.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A feature that tracks and finds lost devices isn&apos;t a new idea. Both Google and Apple have been doing it for years, but as technology advances, things get updated, and Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">started rolling out the new Find My Device</a> network in North America.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-can-now-quickly-google-find-my-phone-find-lost-android-device">idea isn&apos;t new</a>, but how it&apos;s done and what it can do sure is. With a network of well over a billion devices, you can now find your lost phone — and plenty of other things — more easily and in a way that makes it secure by design.</p>
<p>Part of what makes it better is what it can do. Five cool new features make the new feature better than the older version:</p><p><strong>1. The ability to locate offline devices.</strong> You can locate your Android phone or tablet on a map and send a notification to make them ring even when they aren&apos;t connected to a network. If you use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro</a>, this even works when the phone is turned off or the battery is dead. We&apos;ll talk more about that a bit later.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use new Bluetooth trackers to keep track of other things.</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-announces-google-find-my-device-compatible-trackers">Third-party companies</a> are soon releasing small tags for use with Google&apos;s network. You can attach these tags to anything and keep tabs on it through the Find My Device network. They&apos;re also built to be compatible with Google and Apple&apos;s unknown tracker alert system to make sure nobody can use them without you knowing it.</p><p><strong>3. Locate nearby devices. </strong>If you&apos;re close to something you&apos;re looking for, a button will appear that lets you figure out exactly where it is. As you get warmer, the shape fills and as you get colder it shrinks. Nifty.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iGE2HpfXohwqj6iiDRjyUZ" name="find-my-device-1.png" alt="Find My Device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGE2HpfXohwqj6iiDRjyUZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1179" height="663" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>4. Use Google Nest devices to help find things at home.</strong> With things like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Nest Home</a> as part of the new network, it&apos;s easier to find lost things in your house. Your Nest devices only work to find your stuff in your house, thanks to the built-in home protection of the new network.</p><p><strong>5. Share accessories with your family or friends.</strong> You&apos;ll be able to share a compatible Bluetooth accessory or tracker with others so they can keep tabs on where it&apos;s at, too.</p>
<p>So it seems like the new feature is really cool and very comparable to what Apple has been doing with it&apos;s own network. Under the surface it&apos;s a lot different, though. Let&apos;s dig in.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.68%;"><img id="zzVhapjd9TH4kfEm2MeqCY" name="google-find-my-device-locator-io-2023.jpg" alt="Using proximity to locate a lost item through the Find My Device network." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzVhapjd9TH4kfEm2MeqCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="837" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The short answer is Bluetooth. Almost everything has a Bluetooth connection nowadays, and leveraging it in a way that reports where it&apos;s at concerning other Bluetooth devices makes sense. Never lose your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">favorite earbuds</a> again.</p><p>Imagine you&apos;ve attached a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-joins-google-find-my-device-tracker-debut">Chipolo tracking tag</a> to your keyring. It has a Bluetooth radio inside that "broadcasts" its location so that other devices that are compatible with and have enrolled in the new Find My Device network can "listen" to it.</p>
<p>All these devices report data back to Google in aggregate, and if you want to find your keyring with its attached Chipolo tracker, you&apos;ll get a location based on how far it is from other devices.</p><p>Knowing how far it is from one device does nothing, but when you have billions of devices, you can get a very close estimate of the actual location. When you get close, the strength of the Bluetooth signal is used to fill a shape on your screen until you&apos;re right on top of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zPu2oHj32ksQWjJVw6coqf" name="Google-Find-My.jpg" alt="A render of Find My device against a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPu2oHj32ksQWjJVw6coqf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only thing left to do is make it all secure and private. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html">Google tries to do this</a> in a few different ways, such as through aggregation and encryption.</p><p>You&apos;ll need to opt-in to the feature, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/14796936?hl=en&ref_topic=7651004&sjid=3104889368197014343-NC">you&apos;ll have three options</a> — opt out completely, contribute to aggregation, or use the network without contributing to aggregation. To explain exactly what Google means by aggregation, here are its own words:</p><p>"With aggregation, the Find My Device network waits until multiple Android devices have detected a lost item. Find My Device then shows the owner of the lost item a center point calculated from the multiple location reports."</p>
<p>What this does is tell a user where a thing is without telling them where any of the devices that help find it are located. If your phone tells Google where a luggage tag is located, the person who owns the luggage tag has no way of knowing where you are or that you contributed at all.</p><p>In addition, when Google sends location data to you, it&apos;s end-to-end encrypted using a key that is only accessible to the tracker owner and anyone it&apos;s shared with. This means nobody but you (or another person you authorized) can use it — this data can&apos;t be shared even if you want it to be shared.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.00%;"><img id="HtSmnGGTuG6cdU4ey7Vaem" name="find-my-device-3.png" alt="Find My Device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HtSmnGGTuG6cdU4ey7Vaem.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two other important features are worth noting. The service has what Google calls "At Home Protection," and the way it works is that as long as you&apos;re in the places you&apos;ve designated as Home, your Android devices don&apos;t contribute location reports back to the Find My Device network. Nobody can use this data to find out where you live.</p><p>The last thing worth noting is that all of this is compliant with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">unknown tracker alerts industry standard</a>. If someone tries to use a tag to track you, you&apos;ll get notified once your phone notices it is close to you and stays close to you. If someone sticks a tracker on your car or in your purse, it&apos;s going to tell you.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-not-to-love-2">What&apos;s not to love?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m sure that privacy advocates will look closely at what Google has done, find things that aren&apos;t ideal, and maybe Google will address them. In the meantime, I see two issues that need to be discussed.</p><p>The first is tracking your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>&apos;s location when the phone is turned off, or the battery is dead. All Google says is, "Thanks to specialized Pixel hardware, Pixel 8 and 8 Pro owners will also be able to find their devices if they&apos;re powered off or the battery is dead." That&apos;s not helpful at all, and with Google&apos;s track record when it comes to privacy, we need to know more.</p><p>I expect Google will tell us more at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O</a>, and in the meantime, I&apos;ve reached out to the company in search of more concrete answers regarding this "specialized hardware" and how it works. If I get any, I&apos;ll share them.</p>
<p>The second thing isn&apos;t an issue with the service at all. If it works as well as it sounds, it&apos;s a crying shame Apple isn&apos;t on board.</p><p>Yes, Apple has a service that uses a high-frequency radio to do the same thing, and if you&apos;re in a country like the U.S., where half the people have an iPhone, it works well. However, the downside is that it won&apos;t work if you&apos;re not in an area with a high saturation of iPhone users (and such places exist in the world).</p><p>If Apple wanted to, it could piggyback on Google&apos;s service and make it better for everyone. Sometimes, companies should stop squabbling and do what&apos;s best for their customers. This is one of them.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hate the idea of anything tracking me, and I don&apos;t trust Google when it comes to collecting data because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-incognito-mode-update">the sketchy things</a> it has been caught doing. However, this service seems like it&apos;s worth it, and with the safeguards Google has in place, it seems secure and safe. I&apos;ll be using it once trackers become available after Google I/O.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Private Space will supposedly allow users to store private apps separately and suggest using a dedicated Google account for enhanced security.</li><li>The feature will enable the installation of apps privately, either through a dedicated button or by long-pressing apps outside Private Space.</li><li>Private Space will appear in the app drawer with a lock icon and can be customized, such as hiding the icon for discretion.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The upcoming Private Space feature in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> has made several appearances in various builds of Android 14&apos;s Quarterly Platform Release (QPR) updates. With the recent release of more code in the latest Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 build, we&apos;ve got the full scoop on how this feature works and what it looks like.</p><p>Back in December 2023, Mishaal Rahman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-private-space-first-look/" target="_blank">spilled the beans</a> on a new feature dubbed Private Space, believed to be making its debut with Android 15. At that time, nobody knew much about it, and it seemed like it was just a way to hide apps and files securely, keeping them away from prying eyes.</p><p>A few days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-spaces-revamp-features-added">more privacy options popped up</a>, including the ability to automatically lock Private Space and hide sensitive information from your lock screen. It&apos;s like the Secure Folder on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>, where you choose what to secure and how. And now, a new report shows this privacy feature in action.</p><p>According to a video Rahman shared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-private-space-hands-on-3432113/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Private Space is described as a feature where you can stash private apps in a separate corner of your phone. It also suggests using a dedicated Google account for added security.</p>

<h2 id="here-apos-s-the-lowdown-on-private-space-2">Here&apos;s the lowdown on Private Space</h2>
<p>To get Private Space up and running, go to Settings, pick "Security & privacy," and finally tap Private Space. Once there, you&apos;d need to verify your identity. After that, you&apos;d sign in to a Google account to make it simpler to add apps to Private Space.</p><p>Private Space&apos;s setup process differs from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung&apos;s Locked Folder</a>. It&apos;s a bit more complex since it suggests setting up a separate Google account specifically for Private Space. The goal seems to be to ensure that your data and browsing history stay isolated within Private Space rather than mixing with your regular account. Nevertheless, users still have the freedom to choose whichever Google account they prefer to use.</p><p>Another significant update to Private Space is its feature that allows the installation of apps privately, keeping them hidden from outside view. These apps are downloaded using the Google account linked to the created space. According to Rahman, users can download apps within Private Space using a dedicated "install apps" button or by long-pressing an app outside the space, which prompts an option to "install in private."</p><p>Once you&apos;ve turned on Private Space, you&apos;ll spot it at the bottom of your app drawer with a lock icon and the label "Private." Just tap the icon to unlock it. You can adjust Private Space settings anytime, like hiding the icon from the app drawer to keep it discreet. If you try to change any Private Space settings, you&apos;ll need to unlock the feature first.</p><p>Some apps are automatically in your secure space, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a>, Contacts, Drive, Files, Photos, and the Play Store. If you want to add more, tap "Install Apps" and choose the ones you want. Or, long-press an app and pick "Install in Private."</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t officially released the feature yet, but it&apos;s speculated that upcoming Android 15 beta updates might come with it.</p>

<p>Android 15 is on its way to an Android phone near you, and while Google continues releasing early builds to developers, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-could-support-bluetooth-audio-sharing">Android 15 preview revealed</a> a promising feature for music lovers like myself. It looks like Bluetooth audio sharing across devices might be available natively once the new platform update rolls out, and I couldn&apos;t be more excited.</p><p>Listening to music on a Bluetooth speaker is enjoyable, but it&apos;s not always ideal. Sometimes, you and your friend or partner might want to listen to the same audio and still want some privacy. In the days before the advent of TWS Bluetooth earbuds, such scenarios would usually involve sharing a pair of wired earphones or using an AUX splitter.</p><p>Unfortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/editors-desk-headphone-jack-isnt-coming-back">3.5mm audio port is severely endangered</a> at this point. This means watching the same movie or YouTube video on a phone or tablet with someone requires you to use the device&apos;s speakers or give one wireless earbud to each individual. And if you&apos;re wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">over-ear headphones</a>, it&apos;s simply not possible.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about you, but I find this to be annoying time and time again. Every once in a while, my husband and I bicker over who gets which earbud when watching something or listening to music. This usually happens when we&apos;re traveling.</p>

<p>Samsung rolled out a nifty solution for this many years ago. The feature is called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-dual-audio-on-a-samsung-phone">Dual Audio</a>, and most of the brands&apos; phones have it. You can connect two audio devices to a phone via Bluetooth and stream the same audio to both simultaneously. This can be headphones, earbuds, or speakers, as long as your Samsung phone and the audio gadget have Bluetooth 5.0 or higher. There&apos;s a two-device limitation, but it&apos;s still a great way to watch something or listen to something with someone.</p><p>Non-Samsung Android phones do not come with this feature. This got me thinking, and I found it strange that they don&apos;t because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/how-to-use-multipoint-audio-switching-pixel-buds-pro">Multipoint connection</a> has been around for several years now. Since you are already able to connect several devices to a single phone via Bluetooth at the same time, why not add the ability to push audio playback at once, too?</p><p>I was curious, so I did a little digging. Turns out things are a little more complicated than that. Multipoint revolves around the ability to receive audio from multiple sources. Being able to connect and output to several devices simultaneously requires different technical specs, which may explain why only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> have Dual audio. The exact working details of this are still fuzzy, and I&apos;ve reached out to Samsung for more details on how the company is able to get Dual Audio working on its devices, but I did not receive a response in time for publication. However, I will update the article once I get more information. However, it&apos;s clear that compatibility plays a role here.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Dual Audio is an algorithmic optimization that makes it possible for Bluetooth 5.0 and higher devices to stream audio output to two devices simultaneously. While it has been around from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-dual-audio">era of the Galaxy S8</a>, Samsung improved the feature and highlighted it more from the Galaxy S21 series onwards.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1481px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rpDnfioPHFwNryr3z2ZdTG" name="samsung-dual-audio.jpg" alt="How to use Samsung Dual audio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpDnfioPHFwNryr3z2ZdTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1481" height="833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung isn&apos;t the only one with this feature though. Apple phones have a similar audio-sharing feature, and just like Samsung, devices must support Bluetooth 5.0 or above. iPhones can share audio to multiple audio devices via Bluetooth.</p><p>Now, as spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">Android 15 developer preview</a>, it looks like more Android users will be able to share their phone&apos;s audio playback to multiple devices. Although the feature was not functioning in the preview at the time of writing, it did display an option to share the audio with "everyone," further leading us to believe that there might not be a mere two-device limit, which is very exciting.</p>
<p>Based on everything shown, I assume the feature is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">Bluetooth Auracast</a> technology. Auracast was previously known as Audio Sharing, but it underwent a facelift very recently.</p><p>Bluetooth SIG launched the new and improved version of the feature in June 2022, but we had yet to see any devices launch with it until recently, again, thanks to Samsung and One UI 6.1, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">recently rolled out</a> to select Galaxy flagships. Auracast was also shown off at CES 2024, following which several Samsung devices, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a>, were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-2-pro-auto-switch-auracast-update">updated</a> to support it.</p><p>The best part about Bluetooth Auracast is that it has no device limitation; you can broadcast audio output to as many devices as you like with it. And since it requires <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE Audio</a> and Bluetooth 5.2 to work, it&apos;s safe to assume that it won&apos;t consume as much power as Bluetooth Classic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C" name="Bluetooth-Auracast-hero.jpg" alt="Bluetooth Auracast audio sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we draw closer to the estimated July release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, my hopes are getting higher and higher. Google often picks up Samsung&apos;s most in-demand features and merges them into Android. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> is one such example, and audio sharing over Bluetooth could be the next one to follow suit.</p><p>I&apos;m banking on Google to popularize this feature and bring it to all Android users. If the audio-sharin feature is indeed powered by Bluetooth Auracast, it&apos;s going to be even more useful and versatile.</p><p>All the signs are there; I just hope it plays out as seamlessly as it did in my head. This could change the way we use our wireless audio gadgets in such a big way, so it would be a darn shame if incompatibility or other issues held it back.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio sells products in about a dozen categories, but it&apos;s the brand&apos;s budget DACs and IEMs that contribute to its bottom line in a meaningful way. There has been a lot of excitement in this area in recent months, with Fiio launching a lot of new models in its dongle DAC range, and the brand is now focusing on its Bluetooth offerings.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">KA11</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka13-review">KA13</a> do a great job delivering a clean sound in a tiny chassis, they need to be plugged in — you don&apos;t get Bluetooth connectivity. Thankfully, the brand has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr5-2021-review">BTR5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr7-review">BTR7</a> if you want Bluetooth DACs, and both are highly regarded; I use the BTR7 extensively. And now, there&apos;s a new entrant in this segment: the BTR15.</p><p>Although the naming convention suggests the BTR15 should be the flagship offering, it is an updated model of the BTR5 that has a ton of enticing features. It shares the same design as the BTR5, but you get a larger OLED panel, updated Bluetooth modem with Bluetooth 5.1, and the ability to deliver up to 340mW of power, which is more than the BTR7.</p><p>The best part? The BTR15 retails for just $109, which is lower than the launch price of the BTR5.</p>

<p>Fiio launched the BTR15 back in October 2023, and the DAC is now available globally. Over in the U.S., the DAC is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-BTR15-Headphone-Resolution-Smartphones/dp/B0CM3NVGYL">for $109 on Amazon</a>, and you can pick it up from a variety of audio retailers. The DAC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/FIIO-BTR15-Bluetooth-Headphone-Amplifier-Black/dp/B0CM3NVGYL">costs £114 in the U.K.</a>, and in India, it is available for ₹9,999 ($120).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y4UuhDCDYECa6opM9CTUXB" name="fiio-btr15-4.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4UuhDCDYECa6opM9CTUXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio really doesn&apos;t like changing the design of its products between generations, and as a result, the BTR15 shares a lot of design similarities to the BTR5. Both have the same aesthetic with dual curved sides — similar to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> — and there&apos;s glass coating the front and back panels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ezL5uoVNeKvtuPbQUKGDVD" name="fiio-btr15-14.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ezL5uoVNeKvtuPbQUKGDVD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the chassis is constructed out of aluminum, and the build quality is exquisite. The design itself is rather elegant, and it gives the BTR15 a sense of refinement that belies its price tag. I used the DAC for the better part of three months, and I didn&apos;t see any issues with the build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qjzXBKuMc3btjmgmtciVTC" name="fiio-btr15-8.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qjzXBKuMc3btjmgmtciVTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 37.3g, the BTR15 is small enough that you can just carry it in your pocket, and the diminutive size makes it a great choice. It is a smidgen narrower and thicker than the BTR5, but other than that, the design is fundamentally unchanged.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QpvL4FKQgvSD7QDBWFDwpD" name="fiio-btr15-17.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QpvL4FKQgvSD7QDBWFDwpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get all the buttons on the right, and there is a lot to cover. There&apos;s the power button, multifunction button, volume rocker, and a toggle that lets you switch between Bluetooth, PC, and phone modes. The buttons are tiny, but they have good tactile feedback.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-connectivity-you-need-2">All the connectivity you need</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="noMXrXxMx45EEjmg3bK2bC" name="fiio-btr15-9.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noMXrXxMx45EEjmg3bK2bC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key difference over the BTR5 is that the BTR15 has a 4.4mm port alongside the standard 3.5mm port. The BTR5 had a 2.5mm port for the balanced connection, but with the inclusion of a 4.4mm port, you can use the BTR15 with a significantly wider range of products, including headsets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sVkucrvVWPuBMX5NKTJh2C" name="fiio-btr15-6.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sVkucrvVWPuBMX5NKTJh2C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can connect the BTR15 with your phone via Bluetooth or USB-C, and the DAC uses Qualcomm&apos;s QCC5125 modem, offering Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity. This is the same modem that&apos;s used in costlier DACs like the Q15 and K9, so it&apos;s great to see Fiio bringing it to a budget product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SsjT2YDNh55RjXZbG4whnC" name="fiio-btr15-10.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SsjT2YDNh55RjXZbG4whnC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to greater range, the QCC5125 unlocks high-res audio codecs; you get LDAC along with the full suite of AptX codecs, including AptX, AptX LL, AptX Adaptive, and AptX HD. The BTR15 has a 550mAh battery, and it lasts just over six hours in LDAC mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vi2m4kGLzfgdaKDRahovAD" name="fiio-btr15-12.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vi2m4kGLzfgdaKDRahovAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another major difference is the screen; the BTR15 has a larger 0.96-inch OLED panel, and it has higher contrast text, making it easy to read outdoors. You can use the screen to navigate the settings, including adjusting the gain, tweaking the EQ, switching to the built-in car mode, and a whole lot more. You can also use the Fiio Control app to change all the setting.</p>
<p>The default screen shows the mode currently in use, volume level, gain, and battery indicator. The screen gives the BTR15 a distinct edge over the KA series of dongle DACs.</p>
<h2 id="outstanding-sound-2">Outstanding sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uikajJgxmAAzWZ2Jjvn9xA" name="fiio-btr15-1.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uikajJgxmAAzWZ2Jjvn9xA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BTR15 features dual ESS ES9219MQ DACs, and the USB side of things is handled by an XMOS XU316. It goes up to 384kHz/32-bit over PCM and has DSD256, but it&apos;s the power on offer that makes it stand out against the BTR5 and even the BTR7.</p><p>The BTR15 manages to deliver 165mW of power at 16Ω and 125mW at 32Ω over the 3.5mm port, and it goes up to 270mW at 16Ω and 340mW at 32Ω when using the balanced 4.4mm port. It is more powerful than the BTR7 in this regard, and it is able to drive just about any IEM in the market, as well as planar headsets like the FT5.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VTcrKz77pmSVkFTdYU9DHC" name="fiio-btr15-7.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VTcrKz77pmSVkFTdYU9DHC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the BTR15 has the same clean sound that&apos;s a characteristic of the brand&apos;s budget DACs, and you get a slight hint of warmth that makes using it enjoyable. I tested the DAC with the Fiio FX15 and FT5, and both proved to be good pairings; the BTR15 was able to deliver a vibrant bass with good texture, unlocking the potential of the FX15. The mid-range is natural and has plenty of clarity, with vocals coming through with good articulation.</p><p>The treble is detailed and airy, and the biggest difference between the BTR5 is that the BTR15 has better resolution overall.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-btr15-what-i-didn-t-like"><span>Fiio BTR15: What I didn't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C4YpePvYiGsQDj6ZaotF2E" name="fiio-btr15-15.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4YpePvYiGsQDj6ZaotF2E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There really isn&apos;t much to criticize with the BTR15. The only quibble I have with the design is that the glass panels tend to smudge easily, and the back is prone to scratches if you carry it around in your pocket. This can be mitigated by using the bundled clear case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C6hEUSGjdnw7PLvpsYtQgD" name="fiio-btr15-16.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6hEUSGjdnw7PLvpsYtQgD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BTR5 had a nifty option to use NFC to connect to phones easily, and that&apos;s missing on the BTR15. It isn&apos;t a huge omission by itself, but it was a cool feature. Also, you don&apos;t get a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box any longer; with the iPhone 15 models switching over to USB-C, Fiio has decided to bundle just a USB-C cable and a USB-A dongle in the package, so if you&apos;re using an older iPhone, you will need to source a small USB-C to Lightning cable.</p>
<p>There&apos;s no fast charging, so even though the BTR15 has a small 550mAh battery, it takes nearly two hours to charge the DAC. My Magic 6 Pro has a battery that&apos;s nearly ten times larger, and it takes just under an hour to charge. Obviously, the BTR15 is designed to be used for much longer than a phone, and it makes sense that Fiio wants to prolong battery life, but fast charging of up to 10W would have made a difference — right now, it only goes up to 5W. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-btr15-should-you-buy-it"><span>Fiio BTR15: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FVnEYMn6vanXod8BW4tDhB" name="fiio-btr15-5.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVnEYMn6vanXod8BW4tDhB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a Bluetooth DAC with plenty of power</li><li>You need a balanced 4.4mm port</li><li>You want good battery life</li><li>You need a DAC that's easily pocketable</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want fast charging</li></ul>
<p>Having switched to the BTR15 from the BTR5 and BTR7, it&apos;s easy to tell that Fiio is onto a winner. The DAC delivers a clean sound and retains a lot of the same tonal characteristics as the BTR7, and the increased power on offer makes it a better choice if you&apos;re interested in a Bluetooth DAC to use with a headset.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the value to consider. At $109, the BTR15 is the best value in the brand&apos;s DAC portfolio as of writing. It manages to outmatch the BTR5 considerably, and has notable wins against the costlier BTR7, and that&apos;s no small feat.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The mid-range or sub-$500 smartphone segment continues to be a bustling one especially in price-sensitive markets like India. Realme has managed to carve a niche for itself here by continually delivering new offerings with improved specs and great designs. The latter aspect has always been the brand&apos;s signature recipe for any new smartphone, and that’s still going strong in 2024. </p><p>The Realme 12 series is the latest number offering from the Chinese brand and already, we have about five different models ranging from $150 to about $400. The one on test today is the Realme 12 Plus 5G, which sits somewhere in the middle of the pack and yet, manages to cram some pretty impressive features. </p><p>Realme claims it’s the first in the segment to get a 50MP Sony LYT-600 main camera sensor, along with IP54 water resistance with “Rainwater Smart Touch” treatment for the display, and a 120Hz AMOLED display with incredibly high peak brightness. These features, coupled with a sophisticated design and aggressive pricing makes it a very tempting proposition. It’s time to find out if you should indeed consider it over the competition. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R8CvJWS6S3ZjFJzgDHNJiA" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-9.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R8CvJWS6S3ZjFJzgDHNJiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G is available in many Southeast Asian countries like India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. I received the Indian retail unit of the top-end variant, priced at Rs. 21,999 ($265), which comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The base variant isn’t much cheaper at Rs. 20,999 ($253) and has the same amount of RAM but 128GB of storage. Needless to say, you should get the 256GB variant directly if you&apos;re considering this phone, as it’s the best value for money. </p><p>The 12 Plus 5G comes in two colors, Pioneer green and Navigator beige. The latter is more of a neutral shade and will go well with any attire, but the green variant certainly has its own charm and looks equally striking. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-realme-12-plus-5g-what-i-like"><span>Realme 12 Plus 5G: What I like </span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKTCnkoWp8GYj5CpfbfoYP" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-7.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKTCnkoWp8GYj5CpfbfoYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The entire 12 series is built around the same design language in partnership with luxury watch designer Ollivier Savéo. The single, circular rear camera dial, vegan leather back panel, and the diamond-patterned stripe running vertically through the center of the phone are all said to be inspired by luxury watches. The Pro models in the series get more intricate patterns, but for what it costs, I think the Realme 12 Plus looks stylish and unique. The faux leather back also means there’s no worry of cracks if you drop it or ugly fingerprint smudges. </p><p>The phone doesn’t feel too heavy at 190g despite packing a large display and battery. Realme has included a headphone jack for those who still prefer wired audio, and the second slot of the dual-SIM tray can accommodate a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> if you need more storage. The Redmi 12 Plus is also IP54-rated for dust and water resistance, which is a big deal in this segment. It’s not waterproof, but it should easily survive a heavy drizzle or light splashes of water. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CnAJ9pa2caaVNkLUzzppEo" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-5.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CnAJ9pa2caaVNkLUzzppEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display on the Realme 12 Plus is also very good for its segment. It’s a flat 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with a FHD+ (2,400x1,080) resolution and a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate. The protective glass has 3D-curved edges all around so it’s gentle on your fingers when performing gestures. Color reproduction is vibrant and the screen has a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits (600 nits typical). </p><p>Thanks to this, content was always easily visible, even under the harsh Mumbai summer heat. The vibrancy of colors can be adjusted in the Settings app, but I found the default Vivid profile to be quite accurate. I also didn’t notice any major color shift when viewing the display off-axis, which is a good sign.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VzKwuTMbkJ52mgyyZQ4Qf7" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-12.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VzKwuTMbkJ52mgyyZQ4Qf7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 12 Plus 5G’s display also gets something called a Rainwater Smart Touch feature. This is supposed to maintain accurate touch response even when water falls on the display and also keeps the in-display fingerprint reader functional with moist fingers. </p><p>This kind of works to an extent, but not always. For instance, the display still registers phantom touches when placed under running water, but once removed, it’s actually usable even with big droplets still on the screen. Using the fingerprint sensor in such conditions was hit or miss, as it worked sometimes but struggled to register otherwise.  </p>

<p>The performance of the Realme 12 Plus 5G has been a smooth affair in the two weeks I’ve been using it. It’s backed by a decently powerful MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC, which is a bit more potent than a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 but on par or little behind something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a> in benchmarks. </p><p>If you’re a casual mobile gamer like myself, then you’ll enjoy playing games like Asphalt 9: Legends or Call of Duty Mobile (with low to medium graphics) on the 12 Plus. The visuals are great, the framerate is generally solid, and the sound from the stereo speakers will keep you engaged for hours. Some portion of the frame and the rear camera bump get a bit warm after, say, 30 minutes of playing, but never overly hot. The screen has a standard 240Hz touch sampling rate, which I found to be adequate. </p>

<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G worked well on the 5G networks here in India. The phone supports a total of nine 5G bands, some of which are also supported by all the major U.S. carriers, which means you can easily use the phone on your travels to the U.S. NFC is not present, but you get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.</p>
<p>Battery life is quite impressive, too, with the 5,000mAh capacity easily lasting for up to two full days on one charge. Even with a bit of gaming and heavy camera testing, I was still able to go past one full day of use. The 12 Plus 5G can also be charged quickly, thanks to 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging. In practice, you can get a 50 percent charge in just under 20 minutes. The best thing about Realme phones is that the charger comes bundled in the box. </p>

<p>The primary camera on the Realme 12 Plus 5G is pretty good for the segment. The 50MP Sony LYT-600 sensor is optically stabilized (OIS) and has an aperture of f/1.9. Photos are saved at roughly 12.5MP resolution by default, but you can take a full 50MP photo if you need to. Landscapes and close-up photos generally have good sharpness, vivid colors, and decent details in daylight. The ultrawide also manages some decent shots here under bright sunlight. Low-light shots from the main camera are fairly detailed, autofocus is quick, and you can get away with shooting single-handed in Night mode (with a one-second delay) thanks to OIS.</p>

<p>The large sensor also lets you do a 2x lossless zoom (in-sensor crop). Some interesting shooting modes include Street, which lets you toggle an auto-zoom feature. Once you tap your subject, the app tries to aesthetically frame the shot by zooming in on it. You also get the usual selection of shooting modes like slow-mo, timelapse, etc. The 12 Plus 5G can also shoot videos up to 4K 30fps, but without any stabilization.</p>

<p>Apart from the main camera on the 12 Plus 5G, the rest are pretty run-of-the-mill sensors that fail to impress. The rear camera dials make it look like there are four cameras, but one of them is just a dummy to complete the symmetry. The 8-megapixel ultrawide camera fares well in daylight, with minimal barrel distortion, but colors and details are weak compared to the main camera. In low light, Night mode helps maintain a decent exposure, but peek a bit closer, and you&apos;ll notice colors and details are simply lacking. </p><p>There’s a 2MP macro camera in the dial, too, but it’s not great and best left unused. Sadly, the 16MP selfie camera isn’t much to shout about either. You can expect passable selfies under good lighting but average ones in low light. There’s a screen flash to assist in low-light shots, but it can only do so much. </p><p>The quality of recorded video is fairly average too from the ultrawide camera. You can only record up to 1080p 30fps with it, but if you begin recording with the main camera at this resolution, there’s no way to switch to the ultrawide mid-shooting. </p>

<p>My main gripe with the 12 Plus 5G is the bloated nature of Realme UI 5.0 itself. It’s a derivation of Oppo’s ColorOS, which has also received touches of OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS along the way. This version is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and Realme claims that it will get three years of software updates. Unfortunately, there are simply way too many redundant and spammy apps that are preinstalled, and even when you first set up the phone, it feels like someone has been using it for a month.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eVXhDNnYjDhx5sxi8vfLti" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-13.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVXhDNnYjDhx5sxi8vfLti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also have to be mindful to skip suggested app installs during initial setup, or else you’ll be saddled with even more apps before you even begin. What makes it worse is the non-stop notifications from some of them that clutter your notification shade. Thankfully, you can minimize this by disabling most of the suggestions within the apps, but it’s still annoying having to deal with it in the first place. </p><p>My other little niggle is with the phone’s always-on display (AOD) feature or the fact that you can’t exactly have it <em>always </em>on. There’s usually an option to enable this, but it’s absent from the 12 Plus 5G. This means the AOD disappears if you place the phone down and only activates again if you get a notification or move it a bit. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PK56W2NooPPNptFkpMab44" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-14.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PK56W2NooPPNptFkpMab44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, the 12 Plus 5G is a large phone and while that 190g of total weight is distributed well, the flat nature of the frame is not the most comfortable to hold and use, especially with one hand. The glossy finish of the side rail is also a pain to keep clean and as it attracts dust and fingerprints almost immediately. </p>

<p>As impressive as the features are of the Realme 12 Plus for its segment, there are other players with equally impressive rivals. The Poco X6 5G starts at roughly the same price but offers double the storage, and it even has a 512GB variant with 12GB of RAM for not much more. It packs a more potent Snapdragon SoC and Gorilla Glass Victus, while staying competitive in all other areas with Realme. </p><p>The iQoo Z9 is another recent offering with a feature set similar to the 12 Plus 5G. It, too, features a very capable Sony main camera sensor and a more power-efficient 4nm MediaTek SoC. </p>
<p>Realme’s own premium models are not too far off, either. By spending a bit more, you can get the Realme 12 Pro 5G, which has a more premium design, curved-edge display, a better chipset, and a portrait camera with 2x optical zoom. There’s also the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a> which has the unique transparent back with programmable notification lights and superb all-round performance. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want a unique-looking phone without spending a lot   </li><li>You want certified water resistance </li><li> You want a vivid display and great battery life  </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want a lean version of Android </li><li> You want quality selfie and ultrawide cameras </li><li> You play a lot of heavy games  </li></ul>
<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G is a solid budget offering that checks off most of the boxes if you’re shopping in this segment. Design has always been one of Realme’s strong suits, and it’s on full display here. The vegan leather finish and luxury watch-inspired camera dial on the back is sure to turn heads, as it makes it look more expensive than it actually is. It’s also water resistant, supports expandable storage, and has a headphone jack. The performance is decent, the display is bright and punchy, the battery life is great, and the main camera is reliable no matter the time of day. </p><p>A couple of things that you might not like is the annoying fluff in Realme UI. The redundant apps and their tendency to spam you with ads and unsolicited suggestions get annoying very quickly. The secondary cameras could have been a lot better, too, especially in low light. Finally, if you’re in the U.S., then you’re out of luck trying to get this. In fact, Realme hasn’t yet launched the 12 series outside a handful of Southeast Asian countries. Not to worry, as there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">good cheap Android phones</a> that are more easily accessible. </p>
