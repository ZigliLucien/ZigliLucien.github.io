<ul><li>Android 15's code offers more details on the software's upcoming "quarantine app" feature.</li><li>The code suggests that the software's service, like Play Protect, could be responsible for quarantining a malicious or "misbehaving" app to protect users.</li><li>A quarantined app can no longer offer notifications, ring the device, and many other features that have become commonplace.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Shortly after the start of Android 15&apos;s first beta, signs in its code seem to point toward a new "quarantine" feature for rogue applications.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-quarantine-apps-3434663/">Android Authority</a>), Google appears to be working on a new quarantine feature that isolates an app that could be dangerous. Rahman noted that quarantining an app in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> functions similarly to disabling an app in Settings or suspending it through Digital Wellbeing.</p><p>In testing, the safety protocol will still display the app&apos;s existence on your home screen; however, it will disable all notifications from it. Pre-existing instances (windows/activities) of the app will be "hidden" and it also loses its ability to ring your Android device.</p><p>Rahman discovered that a quarantined app cannot "receive broadcasts" from the OS or other apps on a device. Furthermore, services cannot query it, but it seems that the app&apos;s activities still can.</p><p>Google is likely working on a new "QUARANTINE_APPS" permission toggle for users to grant services like Play Protect. This could mean that Android will be responsible for confining apps away from the rest of a user&apos;s system.</p><p>It&apos;s still unclear if this app quarantine feature will drop with Android 15 or some time after. Rahman states that neither Play Protect nor the Play Store have the appropriate feature at this time. Once available and when called to action, Android 15 may alert users that it has quarantined an app "for your safety."</p>

<p>Google&apos;s Android 15 development continues as the software crossed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">first beta milestone</a> on April 11. The beta&apos;s opening allows eligible Pixel owners and more developers in on the software&apos;s testing to begin preparing apps for its official launch. The first beta included additional assistance for app creators developing products for large devices like foldables.</p><p>The company also included support for app archiving and unarchiving, while improving TalkBack&apos;s support for braille displays.</p><p>According to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/overview#timeline">development timeline</a>, Google&apos;s first beta timing arrived right on schedule. Interested testers are in for a couple more betas before Android 15 moves into "Platform Stability" toward the summer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>From the moment my son learned his new smartwatch had the Dinosaur Game — yes, the one from Chrome that everyone loves — he was hooked. While the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch isn&apos;t designed to play games all day, there&apos;s no denying how the right feature can get you to immediately love a product from the moment you first try it.</p><p>Thankfully, the rest of the experience on the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch lived up to the initial impressions. Everything from the powerful parental monitoring app to the simple watch UI works well — although I&apos;d argue that the phone app could be slightly more intuitive — and it sits well atop the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">best kids smartwatches</a>.</p><p>If the watch has one particular negative, it&apos;s that it <em>only</em> works on T-Mobile&apos;s network. No Wi-Fi support means you&apos;ll always need to keep a line on your plan just for the watch.</p><p>We&apos;ve seen some customer reviews mention that the watch doesn&apos;t hold up over time, but that wasn&apos;t a problem for the boys who tested it for Android Central. If you&apos;re concerned about durability, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=syncup+kids+watch+screen+protector&crid=1AABI0CNFIXBB&sprefix=syncup+%2Caps%2C236&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_7">Amazon sells</a> several different kinds of protectors to keep it looking new. So far, though, the preinstalled screen protector has been all we needed.</p><p>Chris Wedel originally reviewed the watch for Android Central back in 2021, so I&apos;m taking another look at it in 2024 after T-Mobile has made some notable updates and changes over the years.</p>

<p>The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/commerce/smart-watch/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch">sold exclusively through T-Mobile</a>. T-Mobile offers the watch for free when you add a new watch line to your account. Otherwise, the watch is $174 at full price. A watch line on T-Mobile typically costs $10 per month.</p><p>The watch only comes in one color, black, but it ships with two watch bands in the box, so you can change the colors up a bit. The included cloth band is black with teal edges, while the clasping silicone band is all black.</p><p>You&apos;ll also find a charger and pamphlets inside the box. A film screen protector is preinstalled on the watch and can help keep the display from getting scratched for a while. If you&apos;re concerned about durability, you can grab a pack of screen protectors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-SyncUp-Protector-Anti-Scratch-Sensitive/dp/B09WRCR8HP">from Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Since our original review was published in 2021, T-Mobile has updated the watch with some very important feature updates. Chief among these is the addition of video calling and scheduled school mode, both of which were complaints in our original review.</p><p>When enabled, school mode disables games, the camera, sounds, the alarm clock, and task reminders. It can be set up on a simple schedule or manually enabled. I found this invaluable, as my son would inevitably get distracted and begin playing the aforementioned dinosaur game while he was at school, causing some obvious problems among the other students.</p><p>The watch&apos;s new video calling feature was quite good in my testing, although video availability depends on signal strength. Thankfully, the video frame rate will be slowed down to accommodate signal strength and will automatically be turned off in areas with poor signal. It works exactly as you would expect and can be activated from the watch or from the parents&apos; app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.87%;"><img id="E2h8AS65m77YVBkTLM9ETG" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-Kids-watch-screenshots-health-calls-tracking.jpg" alt="Screenshots from the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch phone app showing step tracking, video calling, and real-time location tracking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E2h8AS65m77YVBkTLM9ETG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2199" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Communicating with my son via video or voice calls is dead simple. Calls can be initiated from the watch or the SyncUP phone app. Audio calls and text messages use carrier voice and SMS messaging services, while video calling is handled through the SyncUP app on your phone. Kids can only call or message whoever you&apos;ve put on their contact list</p><p>While T-Mobile hasn&apos;t improved the keyboard from the watch&apos;s initial release, my son preferrs using the built-in voice messaging feature anyway. He&apos;s familiar with this type of functionality from using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a>, but he can always use any of the available emojis, premade messages, or even take a picture if he needs to tell me something a different way.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Setup was dead simple, and calls and messaging couldn't be easier to use.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The watch&apos;s form factor is similar to that of many other kids&apos; watches, with its thick, square design. It&apos;s made entirely of plastic—including the display—so it will survive a fall from most heights, even straight onto concrete. The downside to a plastic display is that it scratches easily, so make sure you have a screen protector on it to keep it from getting permanently scuffed up.</p><p>Navigation is handled entirely via the touch screen, but the side button can be used at any time to navigate back to the watch face. A satisfying zipping sound emits from the onboard speaker as you navigate, making navigation feel oddly tactile, considering there&apos;s no physical rotating crown. If the speaker gets tinny from getting wet, there&apos;s a built-in water ejection function that&apos;s particularly handy since this watch is fully IP68 water and dust-resistant.</p><p>The watch ships with a comfortable cloth wrist strap that is preinstalled and uses a simple Velcro-like fastening method. My son preferred this band over the rubberized one included in the box. Our previous reviewer&apos;s son preferred the other one but any standard 20mm watch band will work with the watch, that way you&apos;re not confined to just these two bands.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Virtual boundaries and video calls made me feel safe while my son was out and about.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The charger that ships with the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch is impressively well-built and designed. It uses a USB-C plug to connect to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">favorite USB-C charger</a>, and POGO pins connect strongly to the watch itself. Unlike some other smartwatches, I never ran into a situation where the watch didn&apos;t charge when I put it on the charger.</p><p>On average, I found the watch boasted a 2-day battery life under normal use. That included a few gaming and messaging sessions throughout the day, but gaming or using the built-in real-time tracking feature will drain your battery quite quickly.</p><p>Thankfully, the watch has a built-in safety mechanism that shuts off gaming and other battery-draining features once it gets below 20%.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EcVfNUyZ926j2jyb6D23uc" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-KIDS-Watch-pairing-with-app.jpg" alt="Syncing the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch with the app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EcVfNUyZ926j2jyb6D23uc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Within the companion app, you can look at your child&apos;s activity and see their step count for the day or view their history. You can also set up a step goal for your child to encourage them to keep going. My son enjoys this part as it helps him feel like he reached an important goal every day.</p><p>From the SyncUP KIDS app, parents can create alarms and tasks. This helps keep my son on task with homework and chores and reminds him when it is time to get ready for bed. While there isn&apos;t a points reward system like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gabb-watch-review">Gabb Watch</a> or Garmin Bounce have, you can include a reward message that&apos;s automatically sent when they complete a task.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.71%;"><img id="F4Yw49yx3XDSrfDgmcNNEG" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-Kids-watch-screenshots-chores-permissions-school-mode.jpg" alt="Screenshots from the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch phone app showing the chores list, permissions, and school mode feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F4Yw49yx3XDSrfDgmcNNEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2907" height="1416" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The login for the app is the same as you&apos;d have for your T-Mobile account, and you can enable biometrics if you prefer a quicker app sign-in.</p><p>The app does a good job of making the process of adding the watch easy. After adding in your child&apos;s info, you can input the contacts you approve of your child communicating with. Setting my wife up as another parental user on the watch was as easy as putting her phone number in the invite section and having her go through the sign-up process.</p>

<p>I&apos;m happy to see that the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch supports geofencing in what is called Virtual Boundaries.</p><p>The app will notify you once the watch enters the designated area. Chris Wedel used this often for his son during school days, letting him know when his son arrived and left school. This feature can help ease a parent&apos;s mind as their child begins to have more and more experiences away from home. An emergency contact button and 911 dialing are also available as added safety options.</p><p>Aside from the automated location alerts that can be set up, parents can also manually locate their child using the app or even turn on live tracking. This will ping the watch every 10 seconds for a maximum of 15 minutes. However, keep in mind that using this feature will quickly deplete the watch&apos;s battery life.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>My son loved the included dino game and step tracking but was hoping for some more available apps.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The camera can also take silly pictures that your child can store on the watch and later send as messages. The quality is good enough for a watch and generally looks great on the watch face. It&apos;s nice being able to receive pictures like this, as it makes spontaneous moments fun.</p><p>The app situation is also pretty barebones, but that&apos;s not bad if the goal is to reduce distractions. The apps are limited to step tracking, the camera, a media folder, communications, timers, a calculator, and a few games. The games available are few and simple: Tic Tac Toe, Puzzle, Voice Changer, and Dino Run.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-what-needs-work"><span>T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch: What needs work</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-KIDS-Watch-home-screen.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the watch does a good job of managing battery in poor cellular coverage areas, it would be helpful if it had the option of Wi-Fi calling or messaging. The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch lacks any connectivity option other than the 4G LTE.</p><p>The device utilizes the cellular network to manage calls and texts as they come through normal SMS, and when the network connection is poor, it&apos;s going to obviously struggle.</p><p>Supporting Wi-Fi would not only help in this regard but also prolong the life of the watch itself. Having poor network coverage means the watch will constantly waste battery searching for an LTE signal, and it also means you can&apos;t use the watch&apos;s vital communication features unless you&apos;re in range of a T-Mobile tower.</p><p>The network availability could also deter potential users from this smartwatch. Even though T-Mobile has substantially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-t-mobile-everything-you-need-know">expanded its network</a>, that mostly applies to 5G signals which this watch doesn&apos;t support.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Having no Wi-Fi support means the watch could suffer from poor indoor network coverage.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While I don&apos;t necessarily need it, some customers have asked about the possibility of getting popular messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp on the watch. Watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.angelwatchco.com/kb/messaging-and-the-line-slash-lite-lite-app/understanding-messaging-on-angel-watch">Angel Watch</a> support WhatsApp, which is more widely used worldwide for communication. This isn&apos;t as important for a U.S.-only watch, but it would still be nice to have some more options.</p><p>I also find the app UI to be a little confusing, partly because it&apos;s fairly slow to load. You have to find the watch in the list of family members on the app home screen to open watch options. Tapping the watch thumbnail on the main map screen does nothing, which was very strange to me. Once I figured out how to find the watch, things were OK, but this step was needlessly confusing.</p><p>Lastly, I&apos;d love to see more health sensors on a future version of the watch. Step counting is nice, but most adult smartwatches support things like heart rate monitoring, stress monitoring, and more. It would be nice to have this on a kids watch like the Angel Watch Series R has.</p>

<p>If the watch features or network capabilities are reasons to give you pause when considering the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch, don&apos;t worry. The options for connected kids&apos; smartwatches are plentiful. My son&apos;s favorite smartwatch is also our top pick: the Garmin Bounce. While it doesn&apos;t have the dino game or a camera, it&apos;s got even better battery life than the SyncUP, a points reward system, and Wi-Fi support.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a watch with even better cameras, the TickTalk 4 has two cameras so your child take even more photos. It also supports video calling. While there aren&apos;t any games on this watch, it does have free iHeartRadio Family music. This, along with many other features, can be limited or turned off within the TickTalk companion app. The downside is that it&apos;s missing geofencing support.</p><p>Our other choice is the Angel Watch Series R. While the app is clunkier than what&apos;s offered by the T-Mobile SyncUP, the Angel Watch supports WhatsApp for richer communication. In addition, a series of health sensors make it possible to monitor heart rate and other health data throughout the day, making it one of the only kids&apos; watches with more advanced health features.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if ...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a watch with great communication options.</li><li>You want a watch with good safety features.</li><li>You are a T-Mobile customer.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if ...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You live in an area with poor T-Mobile coverage.</li><li>You want a watch with health sensors.</li><li>You want a watch that supports 3rd-party apps.</li></ul>
<p>The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch would be my pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">best kids smartwatch</a> if it were offered outside of the confines of T-Mobile&apos;s network. While you&apos;re not likely to find too many places with poor T-Mobile network coverage these days, being restricted to a single LTE network is strangely confining, especially when there&apos;s no Wi-Fi support to help with coverage in buildings.</p><p>But, if you&apos;re a T-Mobile customer or looking to join T-Mobile&apos;s excellent network, this is a superb option that&apos;ll only cost you $10/month since the company gives the watches away for free with a new watch line.</p><p>It offers nearly every feature you could think of or want — except for a points reward system for chores and tasks — and includes excellent voice and video calling, plus lots of text and voice messaging options. The setup is super simple, and everything is handled through your T-Mobile login. All in all, it&apos;s a superb choice for anyone on T-Mobile, so long as you don&apos;t have issues with indoor reception.</p>

<p>Verizon is knocking up to half off eco-friendly accessories in their web store, with plenty of cases, chargers, and more up for grabs. Keep in mind that "eco-friendly" here means that the accessories are constructed partially from recycled materials. Certain products, like chargers, are designated as eco-friendly because they're energy efficient. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/products/eco-friendly/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="67308e7d-fe69-42b5-8db3-06aaa080a416" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Up to 50% off eco-friendly accessories at Verizon" data-dimension48="Up to 50% off eco-friendly accessories at Verizon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="why-should-i-shop-for-refurbished-tech-2">Why should I shop for refurbished tech?</h2>
<p>Recycled materials and plastic-free packaging are all well and good, but if you really want an eco-friendly gadget, the best thing you could do is buy used or refurbished. Buying one of these pre-owned devices completely removes the costly manufacturing process altogether, thereby reducing your environmental impact considerably. It also (hopefully) tells the tech companies that they don&apos;t necessarily need to roll out a new device every single year for the rest of our lives.</p><p>Everyone from Samsung to Amazon and Back Market have an excellent selection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">refurbished phones</a> and other devices that have been renewed to meet like-new standards. In most cases, they&apos;re are also covered by a warranty and are dramatically cheaper than their brand new counterparts. In other words, it can help the environment <em>and</em> your bank account at the same time. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-greenwashing-2">What is greenwashing?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, greenwashing is a deceitful marketing tactic that merchants use to make consumers believe that they&apos;re supporting a sustainable business, even when the company in question has done very little or nothing to actually reduce their environmental impact. Just about every market is guilty of it nowadays, and it&apos;s up to you, the consumer, to spot the sketchy strategy before you spend your hard-earned money. </p><p>One piece of advice would be to keep an eye out for companies that use vague buzzwords like "green", "earth-friendly", and even "eco-friendly". Unless they&apos;re accompanied with certifications and transparent, verifiable business practices, these claims have no substantial backing. </p><p>Similarly, be wary of distractions. A phone shipped out with 100% recycled exterior packaging is great, but it has very little impact when the company takes part in environmentally-destructive practices elsewhere in the manufacturing process. As a rule of thumb, explore the company&apos;s website and find their sustainability policies and goals before adding any product to your cart. If they&apos;re vague, unspecific, or non-existent, it&apos;s probably greenwashing. </p><p>Although they don&apos;t exactly have a spotless environmental record, you can also take a look at our guide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-samsungs-galaxy-for-the-planet-initiative">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy For The Planet initiative</a> to see how one major tech company is attempting to tackle the climate crisis. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, a lot of the best T-Mobile phones also double up as some of the best phones in general, but that doesn&apos;t always mean it&apos;s easy to choose one. Whether you&apos;re a new customer or have been with the carrier for many years, there are quite a few great options worth checking out, and we&apos;ve rounded up the best among them to help you out.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing to consider while choosing a good Android phone is to ensure that it offers all the features you need, at a price you can afford. Our top vote goes to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra because it&apos;s the ultimate flagship that has just about every feature you could think of. Alternatively, you can go for the Google Pixel 8 as it offers a wide variety of flagship perks at a very reasonable price. Then we have budget options like the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, which includes all the essentials and even has some features that you won&apos;t find on much more expensive devices.</p>

It&apos;s now priced at just $349 and for that price, you&apos;re getting a smartphone that features Google&apos;s efficient Tensor G2 SoC (the same chipset found in the last-gen Pixel 7 Pro), a flagship-level camera quality, and some of the finest haptics in this price bracket.</p><p>Since this is a Pixel phone, you can also look forward to top-tier software support. It won&apos;t be an exaggeration to say that Google has gone out of its way to transform the Pixel 7a into a premium mid-range device. There are even premium features such as an IP67 certification and wireless charging included in the mix.</p>

The Galaxy S24 has a refined design with flat edges that give it a squared-off look. You get a slightly bigger 6.2-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED panel, but due to even slimmer bezels, the phone&apos;s overall physical footprint has largely remained unchanged compared to the previous-gen model.</p><p>The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and comes with 8GB of RAM and up to 25GB of onboard storage.

<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, we finally have an ultra-premium foldable that ticks all the right boxes. Sure, it costs a fortune, but the moment you take a look at that gorgeous 7.6-inch folding Dynamic AMOLED screen, you might just think that the price is justified. This is a phone that&apos;s designed for side-by-side multitasking as it can easily pull double duty as a tablet whenever you need it to.</p><p>Of course, being a flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 offers the best when it comes to hardware. It&apos;s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and sports an awesome triple-lens rear camera setup.

<p>With the OnePlus 12, the company seems to have gotten its mojo back. Sure, it&apos;s not without its flaws, but there&apos;s a lot to like here. The phone&apos;s 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED display is, quite literally, one of its biggest highlights, as it can hit an incredible peak brightness of 4,500 nits. Not just that, &apos;Aqua Touch&apos; technology allows the screen to register touch input even when it&apos;s wet.</p><p>Powered by Qualcomm&apos;s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Gen SoC and up to 16GB of RAM, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12</a> excels at handling demanding tasks like heavy gaming. It also has an improved cooling system for better thermal efficiency. The phone comes with up to 512GB of internal storage and has an excellent triple-lens rear camera system. You get amazing battery life too, and the 5,400mAh battery can be charged at super-fast speeds.</p>

<h2 id="you-have-plenty-of-options-with-t-mobile-2">You have plenty of options with T-Mobile</h2>
<p>There&apos;s no doubting that T-Mobile&apos;s network infrastructure is one of the best you can get in the United States, featuring nationwide high-speed 5G coverage. However, you need one of the best T-Mobile phones to take advantage of the network and all of its perks. For the best performance, we suggest getting a phone that (at least) supports 5G bands n71 and n41.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that most users don&apos;t necessarily need top-tier devices such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> or the Google Pixel 8, even though they offer an unmatched user experience. If you want to save some cash, we suggest checking the Samsung Galaxy A54, the Google Pixel 7a, or even the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, all of which are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">best cheap Android phones</a> you can get.</p>

<p>In our opinion, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">Jabra Elite 10s</a> are the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> on the market today, and you can save $50 on them while this deal lasts. Buyers love the Elite 10s for their solid audio quality and features, like spatial audio and ANC. Plus, they're comfortable to wear, they offer up to 30 hours of battery life with the charging case, and they're rated IP57 for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are only a few left in gloss black and titanium black at Best Buy, though you can also get this deal on the cocoa and cream colors if you get there too late—or check them out from some other retailers.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want earbuds with premium audio and listening features, such as ANC, Dolby Atmos, and EQ presets; wireless charging is a major priority for you in headphones; you&apos;re looking for an especially comfortable pair of earbuds.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> ; you prefer bigger name-brand options like earbuds from Sony or Bose; you want hi-res codec support. </p><p>The Jabra Elite 10 earbuds feature powerful and clear audio from 10mm drivers, along with EQ presets, a useful, adaptive ANC, and beautiful spatial audio. The Jabra app also makes it easy to configure audio however you want, while built-in microphones let you talk on the phone or use voice assistants like Siri. On their own, these earbuds offer up to 8 hours of battery life, or up to a total of 30 hours with the use of the charging case.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the head tracking feature offers a pretty cool surround sound-like audio feature, though it can make the battery life drop pretty substantially. While they aren&apos;t as durable as the classic Jabra Elite 8 Active, they will still hold up pretty well compared to most earbuds.</p>

That hasn&apos;t stopped Google from preemptively "removing links to California news websites" and "pausing further investments in the California news ecosystem," according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/news/california-journalism-preservation-act-puts-news-ecosystem-at-risk/" target="_blank">sorrowful post</a> from Google News&apos; VP Jaffer Zaidi. </p><p>If this sounds familiar, it&apos;s because Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-response-canada-bill-c-18">blocked Canadian news sites</a> in response to a similar bill before eventually relenting with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-canada-bill-c-18-agreement">CA$100 million payout</a> to news organizations. It also had a similar showdown with Australia a few years back.</p><p>Google wants to nip this in the bud, showing the California State Assembly that it will happily kill California news sites to preempt this policy while pinning the blame on politicians. Because, like California&apos;s CCPA anti-cookie law, this "link tax" law would likely have nationwide implications for the internet if it succeeds (or fails) here.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Ju59Sqekeua2jvxr2GDQoT" name="Android-statue.jpg" alt="Android statues" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ju59Sqekeua2jvxr2GDQoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android statues at Google's Mountain View campus </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s main stated objection to the California Journalism Preservation Act is that it already helps "publishers of all sizes grow their audiences at no cost to them." It doesn&apos;t mention the reverse, that Google&apos;s entire business strategy involves making billions off of ad revenue for content <em>it</em> didn&apos;t pay for.</p><p>Local news publications, losing their print revenue, became fully dependent upon Google Search. Digital ad revenue wasn&apos;t enough to remain financially <em>in</em>dependent: many joined the California Newspapers Partnership, while others got bought up by billionaires, private equity groups, or nationwide conglomerates like Hearst. And all of them slashed their newsrooms down.</p><p>Zaidi says these same organizations would "use funds from CJPA to continue to buy up local California newspapers, strip them of journalists, and create more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/the-rise-of-the-ghost-newspaper/" target="_blank">ghost papers</a> that operate with a skeleton crew to produce only low-cost, and often low-quality, content." If that weren&apos;t already happening today, the prospect might be scarier. </p><p>Content farms already exist, all fighting for top placement in Google&apos;s SEO algorithm. It&apos;s typically been local journalism that loses to bigger sites that take and repackage original reporting with clickbait headlines, then rank higher on Google Search by default.</p><p>The CJPA, which requires a 70% investment of taxed funds in journalists, would presumably prevent these media groups from just taking Google&apos;s money from ghost papers for themselves. Even a pittance of Google&apos;s annual profits might keep these sites afloat, which would in turn help Google with its AI endeavors.</p><p>Instead, its no-California-websites strategy will bankrupt the few independent sources of news it has left since well-known brands like the LA Times are already struggling to survive.</p>
<h2 id="google-isn-apos-t-thinking-long-term-2">Google isn&apos;t thinking long-term</h2>
<p>Right now, Google Search typically gives its top results slot to either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-sponsored-ads-only-hurt-its-credibility">Sponsored ads</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> summary that repackages data from news sites instead of the featured snippets that highlight the site with the best answer. It technically cites sources, but most are hidden in auto-closed dropdown menus. </p><p>Once AI stops hallucinating and can provide quick answers to questions, it&apos;ll mean people don&apos;t have to hunt through multiple links to find the answer—which benefits Google in the short term. The problem is that the reduced traffic will bankrupt the sites that provide that information to Google, which will lobotomize its AI in the long run. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new Google Gemini AI app </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like any public tech company, Google&apos;s primary drive is maximizing shareholder profits. The "Killed by Google" trope became so prevalent because Google is unsentimental about casting aside projects (and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-lays-off-hundreds-in-ar-assistant-while-losing-fitbit-executives">own talent</a>), especially in recent years.</p><p>In executives&apos; eyes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-pay-publishers-1-billion-over-three-years-news-articles">Google News Showcase</a> and its $1 billion investment are more than generous, and they&apos;re the ones highlighting reputable news sources as more and more people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gen-z-search-using-tiktok-and-instagram-instead-of-google">turn to video-based news sources like TikTok and Instagram</a>. </p><p>In this context, only a law like the CJPA will motivate Google to compensate the websites that it <em>needs</em> to survive. Without it, Google will starve news organizations of what little revenue they have left, water down its Search results with unreliable AI data and sloppily researched newsers, and push younger generations to rely on video apps for news even more than they do now.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-case-against-the-cjpa-2">The *real* case against the CJPA</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5" name="New-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="X logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the virtue signaling about preserving journalism, the crux of Google&apos;s argument is buried near the end of Zaidi&apos;s post: That the CJPA in its current form "would create a level of business uncertainty that no company could accept." </p><p>Google and other aggregate sites don&apos;t want to add a new, variable operating cost to their earnings spreadsheets that might discourage shareholders from allowing them to continue linking to news sites. That&apos;s it.</p><p>A nationwide version of this bill, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA), prompted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-opposes-journalism-bill-that-would-harm-press-freedoms-and-free-speech-online" target="_blank">ACLU</a> to oppose it, saying that "by making platforms pay to access and display these facts, this legislation would make it harder for consumers to find news on social media, or in their search results. Platforms would likely choose not to link to news at all, or charge customers to view it."</p><p>I can certainly picture someone like Elon Musk making clickable links a Twitter Blue feature, hurting its status as a political town square for breaking news. While bigger sites like Google clearly have the money to pay news sites more, other sources might not have the same profitability to afford it. This could suppress news information in ways we can&apos;t predict. </p><p>In other words, I&apos;m not blindly saying that the CJPA is perfect or that companies aren&apos;t justified in trying to stop it and preserve the status quo that "works" now.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="M6HFoKyPCZeGYFyfkYRK5n" name="Google-logo-dark-illuminated-wide.jpg" alt="The Google Logo in Black and White under a sepia shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6HFoKyPCZeGYFyfkYRK5n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll freely admit to my own bias as a California-based journalist. This policy wouldn&apos;t affect me personally since Android Central&apos;s parent company isn&apos;t based here. However, it would affect the Bay Area newspapers my parents still diligently read every day or the single sources of local coverage that many small California cities have.</p><p>It&apos;s a near certainty that these people will begin losing their jobs, quickly. Before coming to Android Central, our new news editor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/nandika-ravi">Nandika Ravi</a>, was displaced from her previous job after her Ontario-based employer lost 33% of its traffic thanks to Instagram, Facebook, and Google banning Canadian links, subsequently laying off one-third of its staff shortly after the policy change. </p><p>She told me that the site, which used to cover seven cities in that province, had to cut local coverage for the smaller cities to stay afloat, and that the layoffs also hit larger news organizations, meaning those laid off wouldn&apos;t find any openings elsewhere. Finding remote work in another country was her only option. </p><p>At the time, Android Central&apos;s Jerry Hildenbrand wrote that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-and-canada-prove-that-doing-the-right-thing-sometimes-sucks-for-everyone">both Canada and Google were in the right</a>: Canada had the duty to prop up struggling news publications for the sake of a healthy, informed democracy, and Google had every right to refuse to pay for content when it can share free content from elsewhere.</p><p>That said, Google has become the successful monopoly it is today, in part, thanks to a very friendly California legislature that essentially let it form its own Mountain View fiefdom. To lash out at its home state and put Californian jobs and journalism in jeopardy to try and force friendly government policy is a bad look, if nothing else.</p><p>Whatever happens, Google&apos;s willingness to worsen its search results to keep hoarding its wealth is precisely why fewer people are willing to trust Search blindly these days. No one is "feeling lucky" anymore.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a couple of updates for Maps and Search that are designed to aid users in finding more sustainable ways to travel.</li><li>For Maps, users will find low-carbon travel alternatives alongside driving routes while Search picks up long-distance information for trains and buses.</li><li>Google is also bringing more awareness to emissions from flights for developers creating apps and websites.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ahead of Earth Day next week, Google is bringing a few updates to Maps and Search that may help users make better-informed choices around more "sustainable" methods of travel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> is set to pick up a feature that displays low-carbon alternatives when traveling. The company states users in Maps will soon find routes for walking and public transit alongside driving routes.</p><p>However, Google will only do this if "travel times are comparable and practical" so you won&apos;t be too delayed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:155.84%;"><img id="VqixVGEruz6yzHzrx3oCiF" name="google-maps-sustainable-travel-options-route.jpg" alt="Google is starting to show low-carbon alternatives for those traveling using Google Maps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqixVGEruz6yzHzrx3oCiF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="385" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These low-carbon alternatives will appear in "over fifteen cities" worldwide. This includes Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, Montreal, Paris, Rome, and Sydney. Google will begin rolling this feature out today (April 17) for Maps.</p><p>The second feature involves Google Search, as users can now inquire about long-distance trains and buses. For instance, the company says users can search for "Boston to Philadelphia train" and quickly discover schedules and ticket prices in a neat table below the search bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:368px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:163.04%;"><img id="eY38LLLn8zpqgAHxTqmeHT" name="google-search-long-distance-train-bus-routes.jpg" alt="Google Search will now offer information on schedules and tickets for long-distance trains and buses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eY38LLLn8zpqgAHxTqmeHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="368" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Search will provide links for users who need to book their tickets when selecting a result that best suits them. Joining this update, Google states it will add train route suggestions as an alternative when searching through the Flights app for a plane to catch.</p><p>Also rolling out today, users will find schedules for trains in 38 countries, including the U.S. For buses, Google is adding support to 15 countries, also including the U.S.</p><p>Google is also looking to increase awareness regarding airplane emissions. The post states that the company is bringing its Travel Impact Model (TIM) to its developer API. This will let app creators display flight emission information on their products or websites.</p><p>Additionally, developers can pick up a Google Sheets add-on and the TIM emissions calculator to help estimate a flight&apos;s amount per person. Google states this arrives as an additional tool alongside its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-google-travel-tips-and-tricks#section-get-the-best-deals-with-google-flights">Flights app</a>, which already displays such information for those who are curious.</p><p>These updates are rolling out today (Apr. 17) for users. If you&apos;re not yet seeing the features, give the app a little more time today and through the rest of the week.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps has new features for EV vehicle owners that provide them with useful information on their road trips.</li><li>Maps will provide accurate information about the EV charging points going forward.</li><li>It can include information such as the charging speed, what type of plug is used at the charging station, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps should help you find your electric vehicle charging station much easier on navigation as it is getting new features. These updates help users find information about the EV charging station and plan charging stops for road trips.</p><p>Google has announced that in the coming months, users can find AI-powered summaries in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, which describe an EV charger&apos;s specific location per user review so that they can easily spot the charging point. The example that the search giant cites is a multi-level parking lot, where finding the exact point can be tricky, and that is where the company&apos;s AI prowess comes into play.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:312px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:192.31%;"><img id="qXY8GD3VYJEoA7BvBqBZVD" name="google-maps-ai-summaries.jpg" alt="Google Maps AI Summaries" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXY8GD3VYJEoA7BvBqBZVD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="312" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The information is gathered from millions of user reviews on Google Maps, which will help pinpoint the charging spot for EV vehicle owners. Going forward, users can also witness additional details about which plug type will be available at such charging locations.</p><p>Moreover, finding EV charging information will be easier, especially when users&apos; vehicles are low on charge. Soon, users will be able to see nearby charges on "the in-car map" that showcases information like "real-time port availability and charging speed," notes Google in a press release. Users can expect the rollout to be global, particularly the vehicle owners with Google built-in in the coming months.</p>

<p>Another nifty addition comes to users when planning road trips, especially multi-stop ones. Google Maps will suggest suitable charging stops along the route, per the car battery&apos;s charge level. This new feature will also see the light of day globally in the coming months for vehicles with Google built-in.</p><p>Lastly, for users&apos; overnight stays during road trips, Google wants to save them from hunting for EV charging locations for the next morning; instead, it provides a new EV filter on the google.com/travel site where users can find hotels, which feature inside EV charging.</p><p>Google Maps recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-gets-three-new-updates">announced</a> three new updates for its users who plan trips, which included curated recommendations and customized lists. The latest release announced today is a plus for EV car owners to make their trip experience effortless. </p>

<ul><li>Starting in May, Visible will allow customers to <a href="https://www.visible.com/plans"><strong>pay for a full year of wireless service</strong></a> in advance instead of paying monthly. </li><li>Both of Visible's wireless plans are included in the update, with up to 26% in savings when you pre-pay for a full year. </li><li>This update comes only a month after <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/visibles-best-wireless-plan-just-got-even-better-without-raising-the-price">Visible upgraded its Plus plan</a> to include new perks at no additional cost. </li></ul>
<p>The Verizon-owned wireless carrier Visible Plus has been offering some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">our favorite data plans</a> for years now, but they somehow keep getting better. Starting in May, customers will be able to pay for a full year of wireless service in advance and receive up to 26% in savings. A full year of the basic Visible plan will cost $275 while 12 months of the Visible Plus plan will set you back $395 when you prepay. Since those two plans usually cost $25/month and $45/month, respectively, you could be looking at some serious savings. </p>

<p>Just a few weeks after rolling out an update that made their popular Plus plan even better, Visible has announced that they will begin offering annual payment options to new and existing wireless customers. Starting in May, pay for a full year in advance and you'll save 26% on the Visible Plus plan, no strings attached. </p>
<p>Both the Visible Basic plan and Visible Plus will remain otherwise unchanged, so if you prefer to pay monthly, you can continue to do so without any interruption. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ceb81ace-4bb7-417f-bd60-c6f93a630ada" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Save up to 26% when you pay for a full year of Visible in advance" data-dimension48="Save up to 26% when you pay for a full year of Visible in advance">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The best value here is obviously the Visible Plus plan. Paying for a full year in advance will save you a whopping $145, and you still get all of the monthly perks included in the plan, such as unlimited talk and text in over 30 countries worldwide, unlimited data on Verizon&apos;s Ultra Wideband 5G network, and 50GB of premium data every month.</p><p>Now that the March update has been implemented, the Visible Plus plan also comes with an unlimited mobile hotspot that&apos;s twice as fast as the basic Visible plan, and you&apos;ll get one Global Pass day per month (that&apos;s unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data across 140 countries).</p><p>If Visible wasn&apos;t home to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-mvno-deals-of-month-year-is-it-time-to-switch">best MVNO deals</a> before, it certainly is now. Will 2024 see more changes from the Verizon-powered wireless carrier? Only time will tell, but in the meantime, there&apos;s never been a better time to switch.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TECNO is emphasizing its camera-focused lineup with the launch of the Camon 30 Premier 5G.</li><li>The phone introduces TECNO's proprietary imaging system, promising groundbreaking features like 4K 30fps AI-noise reduction HDR video.</li><li>Beyond photography, the Camon 30 Premier excels in performance, with a large AMOLED display, MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate 5G chip, and ample RAM and storage options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO has finally launched the Camon 30 Premier 5G after showing it off during MWC 2024 in February, marking a big step for the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera-focused phone</a> lineup.</p><p>For the first time ever, the Camon 30 Premier 5G flaunts TECNO&apos;s very own imaging system. It&apos;s packing something TECNO claims is a game-changer, thanks to its 4K 30fps full-scene AI-noise reduction HDR video capability.</p><p>This means super crisp, detailed videos with true-to-life colors even if you&apos;re in dimmer settings, as per TECNO. This imaging setup, dubbed PolarAce, rocks Sony&apos;s CXD5622GG imaging chip to make all this happen. TECNO says you can even capture the breathtaking beauty of the auroras up north or the mesmerizing dusk scenes out in the desert.</p><p>On top of that, you&apos;ve got four 50MP lenses onboard, featuring a Sony IMX890 50MP OIS main camera. Additionally, there&apos;s a periscope-style telephoto lens thrown into the mix, giving you 3x optical zoom and 60x digital zoom. Plus, there&apos;s a macro lens in there too, promising to keep your subjects sharp even when you&apos;re just 2.5cm away.</p><p>Up front, the phone packs a punch with a 50MP selfie camera. It even tracks your eyes and focuses in a blink, so you&apos;ll always look your best in photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PkyKx4ZnE2KERdcZSYeN3Q" name="CAMON 30 Premier 5G-game.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PkyKx4ZnE2KERdcZSYeN3Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But a phone is more than just its camera, and the Camon 30 Premier seems to have all bases covered for reliable performance. It rocks a 6.77-inch 120Hz AMOLED display, powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate 5G chip, with a whopping 24GB of RAM (including 12GB of extended memory) and a generous 512GB of flash storage.</p><p>While it&apos;s not a flagship chipset, it promises to keep things running smooth, even when you&apos;re using tons of apps or games. Plus, it&apos;s got this 10-layer "gaming-grade" cooling system and a massive 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>The battery supports 70W charging, juicing the phone up from 0 to 50% in a mere 16 minutes. TECNO claims this battery can handle a whopping 1,600 charge cycles and will keep at least 80% of its health for a solid four years.</p><p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-30-series-launch">Camon 30 series that made its debut earlier this month</a>, the Premier model comes packed with AI-based tricks. One of these, called AI Erase, claims to zap away unwanted stuff from your photos. Also in the mix is a feature called Universal Tone, which supposedly uses AI to nail down accurate skin tones in your snaps, no matter your complexion.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G is hitting store shelves globally starting in May. Pricing will vary by region, and it&apos;s not yet confirmed if it will be available in the United States (past TECNO phones haven&apos;t been).</p>
