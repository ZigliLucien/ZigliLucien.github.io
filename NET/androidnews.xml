                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s a lot of choice if you&apos;re interested in buying a Xiaomi phone in mid-2024; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> continues to be my recommendation if you need a smallish phone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">14 Ultra</a> has one of the best overall camera packages you&apos;ll find today. Then there are the value flagship offerings — the 13T Pro in particular is a standout choice.</p><p>While most manufacturers moved away from the idea of a mid-cycle refresh, Xiaomi&apos;s T series devices are an integral part of its phone portfolio, and last year&apos;s 13T series picked up a huge upgrade: Leica integration. Xiaomi needed a way to differentiate the 13T series against the POCO F5 and F5 Pro, and adding a few Leica effects and filters goes a long way in achieving that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Me938xzHVTwNNvx4wxBfGf" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-3.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Me938xzHVTwNNvx4wxBfGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the 13T Pro when it launched, and I switched back to the device recently to see how it holds up against 2024 value flagships. I&apos;m still not a fan of the design; the large rectangular camera island at the back with curving sides just doesn&apos;t look cohesive, and it comes across as half-done. While the blue version of the phone has a faux leather back, the black model has a glass back with a glossy finish that&apos;s just mundane.</p><p>The plastic sides don&apos;t quite have the same feel as the likes of the Xiaomi 14, but they don&apos;t have a glossy coat either, and that at least makes using the device a little easier. That said, I like the way the back curves to meet the mid-frame; even though the front of the phone has a flat panel, the curves at the back make a noticeable difference in usability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5LgUajSateJYfsC3ktQ7Qh" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-9.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5LgUajSateJYfsC3ktQ7Qh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the 13T Pro comes into its own is the screen; the 6.67-inch AMOLED panel has excellent colors and contrast levels, and it gets incredibly bright in daily use. The Xiaomi 14 managed to get a smidgen brighter in auto mode while outdoors, but the 13T Pro has absolutely no issues in this area, and like most Xiaomi phones, the stereo sound coming out of this thing is highly detailed, and <em>loud</em>.</p><p>Interestingly, Xiaomi went with a 144Hz refresh for the 13T series, and while I didn&apos;t notice too much of a difference between 120Hz and 144Hz, the 13T Pro has a level of immediacy and fluidity that I didn&apos;t notice outside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. Of course, you&apos;ll need to go into the settings to manually toggle the 144Hz mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kgnM2WqRZXWn7ddY3caapi" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-12.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgnM2WqRZXWn7ddY3caapi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the Dimensity 9200+ continues to deliver outstanding performance. It delivers stable framerates in demanding games, and the best part is that there is no noticeable overheating. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> has better figures in synthetic testing, it tends to get hotter as well, so if you want a gaming-focused phone that manages thermals, this is still a great option.</p><p>Another upgrade is around ingress protection, with the 13T Pro getting IP68 dust and water resistance as standard. This brings it closer to the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and Xiaomi 14, and is a good move from Xiaomi, considering the 12T models only had IP54. On that note, the vibration motor is much better this time as well, and it has granular feedback.</p>

<p>Where the 13T Pro truly differentiates itself from its predecessors is the cameras; the phone has a 50MP Sony IMX707 main camera with OIS, a 50MP zoom lens with 2x optical zoom, and a 12MP wide-angle that&apos;s much better than previous years. The camera isn&apos;t as good as the Xiaomi 14, but it has much better versatility than previous years, and the Leica collaboration means you get more shooting modes and effects.</p><p>But what I liked better is the battery life. The 13T Pro is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones">best Xiaomi phones</a> in this regard, and the 5000mAh battery managed to last a day and a half with relative ease. There wasn&apos;t a single day where the battery went below 20% even with heavy use, and there just isn&apos;t any need to be anxious in this regard. On that note, the 120W charging tech ensures a full charge takes just 28 minutes, and that party trick doesn&apos;t get old.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z3c7sMvvWCeRebjvSXY4jh" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-10.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3c7sMvvWCeRebjvSXY4jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the software, the 13T Pro switched to HyperOS in February, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based interface isn&apos;t noticeably different to MIUI 14. What is noticeable is that the overall interface has better fluidity and optimization, and in that sense, it is distinctly better than MIUI 14. The software itself is identical to what you get on other Xiaomi phones, and if you&apos;ve used MIUI for a while, you&apos;ll be immediately familiar with what&apos;s on offer.</p><p>The 13T Pro will get four Android OS updates, but given Xiaomi&apos;s glacial pace in this area, it&apos;s likely you&apos;ll need to wait at least until Q1 2025 to pick up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. That said, the phone will be updated to Android 17 when that becomes available, so it should be good for long-term use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JSoKzRbViZMNifJQ7BsX4h" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-8.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JSoKzRbViZMNifJQ7BsX4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi sells the 12GB/512GB model of the 13T Pro in the U.K., and while it went on sale earlier in the year, it is back up to its £699 ($890) retail price. That&apos;s still £149 ($190) less than the Xiaomi 14, and you get a larger screen and a bigger battery. If you want to maximize value, the standard Xiaomi 13T retails for £549 ($699), and while you don&apos;t get as much storage (it&apos;s sold in an 8GB/256GB configuration), it has the same set of cameras, same AMOLED panel, and same battery.</p><p>The only difference is that the 13T takes an additional 15 minutes to charge the 5000mAh battery as it has 67W charging tech. Honestly, you don&apos;t notice the difference in daily use, and for my money, I&apos;d get the Xiaomi 13T — it is the best value in Xiaomi&apos;s portfolio.</p>

<p>Considering where the 13T series is in its product cycle, Xiaomi is bound to start heavily discounting the devices as it starts to shift attention to the upcoming 14T models. I also like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> quite a bit, and while it has better cameras, they&apos;re not quite in the same league as the 13T series, so if that&apos;s a priority, you should pick up the 13T or 13T Pro.</p>

<p>Jabra announced this morning (June 11) new versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">Elite 8 Active</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">Elite 10</a>, featuring what it claims to be the world’s first LE Audio smart case. </p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 and Elite 10 Gen 2 each offer unique features. The Elite 10 is perfect for daily use, while the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 is built tough for your workouts. However, the real game-changer is the smart case, which enables wireless streaming from any device with a USB-C or 3.5mm port. With dual USB-C and 3.5mm compatibility, it provides universal streaming and connectivity.</p>

<p>A built-in chip in the case makes connecting and streaming audio from various devices a breeze. It also offers lower latency than standard Bluetooth, ensuring better audio and video sync and Hi-Fi sound quality. Plus, the 2-in-1 cable turns the charging case into a versatile adapter for spatial sound streaming directly to the earbuds.</p><p>The new models feature improved Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) that blocks up to twice as much noise as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">previous versions</a>, especially in the mid- and low-frequency ranges. They also have six-microphone call technology and enhanced AI algorithms for clearer calls, prioritizing your voice over background noise.</p><p>Battery life is solid, too. The Elite 10 Gen 2 offers six hours of playback, extendable to 27 hours with the wireless charging case and ANC on. They’re IP57-rated for dust and water resistance.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp is testing a new feature that reminds users of their status' privacy settings before sharing. </li><li>Users can choose to share their status with either all contacts, specific groups or pre-set contacts, making it easier to share with specific audiences without needing to constantly adjust privacy settings.</li><li>The new update is only available to some Beta testers at the moment, via the Google Play app and will be rolling out to others in the coming days.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>According to a recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-12-27-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, WhatsApp is testing a new feature that will add another layer of privacy to your status updates. The publication states that the new WhatsApp beta Android<strong> 2.24.12.27 </strong>update discovered that WhatsApp is rolling out a status privacy confirmation feature. </p><p>This means that users can control who sees their individual status updates. Anytime a user uploads a WhatsApp status, a prompt appears right before they hit share, showing them their status&apos; privacy settings and asking them if they wish to change it. By showing the status privacy settings before sharing content, users can post their status updates to specific groups without adjusting their settings for each status individually.</p><p>Users can share a status update with <strong>All contacts </strong>or <strong>Specific contacts</strong> previously set up by the user. Right now, WhatsApp lets users control who gets to view Status updates through<strong> Settings > Privacy;</strong> users can also select who views their updates on the Status Editor page.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.29%;"><img id="AjhYCbtQBh9uAqyLhjZgcC" name="WhatsApp-status-update-beta.png" alt="Whatsapp status update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjhYCbtQBh9uAqyLhjZgcC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1732" height="819" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this new update, WhatsApp aims to remind users to whom this status update is visible and adjust their privacy settings, ensuring that their content reaches only the "intended" contacts. </p><p>While we aren&apos;t sure when this update will roll out to users, WABetaInfo says that the status privacy confirmation feature is currently available to some beta testers who install the latest updates of WhatsApp beta for Android from the Google Play Store. It will roll out to more people in the "coming days."</p><p>Meanwhile, the messaging app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-status-updates-tray">recently announced</a> that it will allow longer status updates and voice notes. This allows users to upload WhatsApp status videos for up to one minute. These changes allow users to share longer moments and stories with their friends and family. </p><p>Additionally, WhatsApp is said to be improving the overall status experience by lining up the most relevant updates at the beginning of the list. This means updates from people you frequently talk to or contacts pinned in the Chats tab will be the first to pop on the horizontal list (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-beta-android-status-privacy-pop-up/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Android Central has contacted WhatsApp about this, but it did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

Surprisingly, it was actually shorter than last year&apos;s Keynote by about 20 minutes and was six minutes shorter than Google I/O 2024. With Apple starting to make the developer betas available, we wanted to have some fun and take a look at everything iOS 18 stole from Android.</p><p>This number has been steadily rising in recent years, but at first glance, iOS 18 takes the cake. There are a staggering number of things that Apple claims are "revolutionary," completely ignoring the world that uses Android.</p>
<h2 id="home-screen-and-lock-screen-2">Home Screen and Lock Screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a8usycLRxsvGBXKnoREMJ6" name="ios-18-home-screen-themes-layouts.jpg" alt="Home Screen themes and layouts on iPhone with iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a8usycLRxsvGBXKnoREMJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s only fitting to kick off this list by talking about the "new" customization options. For the first time ever, iPhone and iPad owners will be able to put their app icons and widgets <em>wherever they desire</em>. Until now, installed apps would fill the grid, only letting you change the order they were in, remove them, put them in folders, or push them around with widgets.</p><p>I can&apos;t help but laugh at this point, simply because this has been possible on Android since the beginning. Not to mention the various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-launchers">third-party app launchers</a> that give you all of the tools you would need to create a truly custom interface.</p><p>Speaking of personalization, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> has come to iOS. Of course, it&apos;s not the same implementation that Google uses, but it&apos;s basically the same, as iOS 18 makes it so you can change the color of your app icons. While we still hope to see the ability to use app icon packs, it&apos;s at least a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="control-center-2">Control Center</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Frhfiup2YEFdRXhShHgg5" name="ios-18-control-center.jpg" alt="Control Center redesign on iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Frhfiup2YEFdRXhShHgg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, Apple left Control Center unchanged for the last few releases. iOS 18 changes that, as there are now multiple panels for you to swipe through in order to access different quick toggles and settings. You can even customize the Control Center using a new Controls Gallery, adding various toggles from Apple or third-party developers.</p><p>In addition to the "main" Control Center panel, iOS 18 also adds panels for smart home controls, media playback, connectivity, and more. iPhone owners will also be able to resize different widgets here, something that actually would be nice to have on Android.</p>
<h2 id="on-device-ai-2">On-device AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck" name="apple-intelligence-ios-18.png" alt="Apple Intelligence examples on iPhone running iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There was a big reason why Apple did its own speed run through the various product categories, and of course, AI is to blame. The second half of the WWDC &apos;24 Keynote presentation was dedicated to "Apple Intelligence." Apple attempted to explain how Siri is basically being infused with Large Language Models and AI while showcasing different ways we should expect it to work.</p><p>Apple also shared that much of how Siri can interact with your phone and apps is handled by an on-device AI model. For times when you&apos;re trying to do something that your phone can&apos;t handle, it leans on "Private Cloud Compute" servers. And if you ask Siri a question that it can&apos;t answer, OpenAI and ChatGPT will swoop in to save the day.</p><p>Needless to say, Google got there before Apple with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> model, which is found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>. It, too, relies on servers when the model can&apos;t do what you&apos;re asking. But it will be interesting to pit Gemini against Siri to see which comes out on top.</p>
<h2 id="photos-2">Photos</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CyPwkh7hpVusKCLiTsh9M5" name="ios-18-photos-redesign.jpg" alt="Apple Photos redesign on iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CyPwkh7hpVusKCLiTsh9M5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although I use the Photos app on my own iPhone, the majority of my photo library management still goes through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>. It&apos;s pretty apparent that this is also the case for Apple employees, as there are quite a few familiar features making their way to iOS 18.</p><p>Collections are pretty self-explanatory and are coming to the native Photos app on iOS 18. A new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-collections-tab-highlights-automated-suggestions-new-design">Collections tab</a> has already been slowly rolling out on Android phones as Google continues testing the feature, although it appears to be a slightly reworked version of the current Library tab with a bit more emphasis on auto-generated albums like People & Pets. Memories are another type of collection, but they are getting juiced up with AI on Apple&apos;s Photos app, allowing you to enter a prompt, and your device will create a collage or movie.</p><p>Arguably, the biggest addition to Photos on iOS 18 will be the ability to remove unwanted objects from the background. It&apos;s just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> for the iPhone, but without the need for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> or the Google Photos app to achieve it.</p>
<h2 id="mail-and-messaging-2">Mail and Messaging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EZNgCCr7AGvNM575ZJiit5" name="ios-18-mail-changes.jpg" alt="Categories in Mail app on iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZNgCCr7AGvNM575ZJiit5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting the boring stuff out of the way first, Apple didn&apos;t pay too much attention to its built-in Mail app. However, it is gaining "on-device categorization," meaning that there will be categories based on the types of emails that are residing within your inbox. These are essentially the same as what Inbox by Gmail introduced all the way back in 2015.</p><p>Speaking of Inbox by Gmail, the Messages app is getting another feature that Android&apos;s various SMS/MMS apps have had: the ability to schedule a message. There&apos;s really not much else to explain here other than that you can pick the date and time, type out the message, and schedule it. Groundbreaking.</p><p>The topic that everyone seemed to be talking about leading up to the WWDC &apos;24 Keynote was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>. All of that hype accounted for a split-second mention as RCS will arrive on the iPhone with iOS 18. And yes, the "blue bubble" war will rage on, as non-iPhone users still show up with a green bubble.</p>

<p>In a feature that literally nobody asked for, Apple is trying to "flex its muscles" with its AI-powered "Genmoji." Using the on-device LLM, write a prompt explaining what you want the emoji to look like, wait for it to be generated, and pick from the provided options. While it&apos;s not <em>exactly</em> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gboard-emoji-mashups-and-how-create-your-own">Google&apos;s Emoji Kitchen</a>, the premise of Genmoji is definitely the same.</p>

<p>Both Android and iOS have offered ways to natively store your passwords, but weren&apos;t available as true competitors to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">best password managers</a>. Google began changing that in 2022 with the ability to add a shortcut to your home screen.</p><p>iOS 18 is doing something similar, as there&apos;s finally a dedicated Passwords app across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even Windows.

This aims to help improve the gaming experience by reducing the amount of potential interference caused by apps in the background.</p><p>After making its debut with macOS Sonoma in 2023, Game Mode is coming to the iPhone and iPad. It hopes to ensure the smoothest gaming experience possible, without needing to worry about a different app hogging up all of the resources. Additionally, Apple claims Game Mode "dramatically reduces audio latency with AirPods, and makes wireless game controllers incredibly responsive."</p>
<h2 id="quot-tap-to-cash-quot-2">"Tap to Cash"</h2>

<p>This one was pretty funny to me, as Apple is bringing "Tap to Cash" to the iPhone. What makes this funny is that you&apos;ll no longer be able to do this on your Android phone via GPay. The "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">GPay</a>" app has been deprecated in the U.S. in favor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> app, which does not offer peer-to-peer transactions.</p>

<p>I&apos;m sure there are things that I missed, but it appears as though iOS 18 is morphing into an Android skin. Even if you ignore everything in regard to Apple Intelligence, there are so many changes and additions coming that it&apos;s enough to make your head spin. Whether you love it, hate it, or don&apos;t care, there&apos;s little denying that iOS 18 should be a massive step in the right direction for iPhone owners.</p>

<ul><li>Google rolled out the highly-anticipated Find My Device network for the Android ecosystem in April 2024.</li><li>Now, the first wave of Find My Device-supported item trackers is starting to hit the hands of reviewers and buyers.</li><li>Early reports indicate Find My Device is less reliable than Apple's Find My network, and Google's extensive opt-out options may be the reason why. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> have plenty of advantages over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhones</a>, and there aren&apos;t a ton of iOS features that truly make Android users jealous. With that in mind, Apple&apos;s Find My network is certainly something that Android users were a bit envious of — and if they weren&apos;t, they should&apos;ve been. The network uses over a billion active devices and works with $29 item trackers (AirTags) to make finding your tech and other items painless. Apple goes as far as to say that your phone can&apos;t go a single city block without updating its location in Find My. </p><p>Google finally came up with a real answer to Apple&apos;s Find My network with Find My Device. It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">a crowdsourcing network for Android</a> that works similarly to Find My. In fact, Google makes the same claim that Find My Device includes over a billion active devices. The network just rolled out in April and became more widely available in May. Now, the first wave of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-announces-google-find-my-device-compatible-trackers">Find My Device-capable item trackers</a> is shipping. </p><p>But the experience of using Find My Device so far hasn&apos;t been the one Google billed. Some reviewers have already pointed out that Samsung phones might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/09/android-find-my-device-network-rollout-problems/" target="_blank">automatically hibernate the Find My Device app</a> , and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pebblebee-tag-android-review/" target="_blank">Find My Device won&apos;t find your items</a> in every case. There are a lot of reasons this may be the case, but I suspect it is because Google is making it too easy for users to opt out of participating in Find My Device at all. </p><p>It&apos;s rare that we would ever criticize a company for being <em>too</em> protective of user privacy, but that may be the case here. Google&apos;s choice of language and default setting options make it seem like using Find My Device to the full extent could compromise your safety. Reality is much simpler: you help me find my lost items, and I&apos;ll help you find yours. Crowdsourcing only works if people buy-in, and so far, it doesn&apos;t seem like people are buying into Find My Device. </p>
<h2 id="why-the-find-my-device-network-isn-apos-t-working-as-well-as-find-my-2">Why the Find My Device network isn&apos;t working as well as Find My</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ahfn5hKtPxgHXMwPvAB6mR" name="find-device-3.jpg" alt="Find My Device list of devices against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ahfn5hKtPxgHXMwPvAB6mR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some availability issues with the Find My Device network, and they may play a role in the network not being as robust as Google originally claimed. Despite the Find My Device network <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">rolling out widely last month</a>, it&apos;s still not showing up for everyone. This could be a small part of why Find My Device has come with mixed results in the early going, but there are bigger factors as to why this is the case. </p><p>According to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14796936?sjid=4241641955613578632-NC" target="_blank">official support page</a>, there are four options for your participation in the Find My Device network, including opting out of it altogether. Before we even break down each one, that&apos;s probably too many choices. When faced with more than a couple of settings toggles, casual users are likely to just switch a feature off instead of sifting through the complicated explanations for each one. </p><p>The other problem is that the default Find My Device setting is <strong>With network in high-traffic areas only</strong>. So, most Find My Device users are only participating in the network in places like airports or busy city streets. In other words, the majority of Android users aren&apos;t contributing to Find My Device in many places.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t8sWjiJCHqgnHTnPQahecR" name="find-device-2.jpg" alt="Find My Device home page log in to Google account against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t8sWjiJCHqgnHTnPQahecR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The setting that will really help the crowdsourcing effort is <strong>With network in all areas</strong>. There are also <strong>Without Network </strong>and <strong>Off </strong>options. However, all the settings I&apos;ve listed are found under the <strong>Find your offline devices</strong> page, and are not covered by the <strong>Use Find My Device</strong> toggle. That&apos;s because you can still use Find My Device to locate and erase your devices without contributing to the crowdsourced network in some cases. This feels like a big miss because users aren&apos;t incentivized to go all-in on Find My Device. </p><p>If there were a real privacy concern associated with Find My Device, I would be all for the expansive customization options, including opt-in and opt-out features. But there isn&apos;t one, as Google explains: "Device locations are encrypted and private from Google. Only you and those you share your devices within Find My Device will be able to see their locations."</p><p>The bigger concern with personal item tracking is people using trackers to stalk or harm people, which Google&apos;s Find My Device crowdsourcing settings don&apos;t cover. There is a separate suite of unwanted tracker detection features offered by Apple and Google to try and quell those concerns. Instead, the Find My Device privacy settings are intended to avoid the unlikely (and nearly impossible) event that your phone contributing to the network compromises your location. </p><p>This doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense because there is no way for a user to know which Android device contributed to the crowdsourcing effort that provided them with the location of their own device. Even in low-density areas, who knows which person, house, or car updated a device&apos;s location in Find My Device. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mBb8XvZiyUs3oTuUncprYS" name="find-device-8.jpg" alt="Find My Device device remote options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mBb8XvZiyUs3oTuUncprYS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This hasn&apos;t been an issue with Apple&apos;s Find My device network, and that&apos;s because Apple didn&apos;t overcomplicate things. If you turn on Find My, you get access to all the remote access and finding features, and contribute to the crowdsource network in exchange. If you turn it off, your devices won&apos;t contribute to Find My, and you&apos;ll lose the benefits of Find My as a result. It&apos;s simple.</p><p>I fear that in trying to appear privacy-conscious, Google is limiting the effectiveness of the Find My Device network. The overcomplicated settings page may make it seem like there&apos;s a reason to be wary of contributing. Plus, the default setting will only make the network useful in high-density areas. There are a lot of people that live in or near U.S. cities, but there are also many who don&apos;t.  </p><p>Sometimes too much choice is a bad thing, and that could be the case with Find My Device. It should be simple. Contribute to the Find My Device network and get the benefits, or opt out and don&apos;t. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung might bring its first Fan Edition smartwatch before the Galaxy Watch 7 series.</li><li>The smartwatch will get a launch date sooner than June 24 ahead of the Unpacked event.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch FE was also spotted in an Amazon listing, which confirms the earlier leaked specs and pricing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Galaxy Watch FE is turning out to be another interesting product in the Samsung products portfolio, which has been in the news lately. While it has been rumored to launch alongside the upcoming Galaxy foldables, new info suggests that the release might be sooner.</p><p>According to reliable tipster Arsène Lupin on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-fe-release-date-price-leaks/">SamMobile</a>), the Galaxy Watch FE is heading for a June 24 launch right before the anticipated<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor"> July Unpacked event</a> where we will be witnessing the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Z Flip 6, next to the Galaxy Watch 7 series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Watch FE will release June 24th<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1799064847210119471">June 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, another Amazon Italy listing spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-pricing-leaked-via-amazon/">YTECHB</a> has revealed the smartwatch’s pricing, which is set at €199 (~$215).  The pricing affirms that it falls under the cheaper smartwatch segment or an entry-level Galaxy Watch, as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> will likely be priced at $299, considering the predecessor Galaxy Watch 6’s launch last year.</p><p>Interestingly, in the U.S., the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is available at $239 on Samsung&apos;s website, and the upcoming Watch FE is likely to be priced at around $200. It will be interesting to see what customers might lean into, considering that Watch 6 will have more features than the upcoming Fan Edition since it will be a toned version of the former.</p>

<p>Donna asks:</p><p><em><strong>I asked about buying a charger for my Galaxy phone that could charge it faster and some people were saying that fast charging was bad for the phone battery. If it is then why do companies use it?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you.</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Donna! That&apos;s a really good question because it says a lot about our "disposable" tech life. Because I like to front-load the answer so we can talk more about it, I&apos;ll say it like this:</p><p>Yes, any type of fast charging will diminish the lifespan of your phone&apos;s battery. But we shouldn&apos;t worry about it. The benefits will outweigh any issues for almost everyone. Here&apos;s why.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="wZBxNnvfBAAfW4HpCZi4JG" name="motorola-edge-battery-life.jpeg" alt="Motorola Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZBxNnvfBAAfW4HpCZi4JG.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We need to start by talking about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery&apos;s lifespan</a>. I don&apos;t mean how long it lasts before you need to charge your phone again, but how long it will live before it gets so bad you need to replace it or buy a new phone.</p><p>Your phone&apos;s battery life is measured in what manufacturers call charge cycles. You&apos;ve used a charge cycle if you charge your battery from 0% to 100%, and most phone battery life is between 400 and 500 cycles.</p><p>Note that your phone battery won&apos;t really charge to 100% and will only hit 0% if you leave it off for a long time. There isn&apos;t enough measurable difference to matter, though, so relying on the numbers you see on your phone is good enough.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you charge your phone well before it reaches a low enough charge so it turns off. Sometimes, we can&apos;t wait to charge it to full and stop charging before it reaches 100%. This still counts against the rated lifespan, and if you could do all the math to turn several partial charges into a full cycle, you&apos;ll see issues when you hit about 500 of them.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean your battery stops working once you&apos;ve hit the magic number. It means your battery won&apos;t be able to charge as much and will discharge faster. You can imagine that charge cycle 501 is like charging your battery to 95%, but it reads 100%. Also note that these numbers are estimated, and your battery may be affected a little sooner or might be good a little longer. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wMgPZw9mQWDKayRkqPXzsi" name="samsung-45w-fast-charger_0.jpg" alt="Samsung 45w Fast Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMgPZw9mQWDKayRkqPXzsi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Eventually, your battery capacity will be affected enough to notice. You will have to charge more often, and the situation will get worse and worse. You will either need to have the battery replaced or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">buy a new phone</a> to get things back to how they were.</p><p>Batteries, even rechargeable lithium batteries like the ones used in phones, are disposable. When mobile phones first showed up, they all had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-removable-battery">removable batteries</a> you could change yourself, but now almost every phone has a sealed battery that requires you to take things apart to change them. Phone batteries have come a long way, too, and most people will end up getting a new phone before they need to replace the battery.</p>
<p>Heat will affect the number of charge cycles a battery lasts. Heat is a by-product of charging a battery, and the hotter it gets and how often it gets hot, the shorter its lifespan will be. This is where fast charging will affect things.</p><p>Fast charging moves enough energy that it <em>does</em> create more heat than using a slower method of charging a battery. However, safeguards are in place to minimize the effect it will have.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3561px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mPf8nsFYxrX95AGb75dCFF" name="RedMagic-DAO-150W-GaN-Charger-7.jpg" alt="RedMagic DAO 150W GaN Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPf8nsFYxrX95AGb75dCFF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3561" height="2003" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you fast charge a phone, it doesn&apos;t run full blast all the time. Circuits inside the phone and the charger communicate so that charging speed is ramped up until a certain point is reached, then everything slows down to keep the heat from getting out of hand. If the phone battery gets too hot at any time, the charging speed also slows. </p><p>These safeguards mean that fast charging will have a minimal effect on your battery&apos;s actual lifespan but will still work to get your phone from a low-battery state to one where there is enough charge to use it.</p>
<p>While fast charging does technically lower the life of your battery, it isn&apos;t going to have a practical effect. As long as you use an approved charger and cable and don&apos;t do something silly like put your phone under a blanket, it will be fine.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s U.S.-based Galaxy S24 series devices have been spotted picking up the latest June security patch.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-june-2024-update-available-for-download/">SamMobile</a>, users in the U.S. under the Verizon Wireless cellular network have started receiving the June patch. Users should begin downloading and installing version <strong>S928USQS2AXE4</strong> as the week continues. Verizon&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-update/">changelog</a> didn&apos;t detail much excitement with the June patch aside from your typical "security improvements."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Samsung</a>, its June patch contains 37 "High" priority fixes. One fix involves Samsung Dialer, which rectifies an issue that could&apos;ve allowed an attacker to place a phone call without "proper permission." Other fixes involve stopping attackers from accessing a Galaxy device&apos;s memory.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-06-01">Google detailed</a> its part in the June security update, offering insight into 12 Framework fixes and seven System fixes.</p><p>The publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s23-plus-ultra-june-2024-security-update-usa/">also spotted</a> the Galaxy S23 series picking up the June security patch marked as version <strong>S91xUSQS3CXE3</strong>. The update is rolling out for the S23, S23 Plus, and the S23 Plus in the U.S. on T-Mobile and US Cellular.</p><p>While carrier-locked Galaxy S24s and S23s are the first to receive the patch, other networks and unlocked devices are likely to follow. The update was spotted early today (June 10), so users should exercise patience as it makes its rounds throughout the week.</p>

<p>We&apos;re still waiting (not so) patiently for the next Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s camera update, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/next-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-upgrade-might-be-on-hold-for-a-bit">has been delayed</a> since April. The patch will likely solve several glitches and problems users have faced with the S24 Ultra&apos;s cameras. Users have continued to report problems with the device&apos;s HDR and telephoto camera&apos;s performance.</p><p>It seems folks will have to wait until June or July for those fixes.</p><p>In other news, the Galaxy S24 series&apos; Instant Slow-mo feature, powered by Galaxy AI, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24s-slow-mo-hdr-boost-confirmed">recently confirmed</a> to pick up some improvements. Slated for One UI 6.1.1, the quirky feature is said to receive support for HDR 10 Plus, which would let users utilize its slow-motion effects in the higher-quality video setting.</p><p>Moreover, the option to quickly share those slowed-down recordings will become easier through the pop-up menu.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm quietly lists Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 on its website without any fuss.</li><li>The positioning of the new SoC appears interesting as it sits between the older Snapdragon 695 and the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1.</li><li>The chipset will likely power the mid-range and budget Android phones this year, as there are two models: one with 5G and the other without 5G.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm launched a new chipset silently, and it showed up on its website over the weekend. The mid-range chipset dubbed Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 has been interestingly launched in two versions: a 5G model and a 4G one.</p><p>The name game with Qualcomm chips has always been confusing, particularly with the non-premium tier models, and so is their positioning. For instance, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-6-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-6s-gen-3-mobile-platform#Overview">Snapdragon 6s Gen 3</a>, which sounds like an upgraded model over the previous Snapdragon 6 Gen 1, is not, in fact, a downgrade (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-6s-gen-3-3449654/">Android Authority</a>).</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> launched in 2022 bore SM650 model number equipped four Cortex A78 cores with clock speeds up to 2.2GHz and four Cortex A55 cores with 1.8GHz clock speeds, aided by Adreno 710 GPU. The latest Snapdragon 6s Gen 3, on the other hand, with SM6375-AC (5G) and SM6370 (4G), equips two Cortex A78 cores with 2.3GHz and six Cortex A55 with 2.0GHz clock speeds, accompanied by Adreno 619 GPU. </p><p>On paper, it looks relatively identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-launches-mid-range-snapdragon-5g-chips">Snapdragon 695</a> from 2021, which came with the SM6375 model and offered similar clock speeds and the same GPU. Interestingly, it was rebranded as a Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 in 2022. While the confusion persists, it is still a new chipset that will likely power the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">mid-range phones</a> this year.</p>
<p>Another notable thing about the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is the inclusion of the Snapdragon X51 5G modem. While both the SM6375-AC (5G) and SM6370 (4G) versions of the SoC incorporate the same 5G modem, it is unclear why Qualcomm chose to bring the 4G version of the chipset by locking the 5G modem. Perhaps the only possible reason appears to be to get the new octa-core CPU tailored for more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a>.</p><p>Android Authority goes on to say that the OEM manufacturers might use the slightly modified Snapdragon 695 with the new Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 label as part of a marketing effort to sell phones that suggest the SoC is entirely new, even though it is a rehashed one.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> is a great phone for the price, and with $50 off, it's looking even more appealing. It comes with a bright, good-looking 6.78-inch AMOLED screen, with a 120Hz refresh rate. It also charges super quickly in about 35 minutes, and the battery will reliably get you about a day and a half per charge.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 12R also features decent cameras, though some of the auxiliary lenses are slightly lacking.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;re looking for a phone with a particularly good-looking AMOLED display; you want a phone with excellent battery life and fast charging speeds; resistance to dust and water is a selling point for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather go with the OnePlus 12 for more software updates; you want a phone with wireless charging; you&apos;re looking for a phone that will let you run games at higher than 60fps.</p><p>The classic "flagship killer", the OnePlus 12R is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> out there, while still offering great hardware and specs. Between the 6.78-inch AMOLED display, the overall premium-feeling design, and its smooth performance, this phone is pretty impressive at this price point, and that&apos;s just the tip of the iceberg. It also comes with IP65 dust and water resistance, and between 128GB and 256GB of storage. Battery life can consistently reach about a day and a half per charge, and it charges up in just a bit over 30 minutes.</p><p>Don&apos;t expect as many software updates as the OnePlus 12, with the 12R only offering three years of Android OS updates and four years of security updates. While some of the auxiliary cameras aren&apos;t the best, you&apos;ll still get pretty good photo and video quality with the normal lenses under most circumstances.</p><p>All in all, this phone dropping to its lowest price ever is a good deal, and it&apos;s not likely to last long.</p>
