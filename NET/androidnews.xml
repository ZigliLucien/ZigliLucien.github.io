While these aren&apos;t the Gen 2 Elite 10s, these are still great earbuds for any casual user, with features such as adaptive ANC, spatial audio, simple buttons, and more.</p>

<p>We like the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">Jabra Elite 10</a> earbuds for multiple reasons, and while the Gen 2 version of the wireless buds is our favorite out there, they build on a lot of the best things about the first-gen version. At 30% off, it's hard to deny their value, offering a great mid-level earbud set for under $200.</p>
<p>The Elite 10s offer convenient features like ANC, EQ, head tracking and spatial audio, plus the inclusion of physical buttons, which many like.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB91JNZT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1ff1cc41-e420-468e-a64f-0de4303df4d7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$" data-dimension48="$">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for affordable earbuds that still offer high-quality audio.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need something with especially long battery life; you need access to hi-res audio other than AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs.</p><p>The Gen 2 version of these earbuds are our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds#section-best-overall">best wireless earbuds</a>, and these are also pretty solid. They come with IP57 water and dust resistance, multi-device Bluetooth connections, and a range of features from ANC and EQ to head tracking for spatial audio and more.</p><p>Admittedly, battery life isn&apos;t always particularly strong on the Elite 10 earbuds, especially if you keep features like ANC and head tracking for spatial audio on. However, you can easily turn these off to help boost battery life, and Jabra says you can get up to 36 hours of use without them and with the charging case.</p>

<p>I didn&apos;t buy much this Prime Day as some of the things I was looking at weren&apos;t on sale. However, we did need a new air fryer, our old one is a bit janky. We opted for this Cosori in white and I&apos;m pretty excited about getting it. Getting an air fryer is actually incredibly great for your kitchen and you can make a lot of great meals. I think it looks especially clean and classy, too.</p><p><strong>* COSORI Pro Gen 2 Air Fryer</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Performance-Functions-Dishwasher-Safe-Detachable/dp/B0BD4BYR11?th=1"><del>$119</del> <strong>$99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The other thing I got wasn&apos;t on sale, unfortunately. I have been wanting one of these SpinWave mops because I&apos;ve heard some really good things. I&apos;ve also heard the cordless version isn&apos;t very good when it comes to battery life so I opted for the corded version even though it&apos;s not on sale. Since Bissell sends a portion of every sale to its pet foundation it&apos;s OK. I&apos;ll support any company that loves dogs as much as I do!</p><p><strong>* Bissell SpinWave PET Hard Floor Spin Mop: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-SpinWave-Hard-Floor-20399/dp/B08HZFVNS7?th=1"><strong>$108 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>I purchased this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3RFXRL/">Audio-Technica Bluetooth Turntable</a> as sort of an impulse buy. Ever since my friend got a turntable a year ago, I&apos;ve been wanting one myself, mostly for the nostalgia of it all. This looked like the best option as it supports Bluetooth 5, Qualcomm AptX, and Hi-Fi audio, meaning I finally have a reason to dust off my Marshall speaker. I don&apos;t own any vinyl records right now, but many of my favorite artists have released their albums on vinyl, and I plan to start a collection.</p><p><strong>* Audio-Technica Fully Automatic Stereo Turntable:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3RFXRL/"><del>$219</del> <strong>$149 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

I’ve had my eye on these smart TVs for a while but wasn’t sure if they were too gimmicky or not. The idea is simple: you take a Samsung smart TV and give it an anti-glare display with a matte finish alongside a super-lightweight construction that sits flat against the wall. Once it’s installed, The Frame TV is supposed to look indistinguishable from a framed painting (when you use Art Mode, of course). I love the idea of not having an ugly TV hanging in my bedroom, and since Amazon is dropping 15% off the 43-inch model, it seemed worth a shot!</p><p><strong>* Samsung 43-Inch The Frame Series Smart TV:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV9HY4J9?th=1"><del>$997</del> <strong>$847 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

Running Android 14 (with Motorola's Hello UI overlay) out of the box, the smartphone sports a dual-lens primary camera setup. Other notable additions include an IP68 rating, and stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JB6HP5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5cde2f29-7297-496b-af94-9c43ea8acfa4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you want a stylish Android phone with a great in-hand feel, an eye-friendly display, and super-fast charging capabilities.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> you want powerful performance, amazing cameras, and long software support. </p><p>Over the last few years, Motorola has gained quite a reputation for delivering mobile devices that punch way above their weight. Among them is the Motorola Edge 2024; it ticks a lot of boxes, even if it&apos;s not one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones" target="_blank">best Motorola phones</a> available out there.</p><p>Having a 6.6-inch curved pOLED display with a fast 144Hz refresh rate, the Motorola Edge 2024 makes on-screen interactions a delight. Then there&apos;s the gorgeous vegan leather back panel that not only helps with the looks but improves the in-hand feel as well. Under the hood, the Edge 2024 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 SoC and 8GB of RAM. Although Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich found the device&apos;s performance to be a bit disappointing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, everyday use tasks (e.g., media consumption, web browsing) shouldn&apos;t be too much of an issue. You also get a dual-lens rear camera system that&apos;s good enough for occasional use, as long as keep your expectations in check.</p><p>In terms of software, you get Android 14 out of the box, spruced up with Motorola&apos;s &apos;Hello UI&apos; overlay and a variety of extras. One such feature is called &apos;Motorola Smart Connect&apos; and allows for a fuss-free multi-device user experience. It generally works quite well, although the phone will only receive up to two years of software updates. Connectivity and I/O options include everything you&apos;d expect, and even some handy extras like NFC and USB Type-C 3.1 with DisplayPort output. Rounding off the spec sheet is a 5,000mAh battery with support for 68W wired and 15W wireless charging.</p><p>Of course, Motorola Edge 2024 isn&apos;t without its flaws. The overall performance isn&apos;t exactly the best, and the camera quality is also fairly average. However, considering the discounted price, these things shouldn&apos;t be dealbreakers for most people.</p>

<ul><li>Google Chat users will be able to share a short three-minute video message on the platform.</li><li>They can also send these to 1:1 Direct Messages (DMs), group DMs, and spaces.</li><li>The aim of the new video message is to save time, convey more information, and add tone to deliver the message.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The search giant has announced that Google Chat is gaining new ways for users on the messaging platform to interact with people more effectively through video messages.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/send-video-messages-in-google-chat.html">Workspace blog post</a> early this week, the company announced support for video messages in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-chat">Google Chat</a>, which will help users "save time, convey more information, add tone or emphasis" in various scenarios. This new rollout is believed to be helpful in multiple scenarios, one of which, according to the search giant, is "Team members sending a video with outstanding updates in lieu of attending a live meeting."</p>
<p>The new capability allows users to share a three-minute video message, which appears neither too long nor too short and should probably fit just right to convey a message within the Chat. </p><p>Sending the new video message also looks simple: Users can select the record button in the Chat compose box, and before sending the recording message, users can either preview it or re-record it.</p><p>These video messages can be sent in 1:1 Direct Messages (DMs), group DMs, and spaces. They can also interact with quotes, reactions, and replies in thread format. These are further stored in the "Media section of the Shared tab," notes the blog post.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:954px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.89%;"><img id="yAxkXyEFTL9s38tqGnwZF4" name="Google-Chat-Video-message.gif" alt="Google Chat video message feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yAxkXyEFTL9s38tqGnwZF4.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="954" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google says the new form of messaging can be sent through the web and received on all other platforms. However, ChromeOS, Linux, and Firefox aren&apos;t supported just yet. Besides, users can still not record and send video messages through mobile. </p><p>Regardless, the support is expected to take place very soon, and Google is also planning to add "transcription services" for these video messages to "further enhance the experience."</p><p>As for the rollout has already begun for Rapid Release domains, and Scheduled Release domains are expected to get it starting October 25. The availability of the features on Google Workspace is limited to the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Business</strong> Starter, Standard, Plus </li><li><strong>Enterprise</strong> Standard, Plus </li><li><strong>Essentials</strong> Starter, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Essentials Plus </li><li><strong>Nonprofits</strong> </li><li><strong>Frontline</strong> Starter, Standard</li></ul>
<p>The latest video messages feature to Chat is an extension of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-mobile-rollout">voice messages</a> feature, which was added back in March this year. It is interesting to see Google Chat competing with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">rival messaging apps</a> like WhatsApp, which also added a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-gets-short-form-video-sharing-feature">video messages feature</a> not very long ago.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You find yourself on the go a lot and hate the way your neck feels after looking down at your laptop, Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, or other portable device with a screen. These glasses plug into virtually any device with USB-C display out support and let you look where you want without craning your neck.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You don&apos;t use portable devices much or already have a pair of XR smart display glasses. These also aren&apos;t an alternative to a VR headset like a Meta Quest.</p>
<p>I primarily use Viture XR glasses when working away from my desk or on work trips. Since I travel up to half a dozen times per year for this job, I regularly find myself working from an airplane, an airport, or an uncomfortable hotel room with terrible seating ergonomics. Having the display on my face makes a <em>huge</em> difference for comfort in these situations!</p><p>Viture Pro XR glasses are seriously incredible for work as they not only feature a brighter screen with better clarity than previous generations but also get rid of the fuzzy edges prominent on other smart display glasses. That makes text actually readable — especially in the corners and along the edges of the screen — so you can get more done without all the neck pain.</p><p>The fact that these come with a Viture X 8BitDo controller for free — one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">best mobile controllers</a> available — only further increases the value you&apos;re getting here. That makes it easy to game on the go with just your phone, glasses, and controller so you can have a truly minimalist setup even while lying in bed!</p>

<p>If $409 is too expensive, you might want to consider Viture One XR glasses, instead.

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You&apos;re a mobile gamer who can&apos;t stand the neck or arm pain that comes with looking down at your favorite system&apos;s screen for hours at a time. Viture One glasses put a virtual TV on your face so you can game even while lying down or in a cramped airplane seat.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You don&apos;t think you&apos;ll use the dock for gaming all that often. Better to save the money and just get the glasses by themselves. It still doubles as a 13,000mAh power bank to charge phones and other devices, though, so it&apos;s not a bad buy even if you don&apos;t game that much.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while Viture One glasses work with a Steam Deck without any additional hardware, you <strong>will need the dock</strong> to use Viture One glasses with a Nintendo Switch. That&apos;s because using the dock tricks the Switch into thinking it&apos;s been plugged into the dock that connects to your TV. Since Viture One glasses work like a TV on your face, that&apos;s exactly what you&apos;re doing!</p><p>The 13,000mAh battery inside the mobile dock will keep your Switch going for an extra 6 hours, while it&apos;ll give the Steam Deck an extra 3 hours of playtime. Viture also sells a handy clip that snaps onto the back of the Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch so you can clip everything together for ultimate portability.</p><p>As a bonus, the dock can be used to charge <em>any</em> USB device when you plug it into any of the three USB-C ports. Yes, that means you can even charge three devices at the same time, so it&apos;s a win-win-win.</p>

<ul><li>A new report details that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 have not received any new Play Systems updates since launch.</li><li>The devices launched with the April 2024 patch; however, the foldables have not received any new ones nor are any available for manual download.</li><li>Google Play System updates can bolster Play Protect and upgrade Android's security and privacy.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A curious discovery shows that Samsung&apos;s 2024 foldables are uncharacteristically stuck living in the past software-wise.</p><p>Samsung has seemingly forgotten the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Fold 6, and the monthly Google Play System updates. As highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-stuck-on-old-google-play-system-updates/">SamMobile</a>, the devices have not received an updated version of Google&apos;s Play System software since they were released. The foldable phones are seemingly stuck rocking the April 2024 version of Play Systems and this isn&apos;t a funny user error.</p><p>The publication notes that Samsung&apos;s monthly security updates and Google&apos;s Play Systems patches are not one. Users can attempt to manually update the software by heading into <strong>Settings > About phone > Software information > Google Play Systems update</strong>. However, there&apos;s nothing there. For unknown reasons, Samsung hasn&apos;t pushed the availability of such a patch to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a>.</p><p>The Play System updates ensure that the "core elements" of Android are running in ship shape. This also affects the performance of the Play Store.</p><p>Further digging shows that Samsung&apos;s 2024 foldables are the only devices left out of the loop. The company&apos;s past-gen devices and the Galaxy S24 <em>have </em>been consistently updated with the latest Play Systems software</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-foldables-play/?taid=67060de10200580001cb5eeb&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a> chimed in, theorizing that the AI capabilities and software may be the culprit. There&apos;s a chance that more "optimization" is required as Samsung polishes things alongside Galaxy AI. While probably, it&apos;s alarming that the company hasn&apos;t pushed anything, leaving its 2024 foldables with six-month-old software.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, Samsung left a few devices in a bygone software past late in 2023. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-phones-reportedly-stuck-with-older-google-play-system-update">reported last December</a> that the Galaxy S23 series, Fold 5, and the Galaxy A33 were all rocking a July 2023 version of Google Play Systems. Strangely, users attempting to update manually were being hit with a "your device is up to date" message when they weren&apos;t. Another instance saw an "updates are temporarily unavailable" message.</p><p>It was suggested that such issues would solve themselves automatically. We know Samsung has been toiling away at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">One UI 6.1.1</a> (before its rollout) <em>and </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-plans-one-ui-7-public-beta">One UI 7</a> (Android 15). So, things will likely be resolved for the Flip 6 and Fold 6 in due time — we just have to wait.</p><p>Google&apos;s Play Systems updates can bring important security and privacy fixes. In June, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-system-june-updates-detailed">the update that rolled out</a> improved such aspects of Android and included support for new "Digital Wallets & Payment" processes. The update lets users pair a USB-C cable with Wi-Fi for faster data transfers between devices, as well.</p><p>Play Protect played a role as Google upgraded its ability to better safeguard users against malicious application threats.</p>

And before you ask, Jabra intends to support its earbuds through the coming years, so you should have little to no reservations about picking these up, especially now that they&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5DP3PYH">down to their lowest price</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2</a> launched earlier this year for $229, so it&apos;s surprising that they&apos;re already on sale. With Prime Day shaving $50 off, you can snag these excellent earbuds for just $179, which is the lowest price we&apos;ve seen them thus far.</p>

<p>Jabra's latest and last fitness earbuds are among the best you can own, thanks to superb audio and a unique Bluetooth LE case. These earbuds are still only months old, but Prime Day is slashing more than 20% off, bringing these to their lowest price.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5DP3PYH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9f007e0a-63b5-411f-a7c2-abd0a5fcac0a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$229.99" data-dimension48="$229.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>If the Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 are anything like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">first-generation Elite 8 Active earbuds</a>, then these are definitely a must-buy. I love the first-gen earbuds, as they offer great sound quality, easy multi-point pairing, and long battery life, even with ANC on. However, the Gen 2 take things up a notch, adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE Audio</a> to the case itself. Why, you ask? Because that way, you can connect the case to an audio source that may not support Bluetooth and stream music to your earbuds.</p><p>If you travel a lot like I do, then this can be incredibly useful, as not every airplane supports Bluetooth connectivity, and I don&apos;t own any wired headphones (the ones they give out on planes are absolutely horrible). The earbuds are also great for working out, thanks to the IP68 and MIL-STD-810 ratings.</p><p>But you should act fast, as it&apos;s the final day of Prime Day and some color options are seemingly sold out and your options are dwindling.</p>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want earbuds with great audio quality and durability. Also if you find yourself on airplanes a lot and want to use your own earbuds to enjoy in-flight entertainment.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You are unsure about long-term support given Jabra&apos;s exit from the consumer audio space.</p>
<p>As impressive as these are, it&apos;s also worth noting that these aren&apos;t even Jabra&apos;s best earbuds! The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2</a> are almost perfect and feature the same impressive audio and connectivity as the 8 Gen 2.

Its note-taking tools were fairly basic at launch, but it&apos;s gotten some great updates since then to make it more useful for productivity.</p><p>Unfortunately, my fiancée spied me reading comfortably one too many times and asked to "borrow" my Kindle Scribe for a vacation. She fell in love with it...and kept it, leaving me reading my ebooks on my bright Mac screen. I thought about buying a second Scribe, but the $340 price tag scared me off. Now that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B"><strong>$254.99 (25% off) for Prime Day</strong></a>, it&apos;s my chance to spare my strained eyes.</p>

<p>This massive 10.2-inch, 300 ppi e-ink tablet is (was) my favorite way to read ebooks, and also doubled as a sketching and note-taking pad. You can import PDFs to annotate them or send work notes to your computer, or add sticky notes to ebooks. This is slightly higher than the lowest price we've seen ($239), but still an excellent deal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c19b79c8-19c4-4f5c-b1e5-d3f0cc49e6c9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Scribe: $339.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Scribe: $339.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>(I&apos;m obligated to report that my partner disagrees with the headline and says that I could have reclaimed my Kindle Scribe at any time. Uh-huh. Love you, sweetie.)</p><p>The Kindle Scribe isn&apos;t the most advanced or powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">e-ink tablet</a> out there. You should look at the Onyx Boox series if you want color e-ink or a full suite of Play Store apps, not just the Kindle store and basic notes. But these tablets are more expensive and a bit overcomplicated for anyone who just wants to read e-books on a large slab. </p>

<p>I also wish that you could take proper notes on the Kindle Scribe instead of having to put little sticky notes on the text. I get why: you can&apos;t resize the text without messing up the placement of notes, and there might be legal reasons against it. So you can only write directly on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=32897194011">specific ebooks</a> like Sudoku or crosswords. But I wish instead you could choose a specific text size and lock an ebook into a specific format, like a PDF, so students could take persistent notes for classes.</p><p>Still, my complaints about note-taking aside, I still want a Kindle Scribe more than I want a Kindle Paperwhite, even though it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-16-GB-adjustable/dp/B09TMN58KL"><strong>only $124.99 ($25 off) for Prime Day</strong></a>, simply because I care more about display space than portability. Glasses wearers or the elderly who struggle to read smaller text will appreciate the Scribe&apos;s size, trust me on that.</p>

This Prime Day deal is really hard to pass up as it slashes the price from the typical $149.99 to just $88! That's a massive 41% in savings.

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want lightweight headphones that are comfortable; you want good ANC performance on the cheap; you need stellar battery life.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you want something that feels premium; you need wear-detection sensors; you need something the folds to a smaller size.</p><p>I&apos;ve been personally using the Sony WH-CH720N for more than a year as my everyday work headphones, and I absolutely love them. I don&apos;t mind the slightly plasticky feel since they&apos;re only worn indoors, and the lightweight construction with long battery life are perfect for my needs. ANC performance is good too, but obviously not as good as Sony&apos;s more premium WH-1000 series. Audio quality is quite solid with good bass, detailed mids, and clear highs without being too shrill. The physical buttons are also large and easy to identify just by touch, once you learn the lay of the land.</p><p>The Sony WH-CH720N have always been excellent value for money headphones, and its even better if you can grab this Prime Day deal. This is the lowest price we&apos;ve seen for these headphones on Amazon (or anywhere for that matter), so make sure you grab it before it&apos;s all gone.</p>
