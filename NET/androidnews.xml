The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> looks nearly identical to the other phones in the S24 family, with a flat design and triple camera system. The phone features a 6.7-inch display, which means it sits between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Since it&apos;s a Fan Edition phone, the specs aren&apos;t as strong as its siblings. As such, the phone is powered by an Exynos 2400e, which is a low-power version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> powering certain versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. There&apos;s also 8GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, and access to features from Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and more.</p><p>On the back is a 50MP primary sensor with a 12MP ultrawide and 8MP 3x telephoto. Keeping the phone on is a 4700mAh battery with 25W wired charging. The phone is available in Blue, Graphite, Gray, Mint, and Yellow for $649 in the United States.</p>

<p>In addition to the Galaxy S24 FE, Samsung also launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a>, consisting of the Galaxy S10 Plus and S10 Ultra. The former features a 12.4-inch display, while the latter has a 14.6-inch panel. Samsung switched things up this year, and instead of using a Snapdragon chip, both tablets are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>. Additionally, both models also support 5G connectivity, making them ideal to use on the go.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra start at $999 and $1199, respectively, and are available for preorder now.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung launched the LTE version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch FE,</a> which was introduced earlier this year. The watch is available in three colors and retails for $249.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg kicked off Meta Connect 2024 by unveiling the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a>, a more affordable version of the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> VR headset. The new model features a similar design with a different lens array up front, and it&apos;s powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 chip. Meta cut costs by using cheaper lenses with lower resolutions and a narrower field of view. It also uses a software-based depth sensor and has a smaller battery, but you should still be able to play the same games as the flagship model.</p><p>The Quest 3S starts at $299 for the 128GB model and also comes in a 256GB model. Meanwhile, the Quest 3 is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-drops-128gb-quest-3-lowers-the-512gb-price-to-a-sweet-dollar499">only available in a 512GB version</a>, which now costs $499, the same as the now-discontinued 128GB model.</p>

<p>Meta also showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion AR glasses</a>, which are currently in development. The glasses display holographic images over the real world, allowing you to interact with them. The glasses use AI to accurately determine what you&apos;re looking at and help you identify items. You can also do things like video chat with friends or check messages, and even play AR games with others.</p><p>The glasses are larger and thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> but much smaller than other efforts. However, they&apos;re still in development, and it&apos;s unclear when Meta will release them to the public.</p>

The buds and case are also IP54-rated, and there&apos;s ChatGPT integration for queries.</p><p>The buds are available now for preorder and cost $149.</p>

However, there have been some issues with the rollout, prompting Google to press pause on the update.</p><p>Some users have been complaining about the update bringing their devices, with one user saying their Pixel Watch 2 was unresponsive after updating, showing only a blank screen with a Bluetooth symbol. One Pixel Watch owner says the update took nearly four hours to complete but functioned just fine when it was done.</p><p>Not everyone experienced problems with the update, but the issues were enough for Google to pull the update while it works out the problems. Meanwhile, affected users can check out this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13575675">support page</a> to hopefully fix their devices.</p>

Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> is following suit with a similar policy of its own, going live in the U.S. and other regions.</p><p>Disney <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/">says</a> that a subscription "is meant to be used within your Household, which is a collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside there." That means anyone else wishing to access Disney Plus will have to either get their own account or be added on as an extra member for $6.99 a month, at least for a Basic account. Premium members will have to pay $9.99 for an extra account outside their household. It should be noted that account holders can only have one extra member.</p><p>According to Disney, the new policy is available in the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission is cracking down on deceptive AI practices and launched legal action against companies making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">false AI claims</a> or offering tech that can be easily misused for fraud.</p><p>Operation AI Comply, the FTC&apos;s new program, has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes" target="_blank">uncovered</a> five cases where companies used AI to boost deceptive practices. These include a so-called "robot lawyer," AI-generated fake reviews, and shady online storefronts.</p><p>One case involves DoNotPay, which claimed to have the “world’s first robot lawyer” that could sue anyone with just a click. Now, the FTC is scrutinizing the company for not following through on its promises.</p><p>DoNotPay offered services like using a virtual card to dodge free trial fees and filing complaints against businesses. However, the FTC claims it exaggerated its capabilities, saying things like users could "sue for assault without a lawyer" and quickly create valid legal documents.</p><p>The FTC has called out DoNotPay for making baseless claims that its &apos;robot lawyers&apos; could replace human lawyers in creating legal documents. DoNotPay had claimed it would "replace the $200 billion-dollar legal industry with artificial intelligence."</p><p>However, the FTC argues that DoNotPay had no evidence to back these claims. As a result, the company has agreed to a $193,000 settlement with the FTC.</p><p>The FTC is also going after companies that claimed AI could help people profit from online storefronts. One case involves Ascend Ecom, which supposedly misled individuals about their earning potential to lure them into investing in "risk-free" AI-driven business opportunities. The FTC claims Ascend Ecom didn’t honor its money-back guarantees when those investments didn’t pan out.</p><p>Besides the companies already mentioned, Ecommerce Empire Builders, Rytr, and FBA Machine are also being investigated by the FTC. The complaint against Rytr reveals that subscribers could use its AI platform to generate misleading fake reviews packed with false info that might mislead consumers. Some users ended up creating thousands of these questionable reviews.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ecommerce Empire Builders and FBA Machine tout that customers can cash in by investing in AI-powered online businesses. However, the FTC alleges that Ecommerce Empire Builders forces clients to sign contracts that stop them from leaving negative reviews.</p>

<p>Ever since the original iPad was released, I&apos;ve been intrigued and enthralled with the idea of having a slab of glass and metal at my disposal. In most instances, I prefer tablets that are smaller than my laptop but larger than whatever phone I end up carrying that day.</p><p>Before the days of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, this distinction was much easier and is probably why I still adore the Nexus 7. It just served a very distinct purpose and one that couldn&apos;t be served by either my phone or laptop. Unfortunately, we&apos;ve seen a downward trend in device sales across multiple product categories in recent years. However, tablets just experienced a surge that could prove the category is still alive and well.</p><p>Just before attending the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra</a> press event, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52611024">a new report</a> from the International Data Corporation (IDC) was released. In this report, the IDC shares that "the tablet market is forecast to grow 7.2% year over year." While that might not seem like much of a jump, it&apos;s actually outpacing PCs, which is expected to "grow 4.3% year over year in 2025." </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jUj3MnxsxyeFLLuwmfn4Nf" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-and-2021-ipad-pro.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra and Apple iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUj3MnxsxyeFLLuwmfn4Nf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering that there haven&apos;t been many innovations in the tablet space, I&apos;ve been trying to figure out why tablets are seeing a resurgence. There are a couple of different potential explanations for why this is the case, but first, let&apos;s look at why tablet sales suffered in the first place.</p><p>The obvious explanation for the downtrend was the end of the lockdown in 2021, but it&apos;s been three years since then. In that time, there really haven&apos;t been any game-changing device launches outside of the world of foldable phones, which makes the recent surge all the more surprising. After all, tablets remain slabs of glass and either plastic or metal, all with differing software experiences. </p><p>Arguably, Amazon and Google have pushed the envelope a bit further, expanding the capabilities of your tablets by turning them into smart home displays. Meanwhile, Samsung has mostly kept things "business as normal," while Apple still can&apos;t figure out how to implement proper multi-tasking on the extremely overpowered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">iPad Pro</a> lineup.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXgL486dKccGRiLFvMvLik" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-review-1-wide.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 with S Pen back silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXgL486dKccGRiLFvMvLik.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, despite this stagnation, why are tablets on the uptick? The first idea that came to mind is that it&apos;s likely been at least two or three years since people last purchased a tablet. That&apos;s a pretty decent upgrade period, somewhat falling in line with getting a new smartphone. </p><p>Another factor here is that Android has matured quite a bit in that timeframe. Not to mention that we didn&apos;t begin seeing the promise of longer software updates for devices until 2022. Samsung now offers seven years of updates, surpassing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>&apos;s three years of major OS upgrades and five years of security patches. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aPuow7pinnUbGJGAdaiLub" name="amazon-fire-7-2022-review-4.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire 7 (2022) with Fire HD 8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPuow7pinnUbGJGAdaiLub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other idea has more to do with the way that I look at tablets, as they can either operate as an extension of my phone or computer or by themselves. Leaning on Samsung again, both the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra can be used as standalone computing devices, even if you don&apos;t take advantage of what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> has to offer.</p><p>These have essentially turned into Android versions of the Microsoft Surface Pro; detachable keyboards and all. While I&apos;m less of a fan of iPadOS now than I once was, it&apos;s definitely possible to be productive, even with a bit less flexibility than what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> have to offer. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-dex-mode-classic-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Using Classic DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This doesn&apos;t really take Amazon into account, as the majority of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire Tablets</a> are cheap enough to the point that they&apos;re more stocking stuffers than anything else. Well, at least that&apos;s the idea with the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is the company&apos;s lone non-Kindle premium tablet. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, with a Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra, there&apos;s <em>almost</em> no limit to what can be accomplished. Here are the different combinations that I could think of:</p>
<ul><li>Use the tablet as a tablet, without fiddling with "pro" features.</li><li>With the cellular model, take the Tab S10 Plus anywhere and get work done.</li><li>Use Samsung DeX and enjoy a more desktop-like experience, including being able to plug it into an external display. </li><li>If you own a Galaxy phone, tablet, and laptop, Multi Control lets you use a single keyboard and mouse to interact with your devices.</li><li>Second Screen turns the Galaxy Tab into an external display for any Windows computer.</li><li>With the included S Pen, the Galaxy Tab can transform into a drawing tablet or digital notebook.</li></ul>
<p>I&apos;m sure if I thought about it longer, I could come up with even more things you can do with a flagship Galaxy Tab. But I think you get the idea.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve also been wondering why Samsung would opt to ditch the smaller 11-inch model of its flagship tablet lineup. If you&apos;ll notice, there is no base Galaxy Tab S10, just the Plus and Ultra. Just last year, the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Tab S9</a> finally gained an OLED display while offering decent battery life and top-shelf performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK" name="ipad-pro-2024-imore.jpg" alt="2024 iPad Pro M4 on desk with Magic Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gerald Lynch / iMore)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was something I really couldn&apos;t figure out until I looked at the other Galaxy Tabs that are currently available. I&apos;m not sure if Samsung will keep the Galaxy Tab S9 lineup around, but at the time of this writing, all three models can still be purchased. </p><p>Moving further down Samsung&apos;s price bracket, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus</a> and its 12.4-inch screen retail for $599, while the 10.9-inch Tab S9 FE is $449. The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus rounds out the pack with an 11-inch display and a $319 price tag. </p><p>Admittedly, it does leave a rather large gap, seeing as the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus starts at $999. What I suspect is that the Galaxy Tab S9 will remain in the lineup, offering an option to those who want the best performance in a smaller form factor. But if you want the latest and the greatest, then you&apos;re probably okay with paying more and getting larger screens. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KyVBAL4fUyTDpxsCdBuErZ" name="oneplus-pad-2-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with keyboard accessory next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KyVBAL4fUyTDpxsCdBuErZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I&apos;ve been primarily focusing on Samsung tablets, the reality is that there are definitely more options to choose from that don&apos;t just suck. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a> was the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tablet, while the rather interesting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a> is slated to be released in mid-October.</p><p>Lenovo has its own massive lineup of tablets to choose from, ranging from the Tab M8 for $99 and maxing out with the Tab Extreme at $1,099. Currently, there are nine different Lenovo tablets to choose from, coming in a variety of sizes and slotting in amongst the various price brackets. </p><p>This is to say that maybe the reason there&apos;s a resurgence in tablet sales has to do with the sheer number of solid options available. If you want to be productive, then there&apos;s the iPad Pro, Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-tab-extreme-will-challenge-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra" target="_blank">Lenovo Tab Extreme</a>. Need something on a budget but not at the bottom of a barrel? Well, you have an almost never-ending stream of options. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3HPQpanRc6kHcuRNCZodKP" name="google-pixel-tablet-home-assistant-dashboard.jpg" alt="Home Assistant Dashboard on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3HPQpanRc6kHcuRNCZodKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amazon manages to straddle a few categories of its own, such as turning a Fire Tab into an Alexa smart display. While I do hope to see a refresh, you can either let the Pixel Tablet pull double duty as a smart home hub or use a regular Google tablet if you forgo the dock.</p><p>Regardless of the actual reason, if there is one, I&apos;m happy to see tablets getting a bit of the spotlight, especially when other categories of devices are slowing to a crawl. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-meta-connect-2024">yearly developer conference</a> and surprise — a big focus was placed on AI. It will be introducing features that resemble what we see from other tech companies with improved voice recognition, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">photo scanning</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-just-got-a-bunch-of-ai-upgrades-and-live-translation">live translation</a> as some of the highlights.</p><p>It sounds a lot like what we see from Google. It&apos;s also the same potential privacy nightmare and abuse of consumer data that applies to the same tools from Google. And it will be presented the very same way through the terms of service you are forced to agree with to use the products.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">said this over and over</a> and others have, too. You have to read the things you&apos;re agreeing to. Especially this time.</p><p>I&apos;m not a fan of big tech or its fascination with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">intrusive AI</a>. Amazon, Google, Apple, OpenAI, and the rest have their best interests in mind and try to provide services you want to use so they can profit from the user data you supply. That&apos;s why features are presented the way they are and try to entice you into using them.</p>
<p>That&apos;s fine if there&apos;s mutual benefit, and only you get to decide that. I always use myself as an example; I use Google&apos;s products and services.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I hate the amount of data Google collects and don&apos;t like everything the company does with it. In return, I get to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">products I find useful</a>. I&apos;d much rather pay real money to use these products and skip the excessive data collection, but that&apos;s not an option. I opt out of anything that doesn&apos;t interest me and begrudgingly allow the rest because I benefit.</p><p>Plenty of folks don&apos;t feel this way and try not to use Google&apos;s products, and I don&apos;t use Amazon&apos;s (for example) because the benefits aren&apos;t there for me. Nobody is right or wrong here because we each get to decide for ourselves.</p>
<p>You have to make an informed decision, though. It&apos;s foolish to think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-cant-trust-facebook">a company like Meta</a> has developed and released these features for free out of kindness or philopatry. Meta may not want to harm society, but it cares most about how the company itself will benefit.</p><p>No company will risk stealing user data and abusing it without permission. Even when done inadvertently there are often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tracking-private-incognito-browsing-lawsuit-proceeding">brutal punishments</a> doled out by the courts for breach of trust issues. And there should be. Everything Meta collects and everything it does with it once collected is written in the terms and conditions for you to read. If you agree, you have given your blessing.</p>
<p>The one thing here that&apos;s a little different is the language used in those terms. To their credit, Google and Apple use language that&apos;s easy to understand when it comes to company policy, and Microsoft is getting there. We should remember that when we decide what tech ecosystem to buy into. I know I do because this means a lot and promotes a level of trust.</p><p>Meta is not on this list. Meta has a bad habit of writing difficult-to-understand policy documents and hiding them behind links to other documents. Long-time users of Meta products like Facebook will also remember how any updates reset all your privacy features. To return them to work the way you wanted meant you needed to go through them page by page. The company was hoping you wouldn&apos;t bother.</p>
<p>I&apos;m sure that Meta understands what this looks like to consumers. I&apos;m equally sure the company doesn&apos;t care because it knows almost everyone will click or tap the button that says "I agree" and allow them to do whatever they like.</p><p>I&apos;m saying you shouldn&apos;t. The articles you read about how bad Meta&apos;s AI features are from a privacy perspective often leave this important detail out. They&apos;re only bad if you want them to be, just like Google&apos;s, Apple&apos;s, or Amazon&apos;s.</p>

The S10 Plus includes a vivid 12.4-inch AMOLED screen, or you can upgrade to the Ultra for a 14.6-inch display. Both plus configurations include 12GB of RAM, and you can choose between 256GB or 512GB of storage.</p>

<p>At first glance, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus looks like it's going to be another great premium tablet effort from Samsung, following in the footsteps of the S9 series. For those who pre-order the Plus variant, Samsung is offering up to $700 off with an eligible device trade-in, which is a good deal for those who have such a device. You can also get an extra 50% off on the keyboard book cover when you bundle it with the S10 Plus.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a Samsung Galaxy tablet that comes with the S Pen; you want the latest in premium-level tablets but don&apos;t mind going with the Plus instead of the Ultra, to save a few bucks; you have other tablets, phones, or computers that are in good enough shape to trade them in.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather save money on a previous-generation or A series Galaxy Tab; you have extra money to spend and want the larger screen on the Ultra; you prefer Pixel or other brand tablets to those from the Samsung Galaxy lineup.</p><p>We reported on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">leaked Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra</a> last month, as well as the long-held speculation that Samsung might be dropping its base-level configuration. Now, speculation has become a reality with the launch of pre-orders, which now only include the Plus and Ultra, as expected. Samsung is also pushing its AI features, and it&apos;s worth noting that the S10 Plus and Ultra both come with the S Pen again.</p><p>On the hardware side, the S10 Plus is fairly similar, though Samsung has switched to the slightly-faster MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus Octa Core processor over the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 included with the S9 models. Otherwise, the microSD slot can now support expandable storage of up to 1.5TB instead of just 1TB.</p><p>Aesthetically, it&apos;s also pretty much the same size and design as the S9 Plus, with the exception of the launch of two slightly different colors: moonstone gray and platinum silver.</p><p>All in all, this might be a pick worth considering if you have something to trade in, or if you don&apos;t mind pre-ordering it outright.</p>

<hr>
<p>All eyes were on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S</a> at Meta Connect 2024, but a new way to wear the Meta Quest 3 has the potential to be one of the biggest drops of the conference. Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-3-open-facial-interface/" target="_blank">announced</a> it is selling an official "open facial interface" for the Quest 3, which will give it an open-periphery experience similar to that of the Meta Quest Pro. When the Quest Pro is soon discontinued, the Quest 3 plus the open facial interface will be the official way to comfortably enjoy a Meta headset with open sides. </p><p>The open facial interface costs $40, and can be pre-ordered from Meta&apos;s website. If you order now, the estimated ship date is currently set for mid-October. Unfortunately, the open facial interface is only compatible with the Quest 3, not the new Quest 3S. The cheaper Quest 3S does have a "breathable facial interface" available, but the open design of the new Quest 3 facial interface could&apos;ve given users the illusion of a wider field-of-view. </p><p>Now, there are three official ways to wear the Meta Quest 3. There&apos;s the default facial interface that comes in the box with the Quest 3, which is designed for everyday use. Then, you have the silicone facial interface sold separately for $40, made for workouts and high-activity games. The new entrant into the lineup is the open facial interface, which Meta says is best for spatial experiences. For what it&apos;s worth, the open facial interface is also the lightest of the trio, weighing just 60 grams. </p>

<p>Android Central&apos;s own Nick Sutrich tried the new open facial interface at Meta Connect, and recounted that it completely eliminated lens fogging issues. Additionally, it gave the feel of an open periphery, yet it didn&apos;t quite match the Quest Pro experience. The open sides of the Quest Pro leave nothing touching your face, but there is facial padding on the open facial interface for the Meta Quest 3. </p><p>Interestingly, the breathable facial interface for the Meta Quest 3S also eliminated lens fogging. It doesn&apos;t provide the same level of open periphery as the open facial interface, since it&apos;s fully enclosed. However, since the breathable fabric does allow for some light to come through, it gives the wearer a sense of soft periphery. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-breathable-facial-interface-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the new breathable facial interface for the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These new ways to wear the Meta Quest 3, and the more affordable Quest 3S, will be crucial as we head into the next year. The 128GB Quest 3 and the Quest Pro are set to be discontinued, so the 512GB Quest 3 plus the open facial interface will be the official way to get open periphery during spatial experiences moving forward.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7An72xHvYiHsAZzhEXkwe9" name="Meta-Open-Facial-Interface-2.jpg" alt="The open facial interface for the Meta Quest 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7An72xHvYiHsAZzhEXkwe9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta&apos;s approach to designing the open facial interface tries to blend the best of open periphery and enclosed fabric seals. Third-party solutions already exist to help Meta Quest 3 owners use their headset without a facial interface, but Meta&apos;s intention is to give users the comfort and stability of a facial interface while providing  open side views. Again, it&apos;s not quite like the Meta Quest Pro, although the idea is similar. </p><p>It&apos;s impossible to compare the Meta Quest 3 and the Apple Vision Pro headsets, and yet it&apos;s clear that the latter and visionOS are impacting the former. Meta is trying out and pushing spatial experiences on the Quest 3 more since Vision Pro was released. As Apple Vision Pro owners have learned, spatial experiences that use mixed reality or simply passthrough video are better with open periphery. Where the displays end, your peripheral vision begins. </p><p>So, for those that like to use their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> for spatial computing or mixed-reality experiences, the $40 open facial interface could be a game-changer. There will surely be people who are still interested in using their Quest 3 without a facial interface at all, but Meta is offering a best-of-both-worlds solution. You can eliminate lens fogging and view your surroundings with the open facial interface and preserve comfort at the same time. </p><p>Even with the open facial interface, Meta will still be leaving a hole in its virtual reality lineup when the Quest Pro is discontinued. It wasn&apos;t a success by any means, but its open feel did make for a one-of-a-kind experience. For now, the $40 open facial interface and the $500 Meta Quest 3 will have to do. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s two past-gen Pixel Watches have encountered unsightly problems following the Wear OS 5 update. Due to this, the company has reportedly paused its major software update for the original Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2. Google confirmed as much to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/27/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-pulled/">9to5Google</a> today (Sept 27). According to the post, the company says the software update has bricked some users&apos; devices.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told the publication, "...in the meantime, we have paused the WearOS 5 rollout and are actively working on a resolution."</p><p>We&apos;ve heard reports of these, courtesy of members from the Android Central forums. One user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update#:~:text=FROM%20THE%20FORUMS-,goombah88,-I%20just%20got">goombah88</a>, stated, "I just got the update and it bricked my PW2. I have a black screen with a Bluetooth symbol at the bottom with a line through it." The user continued, saying they lost swiping functionality and that long-pressing the crown to reboot/shutdown didn&apos;t help.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update#:~:text=REPLY-,SeeBeeEss,-goombah88%20said%3A">follow-up comment</a> from another user states their O.G. Pixel Watch took roughly four hours to complete the Wear OS 5 update from Tuesday (Sept 24). It doesn&apos;t seem as though their device locked up following the patch, which is something 9to5 stated, as well.</p><p>Not every device suffers from this problem; however, its existence for some is enough cause for concern.</p><p>While Google toils away at a potential fix for the Wear OS 5 issue, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/25/wear-os-5-pixel-watch-issues/">publication cited</a> a Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13575675">support page</a> for fixing a "blank or frozen" Pixel Watch. This <em>should </em>relieve your device from any software-based problems. If it doesn&apos;t, Google&apos;s support line is your next course of action.</p>

<p>This development over the past three days is unfortunate considering past-gen Pixel Watch users have been waiting for Wear OS 5 all year. Google dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update">the update on September 24</a>, which included the monthly security patch. It was a major patch for devices rocking OS 3.5 or OS 4 and fixed numerous bugs across the past-gen devices.</p><p>More importantly, Wear OS 5 was the star of the major update. Google teased that there were "new features," but it didn&apos;t specify. The post alerted us to updates to the grid-view app launcher, camera controls, and Pixel Recorder functionality.</p><p>Originally, the Wear OS 5 update was supposed to continue hitting watches over the next week. However, with what&apos;s currently plaguing devices, that&apos;s not happening anymore. We can only hope that Google figures out the issue and solves it quickly. Right now, Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 owners attempting to update their devices will find nothing available.</p>

However, the only true competition that Samsung has seen, comes from a little company out in Cupertino, California, aka Apple. Samsung is hopeful that with its pending launch of the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra, it will be able to pull ahead of Apple and maintain its dominance on the Android side.</p><p>Before getting into the nitty gritty, the first major surprise is that Samsung is opting to forgo the 11-inch model. That leaves us with the 12.4-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, and the massive 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Although we don’t know the explicit reason behind this decision, we can surmise that it has something to do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Tab S9 FE</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-briefly-shows-up-in-us">Tab A9 Plus</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o3FWWt8u98hL9DdDQbnBuD" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-ai-features-presentation.jpg" alt="Galaxy AI features on Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3FWWt8u98hL9DdDQbnBuD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically what it seems to boil down to is that if you want a smaller tablet, then the FE is the way to go. Otherwise, you’ll need to spring for the larger and more “premium” options. </p><p>With that out of the way, Samsung spent a good amount of time emphasizing a couple of things. The first of which was how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Galaxy Tablets</a> help to provide an all-encompassing ecosystem while being able to do much more than just act as a media playback device. No, we aren’t talking about any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>-like experiences, although the idea of a tablet that doubles as a SmartThings hub is rather intriguing.</p>
<h2 id="take-all-of-the-galaxy-ai-you-can-handle-2">Take all of the Galaxy AI you can handle</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="phRqnQkmNTVPVsnZu7jLea" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-sketch-to-image-tree-2.jpg" alt="Sketch to Image results on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/phRqnQkmNTVPVsnZu7jLea.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, we were inundated with an almost constant barrage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> comments and blurbs. According to Samsung, 75% of its customers have “engaged with AI features” and there were “18 million uses of Galaxy AI in one week.” Those numbers are downright impressive, especially when considering that they only apply to Samsung’s U.S. market. </p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung also stated that there are already more than 100 million Galaxy AI-enabled devices available. More importantly, the company hopes to double that number “by the end of this year.” It’s a lofty goal, for sure, but if there’s one company that could follow through, it’s Samsung. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sRP92sHQSTYy9GbQkeypVU" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-circle-to-search-bar.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Circle to Search bottom bar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRP92sHQSTYy9GbQkeypVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In order to do so, that means getting Galaxy AI into the hands of more people, whether it be through software updates or releasing new devices. Samsung is opting for both, which started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">One UI 6.1.1</a> on the software side, and the push is continuing with the four devices announced.</p><p>So just where does the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra fit into the equation? Well, think about all of the features that launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and imagine them on much larger screens. Circle to Search is here, along with Sketch to Image, Smart Select, and even “AI-based Dialogue Boost.”</p>
<h2 id="new-year-mostly-same-design-2">New year, (mostly) same design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oEpb3ckduFfXMxuDfqquaQ" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-cameras-s-pen-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra S Pen and Cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oEpb3ckduFfXMxuDfqquaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When looking at the hardware, you would be hard-pressed to be able to tell the difference between last year’s models and these new ones. The dimensions aren’t exactly identical, but they are pretty darn close.</p><p>The first semi-noticeable difference comes in the form of the Anti-Reflective display, which was first introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Unfortunately, it’s something that’s rather difficult to capture on camera when you’re in a room surrounded by overhead key lights. However, I did notice that depending on the angle, the glare coming off of the screen wasn’t <em>as bad</em> compared to looking at the Galaxy S24 FE or my own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. </p><p>It’s not like this should really come as much of a surprise, but Samsung still makes some of the most vibrant displays that I’ve ever laid eyes on. That trend continues with the Tab S10 Ultra, and I can only presume this will also be the case with the Tab S10 Plus. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to see or use the smaller of the two, leaving me wondering if Samsung simply cares more about the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Generative Edit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides that, we have the same array of buttons around the frame, along with the quad-speaker array, and USB-C charging port on the bottom. On the back, both the Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra offer dual rear cameras, with the magnetic S Pen strip placed just to the left.</p><p>While it’s definitely possible, it’s also a bit comical when you pick up the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with one hand. It’s really not designed for this, but chances are you won’t be standing in the middle of a crowded room trying to hold it with one hand while using the S Pen with the other. </p><p>Then again, if you’re using a 14.6-inch tablet, chances are that you won’t be trying to use it with just one hand. This brings us to the keyboard case, which is an area of some disappointment. </p>
<h2 id="new-but-old-keyboard-case-2">New, but old, keyboard case</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kikB59qQzKXw4sb5dFvwrT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-galaxy-ai-key-1.jpg" alt="Galaxy AI key on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kikB59qQzKXw4sb5dFvwrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I mentioned before, Samsung is serious about trying to get everyone and anyone using Galaxy AI. Seemingly following in the footsteps of Microsoft with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-windows-copilot-key-pc-keyboard-announcement-2024">Windows Copilot button</a>, there’s a new Galaxy AI button on the keyboard. I’m not sure if it was the intended function, but when pressed, the Google Gemini app would appear. </p><p>It’s possible this was just for today’s demonstration, but I’m also curious as to where Bixby plays a role in all of this. Nevertheless, it’s not all that surprising to see, especially considering that the Copilot has been implemented on practically every Windows laptop released this year. </p><p>One thing I did notice when looking at the Tab S10 Plus and Ultra product page is that it seems that the “new” Book Cover Keyboard might actually be compatible with the Tab S9 Plus and S9 Ultra. This was one of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-tired-of-buying-new-cases">big gripes</a> when going from the Tab S8 Ultra to the Tab S9 Ultra, so maybe Samsung is actually listening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GifpZtZdukKgDiB8zxcv2a" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-side-profile-in-case.jpg" alt="Side profile view of Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GifpZtZdukKgDiB8zxcv2a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Book Cover Keyboard is backward compatible, that’s great for Tab S9 Plus and Ultra owners. What isn’t great is that it didn’t feel like much else had been done to improve the overall design. The last two iterations have been great when using them on a desk or a rigid surface, but things immediately <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">begin to fall apart</a> when using the Book Cover Keyboard on your lap. </p><p>I didn’t have the opportunity to sit back on a couch and use the Keyboard, so it’s something I’m looking forward to testing out when it’s time for a review. At this point, I’m not sure what other direction Samsung could go in, save for just “borrowing” Apple’s iPad Pro Smart Keyboard design. </p>
<h2 id="a-big-surprise-2">A big surprise</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NomFtENrt2o622kREhNw3Q" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-processor-presentation.jpg" alt="MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus on the Galaxy Tab S10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NomFtENrt2o622kREhNw3Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3136" height="1764" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another surprise was that Samsung opted against using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in its flagship tablet lineup. Instead, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>, paired with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of expandable storage. Speaking of which, kudos to Samsung for continuing to include a microSD card slot with its tablets, even if I still believe it should’ve never been removed from Galaxy phones.</p><p>Anyways, Samsung claims the Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC provides an 18% boost in CPU performance, 28% better GPU performance, and 14% improved NPU performance. All of that is paired with a “Larger Vapor Chamber,” in an effort to cut on the potential for overheating. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-dex-mode-classic-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Using Classic DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wasn’t able to really “put this to the test” in my brief time with the Tab S10 Ultra, but everything felt as snappy as I expected. If anything, I did notice that loading into the “classic” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> mode seemed faster than I thought, something that was echoed by others at the event. </p><p>The decision to move from Qualcomm to MediaTek for its flagship tablets had to have been for a good reason. But, it was interesting to see three new Samsung Galaxy devices announced, none of which are being powered by a Snapdragon chip.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sK9hDfZuHLUXcWT2CgtK4Y" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hdr-video-playback-2.jpg" alt="HDR VIdeo Playback on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sK9hDfZuHLUXcWT2CgtK4Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All-in-all, I’m not really disappointed that Samsung stuck to a slightly tweaked design, and even saying that surprises me. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the poster child for premium Android tablets, and there’s really not much that can compete in this price bracket. </p><p>With hardware that’s already refined, Samsung is doing exactly what I expected, as it’s putting more of a focus on software. More importantly, it’s all about Galaxy AI and Samsung looking to find ways for its customers to actually make use of these features. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With the exception of the Galaxy S22, we’ve seen Samsung release a Fan Edition of its flagship smartphone every year since 2020. Back then, the FE was seen as a “flagship killer” of sorts, offering incredible value compared to the “regular” Galaxy devices. Last year’s Galaxy S23 FE was no exception, but I’m not sure if the same can be said about the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><p>Understandably, Samsung cut corners in different areas, while simultaneously sprinkling in some of the same features and specs shared by the Galaxy S24 FE’s more expensive counterpart. To be frank, after spending some time with Samsung’s latest phone, I came away feeling a bit confused. </p>
<h2 id="the-galaxy-s24-fe-looks-really-familiar-xa0-2">The Galaxy S24 FE looks really familiar </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="inn2brzTWTMaKiHcFYu3UA" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-colors-4.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/inn2brzTWTMaKiHcFYu3UA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s get some of the basics out of the way. Samsung slimmed down the bezels a bit, resulting in the S24 FE sporting a 6.7-inch display. This matches up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> while being 0.3 inches larger than the S23 FE. Samsung’s Dynamic AMOLED makes its return, offering a 120Hz refresh rate, and is HDR10+ compliant. However, in a year where one of the focuses seems to be on making screens brighter, the S24 FE is no different, as it’s capable of reaching up to 1900 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Much like the Galaxy Tab S10 series, it’s difficult to really notice any differences between the S24 FE and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">S23 FE</a>. Making matters even more confusing, good luck trying to tell the S24 FE apart from even the S24 Plus from earlier this year. There are some very minor differences in dimensions, not to mention the variances in color options, but again, from an appearance standpoint, it’s pretty darn similar. </p><p>I bring this up because it’s part of the reason why I’m confused about Samsung’s direction. Sure, these two phones aren’t <em>actually</em> the same, even if they share many similarities. Which, by the way, includes the S24 FE “borrowing” the 50MP primary camera from the Plus. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good thing to see, it just continues to leave me scratching my head. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2759px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Co8gKBVaf3LT6mpvsXUMNH" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on-exynos-2400e.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos 2400e for Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Co8gKBVaf3LT6mpvsXUMNH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2759" height="1552" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I’ve mentioned, there are differences to be found, but you won’t see them at first glance. The biggest change is Samsung making the switch away from Qualcomm, but instead of opting for a MediaTek chip, Samsung’s own Exynos 2400e is at the helm with the S24 FE. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, just like the S23 FE, but offering less RAM than the S24 Plus.</p><p>Although it might come as a surprise to those of us here in the U.S., the reality is that this isn’t anything new for Samsung phones. In regions and markets outside of the States, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus are powered by the Exynos 2400. At the end of the day, the only thing between the Exynos 2400 and 2400e, is that Samsung lowered the clock speeds of the latter by 100MHz (3.21GHz vs. 3.11GHz.) </p>
<h2 id="galaxy-ai-for-everyone-2">Galaxy AI for everyone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bNTdhCtKCibQXPvVFyJVaH" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-generative-edit-1.jpg" alt="Generative Edit on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNTdhCtKCibQXPvVFyJVaH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, Samsung continued to drive home the idea that Galaxy AI should be easily accessible and readily available for anyone and everyone. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> had their time to shine, those features are now making their way to more affordable smartphones. </p><p>You won’t find hardly any features on the S24 FE that aren’t already available on Samsung’s other 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship devices</a>. This includes the likes of Generative Edit, Portrait Studio, Instant Slow-mo, Circle to Search, and other key Galaxy AI features. </p>

<p>What remains to be seen is how the S24 FE will hold up over time, especially as Galaxy AI expands. Perhaps more importantly, I have to wonder how long it will be before we see Samsung introduce new Galaxy AI features, but leave the S24 FE behind. </p><p>It’s an important question to ask, as the Galaxy S24 FE is getting the same treatment as its more expensive counterparts. Samsung announced that its latest phone will receive seven years of software and security updates. It’s great to hear and to see on paper, but only time will really tell how much performance degradation there will be when Android 22 and One UI 13 roll out. </p>
<h2 id="the-exynos-2400e-feels-snappy-2">The Exynos 2400e feels snappy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fE5ZkSrbQBnSu2izVi3PBB" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-dual-recording-1.jpg" alt="Dual Recording on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fE5ZkSrbQBnSu2izVi3PBB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the meantime, the Galaxy S24 FE felt just as fast and snappy as you’d expect from a brand-new phone. That included messing around with some of the Galaxy AI features, such as Generative Edit, even if the end results weren’t what I expected. Then again, I kind of chalk this up to being a “victim of the environment” and don’t really put the onus on the S24 FE. </p><p>Super Slow-mo was another cool feature to see working in action, managing to easily capture and playback from someone else messing around with a Newton’s Cradle. The S24 FE never felt hot to the touch; it only felt warm because of the number of people passing their phones around to get different photos or try different things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C9Bj3t5G8hpmE69Jtb3Sy7" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-viewfinder.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE camera viewfinder" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C9Bj3t5G8hpmE69Jtb3Sy7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some things that we’ll just have to wait and test out, such as battery life, and putting the other Galaxy AI features through their paces. Seeing as I’m entrenched in the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">retro game emulation</a> on devices, I’m interested and excited to see whether I can use the S24 FE to enjoy some of the more modern Zelda games. </p>
<h2 id="looking-at-the-broader-picture-2">Looking at the broader picture</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EZNeT3bZfVUKMZsf63s7FL" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE with Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZNeT3bZfVUKMZsf63s7FL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so what is it about the Galaxy S24 FE that leaves me feeling confused? It all comes down to price. At retail, the S24 FE is $649.99, which would seem like a steal compared to the $999 retail price of the S24 Plus. When factoring in Samsung’s current trade-in offerings, you can get the former for $249 or the latter for $399. Again, this is a nod in the FE’s favor, as it should be. </p><p>But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">2024 holiday shopping season</a> is right around the corner, which means that you’re sure to find a deal <em>somewhere</em> for one of, if not both the S24 FE and the S24 Plus. On the one hand, the cheaper phone is probably going to be the better seller of the two. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QUvoddCA7TRFjo9FPRqPLG" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-cameras-close.jpg" alt="Close-up on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUvoddCA7TRFjo9FPRqPLG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if both phones are priced the same, would you rather have the phone that was released alongside two other flagships, or the one that’s positioned as being more budget-friendly? Not to mention that the S24 Plus does offer more RAM and storage in its base configuration, which will surely be beneficial in the long run. </p><p>I do think that there’s a place in Samsung’s portfolio for the Galaxy FE to exist. I just think that this would be a much more compelling option if the price was somewhere around $500-$550. It would make even more sense considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A33 5G</a> starts at $399, and while it seems to be a great phone and value, Samsung might be missing out on an opportunity. </p>

<p>If you&apos;ve been waiting to see whether REDMAGIC&apos;s newest gaming tablet would make its way to your country, you&apos;re probably in luck! Today (Sept 27), REDMAGIC announced that has launched its recent Nova Gaming Tablet for the international market, to nearly 50 countries and territories.</p><p>The REDMAGIC Nova features two RAM/storage configurations: 12/256GB and 16/512GB. According to a press release, the Nova tablet is available for $499 and $649, respectively.</p><p>Following its announcement today, REDMAGIC states consumers should prepare for the "Early Bird Offer" on October 7, though they don&apos;t specify what the offer price will be. The Open Sale begins on October 16, but early bird buyers will get early access on October 15.</p><p>Below is a snapshot of the regions where the REDMAGIC Nova tablet is available:</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/nubias-new-gaming-tablet-crushes-the-competition-with-a-premium-chipset-and-built-in-fan">REDMAGIC Nova Gaming Tablet</a> launched in China earlier this month. The tablet rocks a 10.9-inch display with a 2K resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. It also includes Qualcomm&apos;s top-of-the-line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC, which tops out at 3.4GHz.</p><p>According to REDMAGIC, the Nova Gaming Tablet hits an AnTuTu score of 2,352,902 and is "the only tablet capable of handling AAA games for serious gamers."</p><p>One tool to optimize REDMAGIC Nova performance is its built-in 20,000 RPM fan, a 3D heat pipe, and internal air ducts. REDMAGIC states this should "maximize cooling" as the tablet&apos;s internals dissipate heat buildup during longer gaming sessions. We&apos;ve seen similar efforts at maximizing cooling shine on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-redmagic-9-pro-launch">REDMAGIC 9 Pro</a>.</p><p>For the Nova, the company states its nine-layered cooling system and all-metal aviation body can reduce its core temperature by an estimated 25 degrees Celsius, or 77 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Additionally, the tablet packs a whopping 10,100mAh battery. REDMAGIC estimates the battery can last for nearly 19 hours; however, it might last roughly 10 hours with heavy gaming use. One slight difference is that the international variant offers an 80W charger instead of the 120W Chinese consumers received.</p><p>REDMAGIC detailed a few other specifications like a 50MP rear camera and a 20MP selfie lens. Thanks to its Game Space 9.0 software, users can seamlessly tune performance, switch graphics, and find accessory controls. The Nova Gaming Tablet is DTS:X Ultra certified, delivering "full range" 3D audio via four built-in speakers.</p><p>The REDMAGIC Nova Gaming Tablet appears to have the power and price necessary to challenge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, and we&apos;re excited to test it out! Samsung announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a> on Thursday, and that should be its main competitor.</p>
