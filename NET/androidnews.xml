                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>At GDC 2024, Google AI senior engineers Jane Friedhoff (UX) and Feiyang Chen (Software) showed off the results of their Werewolf AI experiment, in which all the innocent villagers and devious, murdering wolves are Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p>Friedhoff and Chen trained each LLM chatbot to generate dialogue with unique personalities, strategize gambits based on their roles, reason out what other players (AI or human) are hiding, and then vote for the most suspicious person (or the werewolf&apos;s scapegoat). </p><p>They then set the Google AI bots loose, testing how good they were at spotting lies or how susceptible they were to gaslighting. They also tested how the LLMs did when removing specific capabilities like memory or deductive reasoning, to see how it affected the results. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3SDTM62CYLaRU24BVSqPP9" name="Google-Werewolf-GDC-2024-panel-3.jpeg" alt="A slide during the GDC 2024 panel "Simulacra and Subterfuge: Building Agentic 'Werewolf'".

<p>The Google engineering team was frank about the experiment&apos;s successes and shortcomings. In ideal situations, the villagers came to the right conclusion nine times out of 10; without proper reasoning and memory, the results fell to three out of 10. The bots were too cagey to reveal useful information and too skeptical of any claims, leading to random dogpiling on unlucky targets.</p><p>Even at full mental capacity, though, these bots tended to be too skeptical of anyone (like seers) who made bold claims early on. They tracked the bots&apos; intended end-of-round votes after each line of dialogue and found that their opinions rarely changed after those initial suspicions, regardless of what was said. </p><p>Google&apos;s human testers, despite saying it was a blast to play Werewolf with AI bots, rated them 2/5 or 3/5 for reasoning and found that the best strategy for winning was to stay silent and let certain bots take the fall.</p><p>As Friedhoff explained, it&apos;s a legitimate strategy for a werewolf but not necessarily a fun one or the point of the game. The players had more fun messing with the bots&apos; personalities; in one example, they told the bots to talk like pirates for the rest of the game, and the bots obliged — while also getting suspicious, asking, "Why ye be doing such a thing?"</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7eWLrETnF2gn7QvuSVfN98" name="Google-Werewolf-GDC-2024-panel-4.jpeg" alt="A slide during the GDC 2024 panel "Simulacra and Subterfuge: Building Agentic 'Werewolf'".

<p>That aside, the test showed the limits of the bots&apos; reasoning. They would give bots personalities — like a paranoid bot suspicious of everyone or a theatrical bot that spoke like a Shakespearean actor — and other bots reacted to those personalities without any context. They found the theatrical bot suspicious for how wordy and roundabout it was, even though that&apos;s its default personality.</p><p>In real-life Werewolf, the goal is to catch people speaking or behaving <em>differently than usual</em>. That&apos;s where these LLMs fall short. </p><p>Friedhoff also provided a hilarious example of a bot hallucination leading the villagers astray. When Isaac (the seer bot) accused Scott (the werewolf bot) of being suspicious, Scott responded that Isaac had accused the innocent "Liam" of being a werewolf and gotten him unfairly exiled. Isaac responded defensively, and suspicion turned to him — even though Liam didn&apos;t exist and the scenario was made up. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bAFaboGoz9z3HxnphTF8tg" name="Gemini-multimodal.jpg" alt="Google's Gemini AI model" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bAFaboGoz9z3HxnphTF8tg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s AI efforts, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, have become smarter over time. Another GDC panel showcased Google&apos;s vision of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gcd-2024-google-pushes-devs-toward-genai-living-games">generative AI video games</a> that auto-respond to player feedback in real-time and have "hundreds of thousands" of LLM-backed NPCs that remember player interactions and respond organically to their questions. </p><p>Experiments like this, though, look past Google execs&apos; bold plans and show how far artificial intelligence has to go before it&apos;s ready to replace actual written dialogue or real-life players. </p><p>Chen and Friedhoff managed to imitate the complexity of dialogue, memory, and reasoning that goes into a party game like Werewolf, and that&apos;s genuinely impressive! But these LLM bots need to go back to school before they&apos;re consumer-ready. </p><p>In the meantime, Friedhoff says that these kinds of LLM experiments are a great way for game developers to "contribute to machine learning research through games" and that their experiment shows that players are more excited by <em>building</em> and teaching LLM personalities than they are about playing with them. </p><p>Eventually, the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">mobile games</a> with text-based characters that respond organically to your text responses is intriguing, especially for interactive fiction, which typically requires hundreds of thousands of words of dialogue to give players enough choices. </p><p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> with NPUs capable of AI processing could deliver speedy LLM responses for organic games, that could be truly transformative for gaming. This Generative Werewolf experiment is a good reminder that this future is a ways off, however.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve had my fair share of Chromebooks come across my desk, and Google has done a pretty great job at making my life easy. Whenever I sign in with my Google account, <em>almost</em> everything is synced from one Chromebook to the next.</p><p>Even still, there are a few things that I go through and set up in order to give myself access to all of the apps and features I care about. There&apos;s a good chance that you might not care about some of these, but I hope that you try out others just to see what&apos;s possible.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-updates-2">Check for updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UKwAqHxzNtB4QXAhyZjZW6" name="update chromeos feature 2.jpg" alt="ChromeOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UKwAqHxzNtB4QXAhyZjZW6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether it&apos;s a review unit or a Chromebook I&apos;ve purchased for myself, the first thing I do after signing in is to make sure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-update-chromeos">ChromeOS is up to date</a>. Your Chromebook should automatically do this whenever it&apos;s connected to Wi-Fi, making periodic checks and downloading available updates so you don&apos;t have to. But when you first get a ChromeOS device, you want to make sure you have access to all the latest features from the get-go.</p><p>Really, it&apos;s something that I recommend doing, no matter what kind of device you just picked up. </p><p>This way, I don&apos;t have to worry about trying to use a feature that I was using before, only to find that it&apos;s not there because the software is outdated. This also goes for any Android apps, so I fire up the Play Store and install any potential updates that are in waiting.</p>
<h2 id="review-my-apps-and-extensions-2">Review my apps and extensions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uEQBAr4qFKJnokD7EuzAGS" name="lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-productivity-launcher-16x9.jpg" alt="App Drawer on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEQBAr4qFKJnokD7EuzAGS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing you might have learned about me over the years, it&apos;s that I love installing and messing around with different apps. The same goes for Chrome extensions, albeit to a lesser extent. </p><p>I mean, Chrome already eats up all of my RAM as it is, and I don&apos;t need it getting worse. That being said, I go through my app drawer and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-manage-apps-your-chromebook">uninstall any apps</a> that I no longer need. What&apos;s the point of taking up space if it&apos;s something I&apos;ll never use? However, you should also be sure to remove or install Chrome extensions so that you can get the most out of your browsing experience.</p><p>Again, reviewing installed apps is something you should do on any device, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, which often come preinstalled with plenty of bloatware.</p>
<h2 id="linux-is-a-must-have-2">Linux is a must have</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozhw2qkcVbGRtMbTypuYTC" name="linux-pixelbook-go-hero-1-16x9.jpg" alt="Terminal app open on Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozhw2qkcVbGRtMbTypuYTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to the fact that a Chromebook is really just a Linux laptop, Google makes it incredibly easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">install and run Linux apps</a>. In doing so, this gives me access to more powerful applications than what I would find on the Play Store or on the web. One such example is being able to install GIMP for editing photos or Obsidian for writing articles and taking notes.</p><p>And don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s actually much easier than it sounds.</p>
<h2 id="switch-to-a-different-channel-2">Switch to a different channel</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V6RYcJF9T2zXqpCzTiZ9z" name="chromebook-plus-framework-laptop-chromebook.jpg" alt="Chromebook Plus upgrade on the Framework Laptop Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V6RYcJF9T2zXqpCzTiZ9z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the next section, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-switch-your-chromebook-developer-channel">switching from the Stable channel</a> on your Chromebook is <em>not</em> something that I recommend everyone else do. And by this, I mean the Beta or Dev channel, which provides access to new or upcoming features or those that might still be early in development. Part of why I do it can be blamed on my masochistic mentality when it comes to being on the "bleeding edge" of apps and software. </p><p>At the same time, doing so opens the doors for me to see and mess around with new features that might end up trickling down into the Stable build of ChromeOS. But again, it&apos;s not for the faint of heart, and one bad update could leave you with a mountain of frustration.</p>
<h2 id="tinker-with-flags-2">Tinker with flags</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gioRoE5fmvDKcF4ky9cxi4" name="google-chrome-flags-hero-landscape.jpg" alt="Chrome flags on Chromebook Duet and Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gioRoE5fmvDKcF4ky9cxi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, this one takes a bit of trial and error, but I <em>love</em> looking through the never-ending list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-flags-chrome">ChromeOS flags</a>, which are often the ways that you access many of the hidden, in-development features before they become more publicly available. It&apos;s definitely a "your mileage may vary" kind of situation, as some features could work while others might not. </p><p>Plus, depending on what Channel you&apos;re on, flags might appear that give us a glimpse at future ChromeOS features. At the same time, a really cool feature could show up only to be taken away with the next update, so you should always take what you see with a grain of salt.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-phone-hub-2">Set up Phone Hub</h2>

<p>I cycle through just about as many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> as I do Chromebooks. Because of that, it&apos;s a pretty good assumption that I&apos;m using a different phone by the time a new Chromebook arrives. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-phone-hub-on-chromebooks">Phone Hub</a> is an essential part of my daily workflow, and I need to make sure it&apos;s ready to go when I am.</p><p>Being able to view anything that comes through my phone from my Chromebook saves me time and helps me stay focused on whatever I&apos;m doing. Not to mention, recent updates to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> make it incredibly easy to transfer files and photos back and forth without waiting for them to be uploaded to Drive or Photos.</p>

<p>One of my biggest complaints about Chromebooks, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-models-now-available">Chromebook Plus</a> models, is that there just isn&apos;t enough built-in storage. Obviously, these are supposed to be cloud-first computers, but after setting up Linux and installing Steam, it&apos;s just not enough. Maybe it&apos;s mostly a "me" problem, and that&apos;s fine, but there are bound to be other Chromebook owners who feel my pain.</p><p>However, I&apos;m also very thankful that Google makes it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-microsoft-office-chromebook">use OneDrive</a> in addition to Google Drive. Between those two cloud storage solutions, I essentially have access to 4TB of storage on top of whatever size hard drive the Chromebook has. It&apos;s not a perfect solution, but it&apos;s still something.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-perks-2">Check for perks</h2>

<p>Most of the time, your new and shiny Chromebook comes with quite a bit more than whatever&apos;s in the box. Through the Explore app, there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-are-google-chromebook-perks">a few freebies</a> that are included. Most of the time, there will be a perk for three months of YouTube Premium or an additional 100GB of cloud storage through Google One. </p><p>But occasionally, something even better will come through the pipeline, such as a free GeForce Now trial or a discount code for a new app. At the very least, it never hurts to at least check and see what you could get for free.</p>
<h2 id="install-steam-2">Install Steam</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4QcDu3mvgq8BstXcdCwPBD" name="framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review-hades-steam-up-close.jpg" alt="Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition playing Hades on Steam with SteelSeries controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QcDu3mvgq8BstXcdCwPBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know that this doesn&apos;t really make much sense, given that I can just fire up GeForce Now or Xbox Game Pass to play a lot of my favorite games. However, even more than a year after being officially released, I still can&apos;t get over the fact that I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/play-steam-games-chromebook">Steam on my Chromebook</a>, which is a great way to play games on a machine that obviously wasn&apos;t built for it.</p><p>No, I still can&apos;t play games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Helldivers II. Thankfully, there are still enough great games that <em>will</em> run on many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>. And for those that don&apos;t, well, that&apos;s where cloud gaming services come into play.</p>

<p>We all might have our own gripes about Chromebooks and ChromeOS as a platform. But, there&apos;s no denying that it&apos;s continued to grow in both form and function. If you had told me five years ago that there would be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/frankenstein-framework-chromebox">Chromebook with interchangeable parts</a>, I probably would have laughed at you.</p><p>What makes this evolution even more incredible is that it was done without Google releasing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/see-ya-later-pixelbook-2">updated version of the Pixelbook</a>. Instead, Google is putting the hardware development into the hands of different laptop makers. However, at its core, Google is still steering the ship with ChromeOS.</p><p>If you just purchased your own Chromebook, hopefully my first steps can help guide you in setting up your machine just how you like it.</p>

<p>As Qualcomm just announced the Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 for the masses, OnePlus has finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/cn/ace-3v">introduced</a> a device featuring the same chipset, dubbed the OnePlus Ace 3V.

The back panel further appears different from the previous Ace/Nord phones with a new camera visor. It equips a primary 50MP Sony IMX882 sensor accompanied by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens. These cameras support 4K video at 60/30fps. The punch hole on the front carries a 16MP selfie shooter. </p><p>The punch hole display on the front is an AMOLED panel measuring 6.74 inches.

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want a big smartwatch with military-grade durability and outstanding battery life. </p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you have small wrists; you want Google Assistant or the latest Wear OS updates. </p><p>As we described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the TicWatch Pro 5 is "a beast of a smartwatch", combining excellent Wear OS performance with a clever design and battery life to stunning effect. There&apos;s a rotating crown with haptic feedback that is simply a joy to use, and the Pro&apos;s "Essential Mode" means that you&apos;ll still be able to utilize the watch&apos;s basic functions when it&apos;s low on juice. That feature alone could have earned the TicWatch Pro 5 a spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, but the bulky frame and lack of Wear OS 4 integration have given us considerable pause.</p><p>Still, if you&apos;d like a larger watch with multiple days of battery life and all of the software features you could ever need, the TicWatch Pro 5 is a great choice, especially when you pair it with a massive 35% discount.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung announces it has rebranded One UI&apos;s old "Game Launcher" on Galaxy phones to "Gaming hub for mobile."</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-gaming-hub-for-mobile-discover-and-play-instantly-on-galaxy-phone/">press release</a>, the rebrand brings Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Android phones</a> closer to the Gaming Hub users will find on its smart TVs and monitors. The Gaming Hub gives users access to "Instant Plays," which is a feature the original launcher had since it was available.</p><p>Samsung highlights the feature, stating mobile gamers will find "immediate access" to titles without downloading them. Instant Plays is still in a "limited" beta with a few select games for those in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Moreover, the Korean OEM states its mobile game streaming hub supports native Android APKs, existing in-game monetization models for gaming publishers, and cloud-based solutions for developers.</p><p>The hub&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/gaming-hub/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">official page</a> details familiar features, such as the ability to manage downloaded games, alerts for exclusive gaming perks, and coupons.</p><p>Samsung discussed furthering its ambitions in streaming mobile games for Galaxy users at the Gaming Developer Conference (GDC 2024). The company&apos;s corporate vice president, Jikhan Jung, stated, " Our vision for Gaming Hub for mobile is to provide an all-in-one gaming platform optimized for Galaxy owners that makes playing and discovering games much easier without downloading and waiting."</p>

<p>Samsung first announced its original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gaming-hub">Gaming Hub</a> for larger displays during CES 2022. The game-streaming discovery platform for smart TVs and more supports Xbox, GeForce Now, Utomik, and Amazon Luna. Users can seamlessly connect a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gaming-hub#:~:text=SAMSUNG%20GAMING%20HUB%3A-,SUPPORTED%20CONTROLLERS,-(Image%20credit%3A%20Nicholas">supported gaming controller</a> to stream popular games to their TVs without needing a console.</p><p>While this may not be mentioned, Galaxy users who are hopping into the Gaming Hub should still find controller support.</p><p>Samsung didn&apos;t specifically list anything new arriving for its Gaming Hub for mobile rebrand. However, the hub notably piggybacks off some AI gaming software for curated recommendations on its home screen. Perhaps there&apos;s more in store as the company continues to "innovate" on its game-streaming platform.</p>

<ul><li>A recent Google Keep version shows the company's plans to introduce a revamped toolbar to the app.</li><li>The floating, pill-shaped toolbar takes up less space and offers users three options: create a note, a list, and a drawing or picture note.</li><li>While the new toolbar takes up much less space, it will also remove a couple of options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s notetaking app, Keep, has started a test involving a redesigned bottom bar for users.</p><p>As detailed by AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Google-Keep-New-Bottom-Toolbar.html">TheSpAndroid</a>), Google is seemingly dropping the bottom UI toolbar in Keep in favor of a floating, pill-shaped alternative (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/21/google-keep-floating-bottom-bar/">9to5Google</a>). The latest test was discovered in Keep&apos;s recent 5.24.102 version. Surfacing the bar in Keep&apos;s code on Android showcased the new bar&apos;s three options: open a new note, create a list, and create a drawing or picture note.</p><p>This toolbar supposedly utilizes your Android phone&apos;s Dynamic Theme, meaning it will feature your desired color palette. The deep dive also showed that the plus icon for starting a new note features a neat animation when tapped.</p><p>While the new bar could be seen as a way of taking up less space on your display, Google has removed a couple of options alongside that. AssembleDeBug noted that the floating bar no longer contains options for voice notes, nor is there a dedicated photo button.</p><p>It&apos;s speculated that Google has popped both options inside the additional options menu (plus icon) when in a newly created note. The pill-shaped bar notably affects Keep in Landscape mode, as the test shows users should experience more content and less toolbar obstruction</p>

<p>Google went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-new-navigation-bar">down a similar road</a> with its messaging app Chat last November. The company rolled out a UI redesign for the app, revamping it with a floating, pill-shaped toolbar with several shortcuts. Users were able to quickly dive into their home panel, direct messages, spaces, and mentions.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is the second test Google has been spotted working on for Keep in recent times, with the first involving AI. In February, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-android-testing-help-me-create-a-list">started a test</a> to bring Gemini-powered features to Keep in the form of a "Help me create a list" feature. Similar to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help me write</a>," Keep&apos;s version is said to assist users in creating lists for shopping, things to do, and packing.</p><p>The app&apos;s code showed that users will eventually find a floating "help me create a list" button at the bottom of a new note. Users can then write a prompt detailing what they&apos;d like the AI bot to do. While it was suggested that users give "more specifics" to help the AI, personal information should be kept out of it.</p>

<ul><li>Information has leaked about which cores MediaTek could pack into its upcoming Dimensity 9400 flagship SoC.</li><li>Rumors suggest it could offer Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores, but its exact CPU layout is still unknown.</li><li>Previous rumors detailed its early benchmark scores, which saw MediaTek's chip beat Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 in one of the two tests.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information on MediaTek&apos;s upcoming response to Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 has leaked, showing us how the competition might shake down.</p><p>According to Digital Chat Station (DCS) on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/O637drBmr">Weibo</a>, MediaTek&apos;s next flagship SoC may feature Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/dimensity-9400-could-give-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-a-hard-time-as-more-details-about-the-chipset-surface/">WCCFtech</a>). DCS didn&apos;t go into detail about the chip&apos;s CPU layout, though there is some speculation.</p><p>The publication suggests the Dimensity 9400 could feature five X5 cores, three X4 cores, and four A7xx cores. We&apos;re still left wondering what speeds the Dimensity 9400 could clock in at.</p><p>The Weibo post concluded with rumors about MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC. DCS states the chip could offer a "super-large" Cortex-X4 at 3.4GHz. The chip may also launch in May.</p><p>If the rumors are true, it seems as though MediaTek is ditching the idea of efficiency cores for its flagship Soc — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">like last year</a>. However, the chip could offer further leaps over its predecessor, considering the speculation behind the inclusion of X5 cores. The Dimensity 9300 delivered four Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Cortex-A720 cores.</p><p>Previous rumors about the upcoming flagship chip suggest it will be built off a 3nm process instead of the last-gen&apos;s 4nm process. Moreover, early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">leaked benchmark results</a> suggest it could outperform Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. It was rumored in February that the Dimensity 9400 achieved a 2776 score on the single-core test and a score of 11,739 on the multicore test.</p><p>It&apos;s wise to take these results with caution until we know officially during the chip&apos;s official launch. Qualcomm&apos;s chip is expected to debut featuring its stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Oryon cores</a>, so that&apos;s another aspect to be aware of.</p><p>Meanwhile, MediaTek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-optimizes-dimensity-chips-for-gemini-nano">recently optimized</a> their Dimensity 9300 and 8300 chips for Gemini Nano&apos;s capabilities in conjunction with Google. While the former was designed with generative AI in mind, further tuning ensured Google&apos;s latest AI model could work seamlessly on devices with the previously mentioned chips.</p><p>Considering this, perhaps we can expect more AI influence in MediaTek&apos;s upcoming reveal. The company isn&apos;t expected to debut its Dimensity 9400 chip until later this year, potentially in October.</p>

<hr>
<p>After years of holding out, Samsung may have finally joined the seamless update party.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.themobileindian.com/news/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a55-5g-1st-samsung-phone-to-get-seamless-updates" target="_blank">The Mobile Indian</a>, the Galaxy A55 has become the first Samsung phone to receive a seamless Android update with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/second-galaxy-s24-software-update-is-out">latest March 2024 patch</a>. With this change, Samsung has introduced a split progress bar to show that the update is going on seamlessly.</p><p>Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman chimed in and shared some insights on X (formerly Twitter), noting that those who own Samsung&apos;s newest mid-range model are noticing this feature.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung may have finally implemented seamless updates on their Android devices! When updating the new Galaxy A55 5G, users have noticed that the software update screen now shows a "downloading and installing" as well as "verification" steps. In addition, @TheMobileIndian… pic.twitter.com/3Xk8iQZ3gz<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1770827713567158730">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>After checking out the software update screen, users noticed two stages of installation: the "downloading and installing" phase and the "verification" phase.</p><p>This means that you won&apos;t have to wait for ages as your phone installs system updates anymore. Your device will quietly install the update in the background, and all you&apos;ll need to do is restart your phone to apply it. It&apos;s a bit like what Google&apos;s been doing with its Pixels since the very first model.</p><p>Normally, when you download and install an update on a Samsung device, you need to restart your phone to finish it. And while that&apos;s happening, you&apos;re stuck not being able to use your device until it&apos;s all sorted.</p><p>However, it looks like some Galaxy A55 users were able to keep using their phones while the update was downloaded quietly in the background.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s adoption of seamless updates is not entirely a surprise. Back in 2022, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-working-on-seamless-updates-one-ui-6">Samsung executive spilled the beans</a> and confirmed that the company was cooking up plans to roll out seamless updates. It now looks like the company has finally made it happen.</p><p>What&apos;s really interesting is that Samsung decided to debut this feature on one of its mid-range phones instead of saving it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Galaxy models</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>While it looks like seamless updates are up and running on the Galaxy A55 now, Samsung hasn&apos;t rolled out this feature to all its devices just yet. However, there&apos;s a chance the South Korean tech giant might introduce it to other models through future updates.</p>

And instead of responding to these competitive threats by lowering the prices of its products for consumers, Apple has always wriggled its way out by imposing a series of "shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/doj-sues-apple-over-iphone-monopoly.html">CNBC</a>, The Justice Department said in a release that, to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple blocked cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility, and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.</p><p>"This case is about freeing smartphone markets from Apple&apos;s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future," the DOJ stated.</p>

<p>The complaint states that Apple protects its smartphone monopoly by degrading and undermining cross-platform messaging apps and rival smartphones. For ages, Apple has limited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-apple-imessage-gatekeeper-ruling">cross-platform messaging</a>, forcing people to use only Apple devices to communicate effectively and with one another. "Apple undermines cross-platform messaging to reinforce obstacle [s]to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones," the lawsuit states.</p><p>Apple could have made better cross-platform messaging more inclusive by allowing iMessage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a>, but the tech giant made people believe that doing so would hurt consumers more than help them. In 2013, Apple&apos;s SVP of software engineering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-considered-bringing-imessage-android-but-chose-not">explained</a> that supporting cross-platform OTT messaging in Apple Messages "would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones."</p><p>The company has since agreed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">support RCS messaging</a> on its platform later this year, although we still don&apos;t know the exact details about how this will be implemented. </p>

<p>The DOJ has also discussed the Apple Watch&apos;s incompatibility with Android devices and the limited capabilities of third-party smartwatches with the iPhone. The complaint alleges that "users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones."</p><p>The vice president of product marketing for the Apple Watch acknowledged that the smartwatch may help prevent iPhone users from switching to Android devices and continue to help them monopolize the market. According to the complaint, many surveys have reached similar conclusions: users say that the additional accessories linked to their iPhones are the reason they do not switch to Android.</p><p>The complaint also addresses how Apple has been restricting developers from offering cloud gaming apps to reduce dependence on the iPhone&apos;s expensive hardware.</p><p>Cloud streaming game apps let users run computationally intensive games without having to process or store them on their smartphones. This allows developers to bring technologies and services to smartphone consumers, including gaming and interactive artificial intelligence.</p><p>The lawsuit cites an Apple manager who complained that "all that matters is who has the cheapest hardware and consumers could buy a [expletive] Android for 25 bux at a garage sale and have a solid cloud computing device that works fine."</p>

<p>The case is being filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit">The Verge</a>, DOJ Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Apple has maintained "a chokehold on competition" and "smothered an entire industry" through its shift from "revolutionizing the smartphone market to stalling its advancement." </p><p>According to the New York Times, Apple has defended itself against other antitrust challenges by arguing that its policies are critical to making its devices private and secure. </p><p>The lawsuit could force Apple to embrace cross-platform collaboration finally. According to Ted Miracco, CEO,<strong> </strong>Approov<strong>,</strong> the Department of Justice, the EU, and the UK are all pursuing antitrust actions against Apple, highlighting that Apple&apos;s idea that it alone can provide security for the mobile ecosystem is unrealistic.</p>
<p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107784/apples-response-to-the-dojs-iphone-antitrust-lawsuit">The Verge</a>, Apple responded to the lawsuit, stating that it threatened its identity and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.</p><p>"At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love—designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users. This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets."</p><p>"If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering the government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it."</p>
