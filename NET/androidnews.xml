<p>It may be old, but the Moto G 5G 2023 still has everything you could want in a budget Android phone. It includes 5G support, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and much more, all at a price that's too good to resist.</p></p>

<p>Motorola&apos;s Moto G series smartphones are (and have always been) renowned for offering incredible value for money, and the brand-new Moto G 5G 2024 is no different. From a minimal software experience to amazing battery life, the newest Motorola phone brings a lot to the table. It even includes some features that are usually found in much more expensive smartphones, while costing just a penny shy of $200.</p><p>As great as that price is, the previous-gen Moto G 5G 2023 — which is still available for purchase — can now be had for just under $150. So, the question is, should you go for the latest and greatest thing in town, or just get the previous-gen model and save even more of your money? Let&apos;s compare the Moto G 5G 2024 vs. Moto G 5G 2023 and find out.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-5g-2024-vs-moto-g-5g-2023-design-and-display-2">Moto G 5G 2024 vs. Moto G 5G 2023: Design and display</h2>
<p>Although the newer model is a tad heavier, both the Moto G 5G 2024 and Moto G 5G 2023 have a virtually identical physical footprint and overall design. The two also have an all-plastic frame, as well as similarly placed ports and buttons. However, the moment you flip over the two phones, the biggest visual difference between them immediately becomes apparent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nfCxcrWtsgRsZFH9MroFsY" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-back-holding-02.jpg" alt="The back of the vegan leather Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfCxcrWtsgRsZFH9MroFsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G 5G 2024 features a vegan leather back, which is a massive improvement over the plastic rear of the previous-gen model. Sure, vegan leather is technically a form of plastic, but it looks and feels much more premium, while also keeping away dust and fingerprints. As noted by Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, this design choice makes the Moto G 5G 2024 stand out in a sea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200" target="_blank">Android phones priced under $200</a>, at least as far as looks are concerned.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2989px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nTkK4HpAy2gRAbS65eWmS" name="Moto-G-5G-2023-review-hero-wide.jpg" alt="Holding the Moto G 5G (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nTkK4HpAy2gRAbS65eWmS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2989" height="1681" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 6.6-inch display of the newer model is slightly larger than the 6.5-inch screen that you&apos;d find on the Moto G 5G 2023, but that&apos;s the only difference between them. They are both IPS LCD panels (if you prefer the deep blacks and rich colors offered by AMOLED screens, we suggest checking out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy A15 5G</a>) perfect for everyday use, and even though the display resolution is a little low (720p), you do get a 120Hz refresh rate for a better experience.</p>

<p>The Moto G 5G 2024 is powered by the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1, a newer and moderately better SoC than the Snapdragon 480+ 5G used by its predecessor. Disappointingly though, the RAM is still limited to 4GB. Although the chipsets are capable of handling daily-usage tasks like web browsing and light gaming, the paltry amount of RAM means you won&apos;t be able to multi-task or run resource-intensive apps particularly well on either of these phones. That said, both devices do come with 128GB of internal storage, along with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD cards</a> of up to 1TB.</p><p>Like its predecessor, the Moto G 5G 2024 packs in all the basics like Wi-Fi, multi-band 5G, stereo speakers, and a 3.5mm audio port. However, there&apos;s one extra addition that gives the newer model an edge over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2023-review" target="_blank">Moto G 5G 2023</a>, and that&apos;s NFC. Yep, you read that right! With the Moto G 5G 2024, you can make hassle-free contactless payments and leave your wallet at home.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bBGTbKxfiT9RD7LXhEQvzV" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-back-camera-island-02.jpg" alt="The vegan leather back of the Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bBGTbKxfiT9RD7LXhEQvzV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G 5G 2024 features a dual-lens rear camera setup with a 50MP primary sensor. In comparison, the Moto G 5G 2023 sports a 48MP primary sensor. The 50MP primary lens is the only one you should care about anyway because, like the last-gen model, the secondary sensor is a useless 2MP macro unit that doesn&apos;t do much.</p><p>The camera quality, as expected, is just about average, but you do get features such as dual capture, auto HDR, and more. Video recording is limited to 1080p (at 30fps), and the 8MP front-facing camera (same as that on the last-gen model) works well for selfies and video calls.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-5g-2024-vs-moto-g-5g-2023-software-and-battery-life-2">Moto G 5G 2024 vs. Moto G 5G 2023: Software and battery life</h2>
<p>Budget phones usually don&apos;t offer much in terms of software support, and the same is true for the Moto G 5G 2024 and Moto G 5G 2023 as well, with both devices being eligible for just one major OS update and up to three years of security updates. That said, since the Moto G 5G 2024 is the newer phone, it already comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review" target="_blank">Android 14</a> and will get Android 15 eventually. On the other hand, the Moto G 5G 2023 will stay on Android 14, since it launched with Android 13. If you like using your devices for a long time, this is definitely something worth taking into consideration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dntm8jFqeTsHXbyDXeBftM" name="Moto-G-5G-2023-review-4.jpg" alt="Moto G 5G (2023) outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dntm8jFqeTsHXbyDXeBftM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3814" height="2145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software itself is fairly stock-like, although it&apos;s spruced up with a diverse array of Motorola-exclusive improvements (e.g., quick gestures) that we&apos;ve come to love over the past few years.</p><p>Just like the last-gen model, the Moto G 5G 2024 comes with a big 5,000mAh battery. However, the charging speed has gone up to 18W (in comparison, the Moto G 5G 2023 charges at 15W) for even faster top-ups. Combine that with the power-efficient hardware, and the phone should easily last you a full day with moderately heavy use.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-5g-2024-vs-moto-g-5g-2023-should-you-upgrade-2">Moto G 5G 2024 vs. Moto G 5G 2023: Should you upgrade?</h2>
<p>With the Moto G 5G 2024, Motorola has hit yet another home run. It not only has all the essentials (e.g., 5G connectivity, awesome battery life), but also packs in goodies like NFC (for contactless payments via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet" target="_blank">Google Wallet</a>), while still costing less than what the Moto G 5G 2023 did at the time of its launch.</p><p>Speaking of the Moto G 5G 2023, the last-gen model can now be had for just $150, and that price is likely to drop even further during festive season sales. It&apos;s no doubt still a good phone, but is it really worth considering, now that the successor is here?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CvqPXMRFKhjf7ht7pHM3kW" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-display.jpg" alt="The display of the Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CvqPXMRFKhjf7ht7pHM3kW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In our opinion, not really. The newer model comes with a much more premium design, NFC, faster wired charging, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-dual-sim-android-phone" target="_blank">dual SIM</a> (and eSIM) support, and an extra year of OS and security updates, all for just a few dollars more. So, unless you really need those extra savings and don&apos;t care about contactless payments, fancy rear panels, and things like that, getting the Moto G 5G 2023 makes little to no sense.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is known for constantly changing its Android app's interface and is considering relocating the search bar to the bottom, a concept tested since 2021.</li><li>A new experiment involves a Material 3 redesign for the bottom bar, incorporating a pill-shaped search field.</li><li>The updated design introduces a default blue tint, replacing the Dynamic Color, to enhance visual appeal and modernize the app's appearance.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Android app loves to shake things up, especially with its interface, and it&apos;s back at it with the idea of putting the search bar at the bottom. This experiment has been kicking around for a while, starting way back in 2021 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-app-testing-bottom-search-bar">popping up again in late 2023</a>.</p><p>As spotted by a user on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/06/google-bottom-search-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>), there&apos;s a new test going on. Google is apparently playing around with a Material 3 redesign for the bottom bar, where it&apos;s putting a pill-shaped search field right into the bar itself.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Google UI pic.twitter.com/HGGVpw8ER9<a href="https://twitter.com/Cookie_lolll/status/1776355764338073656">April 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The big visual change is perhaps with the search bar. Currently, it&apos;s situated at the top of the app, but the redesign moves it down just above the bottom bar. This might seem like a small move, but it actually makes the bar way easier to reach, no matter what kind of phone you have.</p><p>This move might be Google&apos;s way of admitting our phones are getting huge. The search giant may be thinking that having a UX element up at the top might not be getting as many clicks as it likes. So, bringing the search down to the bottom could make it way easier to tap on and make your search experience a whole lot smoother.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:355px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="ivUi6gwBmyRkZmfZzjFwo5" name="Google-app-bottom-bar-redesign.jpg" alt="Google app's redesigned bottom bar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ivUi6gwBmyRkZmfZzjFwo5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="355" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Cookie_lolll / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the old version, the search bar shrank when you actually started searching. Now, it stays big and bold, no matter what you&apos;re looking for.</p><p>In the updated design, Google swaps out the <em>Dynamic Color</em> for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-plays-store-turns-blue">default blue tint</a>, which really pops against the Search results page. This redesign of the bottom search bar gives the Google app a much more modern vibe compared to how it looks right now.</p><p>One big change you&apos;ll notice is that in this redesign, the "Google" logo isn&apos;t up there at the top anymore. Instead, you&apos;ll see search filters like <em>Images</em>, <em>Videos</em>, <em>News</em>, and more right off the bat.</p><p>However, this shift means more space is taken up, which could have been used to show search results instead.</p><p>Sure, the new design might cut into how many search results you see at first, but hopefully it makes searching way easier and faster to use overall. We&apos;ll have to see if it works out when they roll it out to everyone.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio only started making over-ear headphones a year ago, but as is usually the case when the brand enters a new category, it rolled out a wave of new products. While the initial offerings catered to the mid-range segment, Fiio is now focusing on the entry-level segment with the introduction of the JT1.</p><p>I liked what Fiio did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a>, but it was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-reviewhttps://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a> that allowed the brand to distinguish itself in the mid-range segment. And while there is a decent amount of momentum in the category, it&apos;s the budget segment that sees a bulk of the activity — and sales.</p>
<p>That&apos;s why it&apos;s interesting to see that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-JT1-Professional-Headphones-Microphone/dp/B0CLZRWF8H">JT1 retail for just $57 on Amazon</a>. They&apos;re out of stock as of writing, but you can pick them up via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256805990654609.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt">Fiio&apos;s official store for $69</a>, or wait until they&apos;re available on Amazon once again. Like other entry-level Fiio products, the JT1 are branded under the Jade Audio label.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sSyucmNm2jGYxAxJWbgVDW" name="fiio-jt1-16.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sSyucmNm2jGYxAxJWbgVDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio says it focused on the sound quality instead of outward aesthetics, and that is evident. The JT1 don&apos;t really have a distinct design ethos, and they don&apos;t share any resemblances to the FT3 or FT5. That isn&apos;t a big issue considering just how affordable these headphones, and to its credit, Fiio continues to offer exquisite build quality on all of its products — the JT1 included.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RiaEa8jQHvgyD9Pj2dH58V" name="fiio-jt1-9.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RiaEa8jQHvgyD9Pj2dH58V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The earcups on the JT1 are made out of plastic, but the headband and the yokes connecting the earcups to the headband use aluminum, and it gives the headphones good structural rigidity. There isn&apos;t much in the way of swivel, and you miss out on the hard shell case that&apos;s bundled with the FT3 and FT5; you just get a basic carrying pouch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FZ2kydHTCyXUg3ZkgzLBVV" name="fiio-jt1-11.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZ2kydHTCyXUg3ZkgzLBVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the JT1 nails the basics. The headband uses a suspension design and distributes the weight of the headphones evenly across your head, and the leatherette material offers adequate cushioning. The best part is that the JT1 don&apos;t weigh as much; at just 301g, they&apos;re much more comfortable than either the FT3 or FT5.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cPeEhubQSPRpnBp6zWbomU" name="fiio-jt1-7.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cPeEhubQSPRpnBp6zWbomU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the design is a bit plain, it looks good in its own right, and the visible screws and aluminum exterior gives the JT1 an industrial look. The leatherette ear pads are large and very comfortable, and they can be easily switched out if you want to use aftermarket options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ytJ3msG857fp4GFhpz34EU" name="fiio-jt1-4.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ytJ3msG857fp4GFhpz34EU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who regularly uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a> and FT5, the lighter size of the JT1 made a big difference in daily use. The ear pads are just the right size, and they&apos;re incredibly soft and offer excellent comfort. I used a <em>lot </em>of budget headphones over the last two years, and the JT1 may just be the most comfortable yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K76cXhXxQ3GBYJt2s68XRU" name="fiio-jt1-5.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K76cXhXxQ3GBYJt2s68XRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are plenty of other tweaks to the JT1 that make the headphones stand out; they feature a detachable cable with 3.5mm plugs that connect to each earcup, and the cable that you get in the box is similar to that of the FT5. It has a 3.5mm plug, and you get a 3.5mm to 6.35mm connector in the box if you want to use it with a source that has a 6.35mm out. Interestingly, the cable has an inline mic and controls, but the quality of the mic isn&apos;t good. </p><p>The JT1 has a closed-back design, but there are vents on the outside of each earcup that does a good job relieving pressure, and the clamping force is light; if anything, I wanted the headphones to have a slightly tighter seal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i6vzbWFYsH4TMMJdq8iBhT" name="fiio-jt1-1.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i6vzbWFYsH4TMMJdq8iBhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a sensitivity of 103dB and impedance of just 32Ω, you can drive the JT1 with just about any source. I used the headphones with Fiio&apos;s KA5 dongle DAC and the M15S audio player, and you can use any budget dongle DAC to get the most out of the audio.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yzczSGMU664bBsFTRADPcU" name="fiio-jt1-6.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzczSGMU664bBsFTRADPcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that subject, the JT1 sound great — particularly when you consider what they cost. The low-end has plenty of vibrancy and is highly engaging, and mid-bass is exaggerated, delivering a satisfying rumble. The mid-range is clean and detailed, and vocals come through with a lot of clarity. The treble has good definition, but it doesn&apos;t have much in the way of extension, so you miss out on some detail.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ke4DberEoHoTEq3XsuhX5W" name="fiio-jt1-15.jpg" alt="Fiio JT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ke4DberEoHoTEq3XsuhX5W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The soundstage is wide given the JT1 feature 50mm closed-back dynamic drivers, and on the whole, the sound signature is clearly aimed at casual listening. It has a smooth quality to it that delivers good detail and clarity, and while you miss out on some nuance, it pairs well with a variety of genres.</p><p>Ultimately, the JT1 are a good choice if you want budget headphones with a comfortable fit and great sound quality. Fiio didn&apos;t go overboard with the features, instead focusing on areas that truly matter. As a result, the JT1 sound better than most other budget headphones I used.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio switched its focus to the desktop segment 18 months ago, and it led to a wave of products that unlocked new use cases while still retaining the brand&apos;s value-driven ethos. One product I was keen on looking at was the SP3, so when the audio manufacturer introduced the active speakers back in May 2023, I immediately had to take a look.</p><p>The SP3 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-SP3-Powered-Desktop-Speakers/dp/B0C69FXB9N">available for just $299 on Amazon</a>, and that makes it an enticing choice if you want powered speakers to use in a desktop setting. As is the case with most of its products, Fiio bundles a decent number of accessories in the box, including a 3.5mm to RCA cable, and two sets of rubber pads — a standard set and one with a 7-degree elevation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DPfviZDFAmAG566WGDXreP" name="fiio-sp3-12.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DPfviZDFAmAG566WGDXreP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unboxing the SP3, my initial thought was that the speakers look smaller than I imagined them to be. With a volume of just 2.35 liters, they don&apos;t take up much room at all, and if you have limited space on your desk, the SP3 may just be a great choice. I paired the active speakers with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-r7-review">outstanding R7 all-in-one streamer</a>, and it&apos;s clear that these two products were designed together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9KxoBviq6WHcNyuyszt8GP" name="fiio-sp3-11.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9KxoBviq6WHcNyuyszt8GP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The SP3 cabinet is machined out of metal, and it has outstanding build quality; while the size is on the smaller size, each speaker unit is considerably heavy, with a total weight of 7.4lb (3.4kg). The SP3 has a grooved design that looks good, and it looks much more upmarket than its price tag would suggest.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TsHSekAzMG4Xo3ycLaeeJN" name="fiio-sp3-6.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TsHSekAzMG4Xo3ycLaeeJN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the fact that there&apos;s RGB lighting at the bottom means the SP3 ticks all the right boxes in my book; the lighting is subtle and doesn&apos;t distract from the design, but I like it just the same. I used the SP3 with the elevated rubber pads, and that gave the unit slightly better presence.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KWTr83Xpkrg7QKDFhyGMKM" name="fiio-sp3-1.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KWTr83Xpkrg7QKDFhyGMKM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, if you like the look of the SP3 and are considering buying the speakers, I&apos;d suggest getting the white model. Fiio sent the regular black version of the SP3 and R7 for review, and while they both look good, they definitely do not stand out anywhere as much as the white models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fxEJG5xK6zJtsAnvLL3HxP" name="fiio-sp3-18.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fxEJG5xK6zJtsAnvLL3HxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The right side of the SP3 houses all the controls and connectors, with the left acting as just a speaker. While Fiio usually does a great job with connectivity, the SP3 doesn&apos;t get all that much in terms of ports: you get a 3.5mm in and line in, and that&apos;s about it. There&apos;s no optical connectivity, and the speaker misses out on Bluetooth connectivity. There&apos;s no remote either, so you&apos;ll need to use the volume and bass dials at the back of the unit to change volume and adjust bass.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XJss73TMiyzRYAqrE65jBQ" name="fiio-sp3-15.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XJss73TMiyzRYAqrE65jBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another omission is the lack of a subwoofer out. While the SP3 produces great sound in its own right, it&apos;s clear that the ability to connect to a subwoofer would have made the speakers that much more inviting. As it stands, the speakers produce 80W of power in total: there are two 3.5-inch subwoofer units that put out 30W each, and there&apos;s a 1-inch silk dome tweeter on each unit that goes up to 10W.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2TF2RCLZVLRm5cxvAvZpkQ" name="fiio-sp3-17.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2TF2RCLZVLRm5cxvAvZpkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio says it is using a double-diffused porting tube to maximize the sound potential of the SP3, and that is indeed the case. I was pleasantly astonished by the sound coming out of the SP3, and while the speaker has a diminutive stature, it is able to produce room-filling sound with relative ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AdXbWRgCdoNJfqqQy8hfdN" name="fiio-sp3-8.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AdXbWRgCdoNJfqqQy8hfdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of that is the use of the 3.5-inch subwoofer; Fiio says it went with a carbon composite material to save weight while offering a rigid structure, and combined with the 1-inch dome tweeter, you get a detailed sound with no distortion even at high volume.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nSAVoTxHxg4CczvBoreGwN" name="fiio-sp3-9.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nSAVoTxHxg4CczvBoreGwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the bass is limited because of the inherent size of the speakers, but you get a clean articulation, and some vibrancy. Of course, having a dedicated subwoofer would have made all the difference, but in its own right, the SP3 is decent enough considering its size.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z2QrUk7DgPAFJ3prPe8PVP" name="fiio-sp3-13.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2QrUk7DgPAFJ3prPe8PVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mid-range is where the SP3 comes into its own, delivering a clean sound with plenty of clarity and definition. You get full-bodied vocals that sound terrific, and they definitely punch above their segment in this area. The treble is energetic and airy, and you get a balanced sound without any harshness whatsoever — Fiio nailed the tuning in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gh3ZmLgu3znw4RAyMg84aQ" name="fiio-sp3-19.jpg" alt="Fiio SP3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gh3ZmLgu3znw4RAyMg84aQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, there are a lot of great choices if you&apos;re looking to get powered speakers in this category, and most products have Bluetooth connectivity and digital ports as standard. While the Fiio is in the backfoot when it comes to connectivity, the sound quality ultimately redeems the SP3; you just don&apos;t get such a refined sound in this segment.</p><p>So if you want a pair of powered speakers that don&apos;t take up too much room and deliver a powerful sound that belies their size, the SP3 may just be the ideal choice for your use case.</p>

<p>Gmail on Android might soon pick up a smart upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">give you the lowdown on long emails using AI</a>, saving you time digging for the important bits.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/05/gmail-summarize-this-email-android/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>, in collaboration with AssembleDebug, uncovered a <em>Summarize this email</em> button in the Gmail app for Android. Clues pointing to this feature were hidden in version 2024.03.31.621006929 of the app.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gmail app readying 'Summarize this email' feature powered by Gemini AI on AndroidRead - https://t.co/clWBLuQs1p#Gmail #Android pic.twitter.com/TVtylD37ZH<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1776197309560463477">April 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Take a look at the screenshot below, where you can see the button, although it&apos;s not yet active.</p>

<p>This summarize button makes sense for long emails. It&apos;s powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and is already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-bard-can-now-summarize-multiple-emails-at-once-for-you">present in the web version of Gmail</a>, which is accessible to users of the Gemini for Workspace suite. So, it&apos;s not a huge surprise that it&apos;s making its way to the Android app.</p><p>But according to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14199860?hl=en#zippy=%2Csummarize-an-email-thread" target="_blank">support page</a>, this feature is only applicable to email threads with more than two replies. Additionally, it&apos;s clear that the Workspace feature is primarily intended for enterprise use.</p><p>On the other hand, this new button on the mobile app seems like it might be for everyone. As shown in the screenshot above, the button pops up just under the subject line. However, since this feature is still in its infancy, tapping this button doesn&apos;t currently trigger any action.</p><p>Nevertheless, it&apos;s likely that the experience will mirror the same feature found in the web version of Gmail, where users with access to Gemini for Workspace can click on the <em>Ask Gemini</em> button within an email thread. This opens up a sidebar offering suggestions for the next action.</p><p>Besides the <em>Summarize this email</em> button, AssembleDebug has found a separate option specifically for Gemini within the three-dot menu inside email threads. However, tapping this button currently leads to an empty panel with no content.</p><p>Gemini has already showcased its versatility and is continuously growing, especially within other Google services, notably Workspace apps. We&apos;ve recently caught wind of Gemini&apos;s influence in Gmail for Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-gemini-to-help-you-respond-to-emails-in-gmail-for-android">with its reply suggestions feature</a>. It&apos;s just a waiting game before intelligent summaries also become a part of the service.</p>

<ul><li>Canada's planned $2.4 billion investment in AI will focus on bolstering computing power for AI research, startups, and scaleups.</li><li>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized the potential of this investment to drive job creation and boost research and business productivity in the AI sector.</li><li>A significant portion of the investment, around CA$2 billion, will be dedicated to enhancing compute capabilities and infrastructure.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Canada&apos;s Liberal government has revealed a $2.4 billion package aimed at boosting the country&apos;s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-government-ai-investment-1.7166234" target="_blank">CBC</a>, Canada&apos;s government intends to use its 2024 budget to funnel the money into ramping up computing power for the nation&apos;s AI researchers, startups, and scaleups.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that this investment will tap into AI&apos;s full potential by speeding up job creation in Canada&apos;s AI sector, as well as enhancing research and business productivity through its adoption.</p><p>The bulk of the investment (CA$2 billion) will go towards boosting compute capabilities and infrastructure. This support will benefit Canada&apos;s leading AI researchers and startups, leading to the establishment of the Canadian AI Sovereign Compute Strategy.</p><p>Currently, Canada relies heavily on privately owned computing systems, likely referring to cloud services offered by companies based outside the country. This raises security concerns, as the data stored on these systems could be vulnerable to foreign access.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland suggested at a Sunday press conference that the fund would allow Canada to store and process data within its own borders, potentially improving national security, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/federal-government-announces-2-billion-investment-to-support-ai-research-growth/article_eeb133b8-f4e8-11ee-a557-ab828d4f2cf1.html" target="_blank">Toronto Star</a>.</p><p>Freeland believes Canada has the resources to build its own supercomputing infrastructure. This includes access to clean electricity for powering the systems, skilled engineers to design and maintain them, a cold climate that can help with cooling, and ample space to house large facilities.</p><p>Additionally, CA$200 million will be distributed by Canada&apos;s Regional Development Agencies to incentivize AI startups and enhance AI integration across pivotal sectors like agriculture, healthcare, clean technology, and manufacturing.</p><p>Generative AI models, propelled by pioneers such as OpenAI with its ChatGPT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google&apos;s Gemini</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/un-global-ai-resolution">are rapidly advancing</a>. Canada appears eager to foster its own contender in this field.</p><p>The Canadian government is also establishing a $50 million AI safety institute. This institute will likely research and develop safeguards to mitigate risks posed by "advanced or nefarious AI systems."</p><p>An additional $5.1 million will be directed towards an office of the AI and Data Commissioner, whose role would likely be to enforce the proposed Artificial Intelligence and Data Act. This act would set guidelines and regulations around the development, use, and oversight of AI in Canada.</p>

The black Bespoke Edition of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Sapphire-Titanium/dp/B0BVGS4FM2"><strong>selling at Amazon with an outstanding 38% discount</strong></a>, offering buyers a powerful smartwatch with excellent battery life at just $278. Similarly, the black ridge band version of the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is 37% off at a sale price of $281.99. The exact Amazon discount keeps fluctuating for the watch, so don&apos;t wait too long if this price sounds good to you.  </p><p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro was rated the "best premium pick" on our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-premium-pick">best Android watches</a>, and there&apos;s more than one reason why. The battery life, for instance, can last up to 80 hours if you aren&apos;t using power-draining features like the always-on display (AOD) or the constantly-listening Google Assistant. Even with these on, the Watch 5 Pro performs pretty well, and it comes with impressively fast 10W charging, along with several other features that users love.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> is an excellent pick as far as smartwatches go, and at over $170 off the purchase price, this is a certifiably good deal. Get up to three days of battery life, super-quick 10W charging, and a number of userful fitness and health sensors. Even though this isn't Samsung's latest Galaxy Watch generation, it still holds up to the hype of the newer models, especially since it's been updated with the user-friendly Wear OS 4.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch5-pro-titanium-smartwatch-45mm-bt-black/6510873.p">Best Buy - $449.99</a><strong> |</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch5-Pro-45mm-Smart-Watch-Bluetooth-Black-Titanium/1401202059">Walmart - $449.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVGS4FM2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fe439bc2-6d0c-4bc1-aaf5-31904868cd1a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$449.99" data-dimension48="$449.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a watch that has superior battery life; you liked the Wear OS software on other Samsung Galaxy Watch generations; you&apos;re looking for a sleek, black smartwatch that&apos;s durable enough to take with you on outdoor excursions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a slightly less wide band and think you might like the 40mm better than the 45mm band; you&apos;re hoping to save even more money on a less premium smartwatch; you want something small and easy to sleep with.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro holds up well to the newer generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, still offering even better battery life and plenty of health monitoring tools for the average user. Without using active battery-draining features, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro can get access to as many as 80 hours of battery life per charge, while charging up super quickly with the 10W charging.</p><p>Like any watch, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro does come with a few caveats that could be deal-breakers for some. As one example, some found it too thick and heavy to sleep with, despite including easy-to-use sleep monitoring tools. It&apos;s also pretty pricey when compared with the non-Pro option, though this deal makes it a little more doable.</p>

Fitness watches with weeks-long battery life have the easiest method: use a wimpy, efficient CPU that sticks to health data and notifications. The other two solutions for longer smartwatch battery life come with drawbacks and compromises, and I&apos;m not sure that&apos;ll ever change.</p><p>Smartwatch makers know we&apos;re sick of recharging our watches daily. They&apos;ve sped up charging times in recent years so you can top them off quickly before or after bed, making it easier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">sleep with a watch</a>. For many, that stopgap measure isn&apos;t enough, and they switch to "dumber" watches from Garmin or Fitbit to avoid the hassle.</p><p>Apple doesn&apos;t make its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Series watches</a> last 18 hours year after year for kicks. It can&apos;t take a year off from adding new, battery-guzzling features or sensors without consumer apathy and stockholder panic. Nor can it add extra battery capacity without ruining the design.</p><p>Wear OS watches have done better, to an extent. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>&apos;s 40-hour battery is certainly an improvement — even if it&apos;s a 10-hour drop-off from last year — and the 24-hour <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> does, at least, make it easier to pick a consistent time to charge it. </p><p>The problems arise whenever you try to last any longer than that.</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve followed my weekly column, you know I prefer fitness watches to traditional smartwatches, mainly for running metrics and battery life. I <em>do</em> miss the option of proper wrist apps, though. That&apos;s why two of my favorite smartwatches of the last two years are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.</p><p>The Watch 5 Pro and Ultra 2 hit 80 and 36 hours, respectively, well beyond the norm for smartwatches. Equally important for my purposes, they&apos;re supposed to last 20 or 12 hours while tracking your GPS location for workouts — in the same ballpark as a Garmin watch. We&apos;ve also heard that Samsung will bring back the Galaxy Watch 7 Pro with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-could-get-better-battery-life">slightly larger battery</a>.</p><p>Aside from costing an arm and a leg, what&apos;s the downside to these watches? Once you factor in the watch band, both smartwatch flagships weigh about 2.5–3oz, more than double the weight of your typical fitness tracker. </p><p>Regular smartwatches keep steadily gaining weight, even if it&apos;s usually only a gram per year, like the Galaxy Watch 4 (26g) versus the Watch 6 (29g). They keep squeezing in more components and battery capacity, like subtle weight training for our wrists. But to double your battery life, you also have to double the weight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2zVpAWvUpd4KgGEDwVe5b5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Pro-side-view-2.jpeg" alt="Side view of the thick Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and its two side buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2zVpAWvUpd4KgGEDwVe5b5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tech brands know that their target audience — eager tech fans who read sites like ours and always need the latest flagship model, plus credulous journalists getting $800 watches for free — will accept wearing a giant chunk of metal on their wrists for extra battery life. When people complain that their mainline watches die quickly, Apple and Samsung can point to their well-reviewed premium watches and call you a "power user" who should spend more.</p><p>Again, I love that these watches finally "solved" smartwatches&apos; core flaw for me. But some people can&apos;t afford that solution, and others don&apos;t have enough wrists to <em>wear</em> the solution. And so long as these high-end models exist, smartwatch brands have little incentive to make the cheaper models more efficient. Packing in flashy new features is the higher priority.</p>
<h2 id="the-oneplus-watch-2-solves-this-problem-with-tradeoffs-2">The OnePlus Watch 2 solves this problem... with tradeoffs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AVMDMJm5Ay4HcPjqHLTtFd" name="oneplus-watch-2-27.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 Play Store icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVMDMJm5Ay4HcPjqHLTtFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> blew us away when it first launched, consistently lasting four days per charge. The more we used it, however, the more we realized that the longer battery life came with serious tradeoffs.</p><p>OnePlus credited its longevity to a dual-processor design: the 4nm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> chip handles the heavy-duty app tasks, while its 12nm BES2700 co-processor handles "background tasks" like notifications and health data via the lightweight RTOS. Google and OnePlus worked together to make this system work, calling it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a>.</p><p>It sounds great in theory, but in practice, two AC reviewers found that it undercounts steps by thousands across a busy day, claims you&apos;re standing when you&apos;re sitting, overreports stress on calm days, and can&apos;t properly track higher anaerobic heart rates during workouts. It also failed to deliver notifications, sometimes.</p><p>These issues stem directly from OnePlus&apos; hybrid OS system. Its co-processor struggles to sample your health data quickly enough, either by design to save battery life or due to its clock limitations. Either way, it undercuts one of the main reasons to wear a smartwatch.</p><p>OnePlus also saves battery life by using Google&apos;s special XML Watch Face Format, which saves battery life. The only problem is that our reviewer found the watch faces boring, and when he tried installing a custom one with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-facer-on-pixel-watch">Facer</a>, it cut his watch&apos;s battery life from four days to <em>one</em>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 watch face highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is relatively new to the smartwatch game, and other brands like Google or Apple might handle hybrid systems better. Relegating background tasks to a more efficient chip is probably the only way that smartwatches <em>could</em> last longer.</p><p>I simply can&apos;t take it for granted that the compromises of a hybrid system won&apos;t outweigh the benefits. Most smartwatches already have a power-saving mode, and a hybrid mode feels like a rebranding of that same principle: disabling battery-guzzling features and slowing the sampling rate for your heart rate or location. And I don&apos;t see much point in wearing a heavy smartwatch if you&apos;re not going to use its smarts.</p><p>If smartwatches of the future can track dozens of health metrics in the background using a low-powered chip while extending battery life, that&apos;d be fantastic! But I&apos;m skeptical that tech brands can pull it off without making your data too inconsistent to be reliable; let&apos;s hope I&apos;m proven wrong.</p>
<h2 id="smartwatch-ai-probably-won-apos-t-change-anything-2">Smartwatch AI probably won&apos;t change anything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VhXBcww8bmF56Zt8FEkJxf" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-vitality-score.jpeg" alt="My Vitality score reveal showing new Samsung Health feature launching later this year." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VhXBcww8bmF56Zt8FEkJxf.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the year of AI, at least on smartphones. What this means for smartwatches and their battery life isn&apos;t certain yet.</p>
<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> essentially replacing Google Assistant on Android phones, it feels like only a matter of time until these same brands try to get Gemini and other AI features on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>. Of course, most AI versions today rely on cloud-based computing, and pulling data from wi-fi drains a watch&apos;s battery pretty quickly.</p><p>Other AI features will work in the back end. We know that Samsung plans to introduce a "Vitality Score" this summer for the Galaxy Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, based on your sleep and health data. And if I&apos;m going to rely on this data, I&apos;d rather my watch get the most accurate data possible, not check in at random intervals to save battery.</p><p>Ultimately, my guess is that smartwatch chips will start becoming more and more like phone chips, with multiple cores and processors and AI-focused NPUs all chugging along on your wrist, adding more and more features over time. We&apos;ll see what kind of impact that has on smartwatch battery life, but I think breaking even is about all we can hope for.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio releases a lot of gear over the course of the year, and when the brand announced that it was coming out with the Q15, I thought it would be a higher-end model of the Q7. But the Bluetooth DAC costs half as much as the Q7, while retaining a similar design — albeit in a smaller size — and a lot of similar features.</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it&apos;s because Fiio has made a habit out of doing this. The K9 DAC also goes the same route, offering the same design and a ton of the same features as the flagship K9 Pro, but for a lot less. Clearly, Fiio is looking to flesh out its DAC portfolio and list products in all price segments, and in that context, the Q15 makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2ReuhYf2Qnf3EMSVCZF6KQ" name="fiio-q15-2.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ReuhYf2Qnf3EMSVCZF6KQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Headphone-Amplifier-Bluetooth-LDAC%EF%BC%8C1600mW/dp/B0CMWBZK8J">retailing at $399 on Amazon</a>, and that is less than half of what the Q7 costs. When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-q7-review">reviewed the Q7</a>, I called it an endgame DAC that had everything you could want in a portable DAC. Fiio hasn&apos;t changed too many things with the Q15; in fact, the biggest omission is the lack of a 6.35mm port — the DAC just isn&apos;t big enough to accommodate the jack. Otherwise, the Q15 is able to deliver 1.6W of power, uses AKM hardware, and has all the AptX codecs you need.</p>

<p>Other than that, it retains a similar design as the Q7, and you get a bold aesthetic with jagged edges that looks striking. What&apos;s great is that you now get a titanium color option, so if you don&apos;t like the look of the standard black model, the titanium variant looks much more pleasing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JFSB78P785KnGNo7Yia9PT" name="fiio-q15-20.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JFSB78P785KnGNo7Yia9PT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 305g, the Q15 is less than half the weight of the Q7, and that makes it a great choice if you need a portable DAC. The biggest design difference is at the back, where Fiio switched out the leather back of the Q7 with a frosted glass back that feels great to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rwnJXEakLEbg7aayxsKdUQ" name="fiio-q15-3.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwnJXEakLEbg7aayxsKdUQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The front has a glossy insert that takes up a considerable amount of the real estate, and the 1.3-inch TFT panel is housed within the island. Fiio is reusing the same panel as the Q7, and it has the same size and resolution of 240 x 240. The panel lets you change modes — you get USB, coaxial, and Bluetooth — and you can access the settings with a long press of the volume knob, giving you access to gain, max volume, filters, and EQ. You get the same Hi-Res labels as the Q7, but there&apos;s no THX branding.</p>

<p>The menu interface is basic, but it gives you easy access to all the features of the DAC without having to pull up Fiio&apos;s Control mobile app. This is a small tweak, but I like that the settings menu now has a back button that lets you go back to the source page.</p>

<p>Fiio includes a carrying pouch with the Q15, but I would have liked to see a case similar to that of the Q7. But given the positioning of the Q15, you don&apos;t get one in the box. Other than the case, you get two USB-C to USB-C cables, a USB-A dongle, and two silicone bands that let you attach the Q15 to a phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jcNvte36Z6KuSgcBqMdTAR" name="fiio-q15-8.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jcNvte36Z6KuSgcBqMdTAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The build quality of the Q15 is phenomenal; the DAC has an all-metal chassis that uses aluminum, and in the three months I had the unit, I didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. I like the texture volume knob too, as it makes changing the volume easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3PTN7NNqNKrT2csiqV87cQ" name="fiio-q15-4.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3PTN7NNqNKrT2csiqV87cQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 has a 3.5mm single-ended port and a balanced 4.4mm port that are located on either side of the large volume knob, and as is usually the case with most Fiio products, there&apos;s an LED ring that encircles the volume knob. The Q7 gets 2.5mm and 6.35mm connectors as well, but considering the use case of the Q15, a single-ended and balanced connector are more than adequate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YPwUkyiTcr9xvnhXxxHjsQ" name="fiio-q15-5.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPwUkyiTcr9xvnhXxxHjsQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to the Q7, you get control buttons on the Q15, but they&apos;re now located on the left; there&apos;s a power button, and three buttons to control music playback. At the bottom is where you see the various ports; the Q15 has coaxial and USB connectors, and there&apos;s a second USB-C port that can be used to charge the DAC. By contrast, the Q7 has a single USB-C port to connect and charge the DAC, and it has an optical port in addition to coaxial.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YBxVGSiwbh8sVWmPEv4UbR" name="fiio-q15-11.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YBxVGSiwbh8sVWmPEv4UbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what&apos;s great is that you can switch between modes easily via toggles located at the bottom. You can use the Q15 in desktop mode, and it doesn&apos;t use the built-in battery in this mode. There&apos;s a phone mode as well, and in this mode, the Q15 uses its built-in battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9SvCe82P5nZ9HNsqmKEabS" name="fiio-q15-22.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SvCe82P5nZ9HNsqmKEabS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that subject, the Q15 has a 5500mAh battery that delivers just over nine hours of music playback over the balanced 4.4mm port, and eight hours on the 3.5mm jack. It takes over three and a half hours to charge the DAC, so it isn&apos;t something you&apos;ll want to do during the day. It goes up to 15W when using a USB PD charger, and I left the unit charging overnight most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3vJgVPs3r8SwXdxVo3ZjtS" name="fiio-q15-21.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vJgVPs3r8SwXdxVo3ZjtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that the Q7 has one of the best sound signatures of any portable DAC, the Q15 has a lot to offer in this area, and it is off to a promising start. The DAC uses a combination of AKM&apos;s AK4191EQ and AK4499EX, and they&apos;re joined by the Qualcomm QCC5125, which oversees the Bluetooth side of things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kpDsVGhRV3NQPnxCAKqVAS" name="fiio-q15-14.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpDsVGhRV3NQPnxCAKqVAS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 includes all the AptX codecs — AptX, AptX HD, AptX LL, and AptX Adaptive — in addition to LDAC, and in USB mode, it is able to go up to 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and DSD512. If you use the coaxial connector, it goes up to 192kHz/24-bit and DSD64.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BR76E9unCSjpSFDLdMBeJS" name="fiio-q15-16.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BR76E9unCSjpSFDLdMBeJS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s the power on offer that makes the Q15 such a great choice; the DAC is able to deliver 1600mW of power, and that allows it to drive any IEM and headset in the market today. I used it with the Audeze LCD-GX, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, and about a dozen IEMs over the course of the last three months, and didn&apos;t run into any issues.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity makes the Q15 about as easy to use as possible with a phone, and with most Android devices offering LDAC natively — Google baked it into Android several years ago — you will get 96kHz/32-bit playback over Bluetooth without any hassle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sit6RZBrH4quMKrHY7W7mS" name="fiio-q15-19.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sit6RZBrH4quMKrHY7W7mS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the Q15 doesn&apos;t have any audible hiss, so even sensitive IEMs are a good pairing with the DAC. Like other Fiio DACs, the Q15 has a neutral sound that doesn&apos;t add any coloration. That said, going with AKM over the usual ESS Sabre models means you get a slightly different sound profile, with increased vibrancy in the low-end.</p><p>The bass is wonderfully detailed and textured when using the FT5, and there is a slight exuberance in the sub-bass region that makes using the Q15 that much more enjoyable. The mids are natural and have plenty of character, and the treble has good extension. The imaging and dynamics are excellent, and the Q15 is the latest in a long list of Fiio DACs that absolutely nails the technical details.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="89nrdcJKstKmAegLhqth4T" name="fiio-q15-23.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/89nrdcJKstKmAegLhqth4T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like the K9, the Q15 is a value leader. Yes, the Q7 has better tonality and does a better job driving endgame headsets, but if you just need a Bluetooth DAC to use with IEMs and most headsets under $1,000, it does an incredible job. The feature-set is nearly identical to what you&apos;re getting on the Q7, and the affordability makes the Q15 a no-brainer.</p>

<p>When a total solar eclipse happens, the moon slides right between Earth and the sun. This means the moon will completely block the sun for a few minutes, turning daytime into twilight (how long depends on your viewing spot).</p><p>This eclipse is set to be a blockbuster, with tens of millions of people residing along the path of totality. This path stretches across Northern America, spanning 115 miles wide, where the moon will pull off the ultimate cover-up, blocking out 100% of the sun&apos;s disk.</p><p>If you&apos;re lucky enough to be there, you won&apos;t want to miss it. And while at that, there are a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-the-eclipse-through-your-smartphone-with-these-cheap-solar-glasses">few cheap solar glasses with which you can watch the eclipse</a>.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/the-sun/2024-solar-eclipse-map-where-to-see-the-eclipse-on-april-8" target="_blank">Live Science</a>, this cosmic journey kicks off in Sinaloa, Mexico, and then heads northeast, trekking through Texas before cruising through 15 states. Finally, it bids farewell to the U.S. as it heads north into Canada.</p><p>The states along the way where you&apos;ll catch totality are: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p><p>That said, Tennessee and Michigan will only get a quick peek at the moon&apos;s shadow passing by.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/visitation" target="_blank">Great American Eclipse website</a>, around 1 to 4 million Americans are expected to travel for this stellar event. If you&apos;re not in that specific stretch or prefer to enjoy the action from your couch, don&apos;t fret. NASA and other groups are set to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/watch-total-solar-eclipse-april-8-online-free-livestreams" target="_blank">livestream the whole event</a>, so you can catch the eclipsed sun from anywhere online.</p>
