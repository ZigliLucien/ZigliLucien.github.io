I was immediately taken aback by the sound quality on my first listen because, more often than not, open ear products fall flat when it comes to dynamic audio reproduction, especially on the bass end of the frequency spectrum. </p><p>Using a bit of 90’s hip hop parlance, Nothing Ear (Open)’s got me open, so let’s take a detailed look at what makes it our new Editor’s Choice for open ear options!</p>

<p>The Nothing Ear (Open) launched on September 24 and are available in the US, Canada, and the UK from October 1 and Europe from October 7. There’s only one colorway, which will cost you $149 USD / $199 CAD / £129 GBP / €149 EUR, with availability through Nothing.tech and from retailers like Amazon.com.</p>

<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">testing quite a few open-ear earbuds</a>, I&apos;ll begin by making a case for why this is the Editor’s Choice by starting... with the case. While not the smallest earbud case on the market, it is one of the smaller cases when you look at offerings from the open-ear competition. Nothing again places its signature colored dots on the inside to make putting the earpieces in their cradles a cinch. The lid is clear with a metal hinge and another metal embellishment where the case opens. </p><p>Sitting inside, the buds and the entire package look almost like a jeweler’s display. Though thin and easily pocketable, the case is tall. Although it will fit in your pocket, depending on how tall you and your pockets are, it also might be sticking up and out of your pocket.</p>

<p>Being open-ear earbuds, they don’t sit inside your ear canal, and I’ve worn them for hours at a time to test their comfort. The result was no fatigue, to the point that you’d almost forget that you’re wearing earbuds. The soft-touch silicone material the ear hooks are made of, along with the position of the battery and angling of the transducer, combine like Voltron to form a giant robot that protects your wearing comfort. It&apos;s good that battery life holds up to my extended periods of wear and meets Nothing&apos;s claim of eight hours on a charge. You may get a little more juice if your listening volume is low the majority of your time wearing them.</p><p>Let’s get to what you came here for, though! Sound quality. I listened to various genres of music at low volumes and higher volumes. I listened in quiet rooms and on noisy urban streets. I listened to movies and anime. Nothing Ear (Open) are the closest I’ve come to experiencing an open design that sounds like traditional earbuds that sit in your ear canal. For the first time in an open-ear review, I can say that bass lovers will thoroughly enjoy this experience, but that is not to the exclusion of those who love acoustic music. The musicality and stereo imaging are just as enjoyable.</p><p>The haunting, ethereal vocals are beautifully reproduced when listening to “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” OST. The soundstage is diminished at low volumes, but turning the volume up increases that soundstage, adding the ethereal back to the experience.</p><p>Jazz is jumpin’ like your favorite juke joint! Ok, so you may not have a favorite “juke joint” in this day and age (Google it), but you have clarity, discreet instrumentation, warm upright bass reproduction, beautiful horn sections, and, ultimately, immersion.</p><p>Sylosis&apos;s “Poison for the Lost” is a counterpoint to The Roots “Do You Want More????” The former is a death metal track heavy on guitar and with guttural vocals. The latter is a bass-heavy hip-hop track with some high-frequency instrumentation, thanks to the addition of bagpipes in the mix. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oTjqR5UTgWBUdD7o7jiGLY" name="nothing-ear-open-bud-x-app-advanced-eq.JPG" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTjqR5UTgWBUdD7o7jiGLY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For low-volume listening, you’re likely going to want two different EQ settings, and that’s another area where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">many of Nothing’s audio offerings shine</a>. With the Ear (open), you get Nothing’s full slate of EQ offerings between their simple and advanced EQ settings. </p><p>The simple settings, complete with the ability to customize what is essentially a 3-band EQ, will be enough for most listeners, especially considering these are open earbuds. But if you feel like it makes a difference, you can hit Nothing’s proper parametric EQ in the advanced tab and play with gain, bandwidth, and Q-factor to your heart’s content. I’d recommend playing with the simple settings at the very least because it will make a difference in sound quality at low volumes when listening to podcasts or anything vocal-focused.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the Ear (open) that I appreciate is the ChatGPT integration. The first earbuds to do so. It’s great, and it’s incredibly useful when researching things on the go or talking through a plan or idea, but it’s not perfect. A brief example of the good, the bad, and the ugly is this:</p><p>To test it out, I queried ChatGPT about the best fancy restaurants in Malibu, California, to eat at. This beautiful city is on the famous Pacific Coast Highway that runs along the Southern California coastline. ChatGPT gave me brilliant advice, along with context on why, for a few different restaurants, but that’s where the utility ends. I couldn’t ask it to call the restaurants for me or to give me driving directions tied into Google Maps and then take me there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yk9aP6Df6zHu28Cc5p7ugV" name="nothing-ear-open-case-red-dot.JPG" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yk9aP6Df6zHu28Cc5p7ugV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A little feature that some folk may not consider rounds out the list of things I like. The case, like the buds themselves, is IP54-rated for dust and water ingress. Since these are meant for use cases where people may be outside during inclement weather, that’s a reassuring feature. However, this rating means that you can’t wear them during heavy rains, so in the next iteration, I’d like to see an IP65 rating, which would allow these to be worn during more challenging climate conditions.</p>

<p>One last note on the things I like: call quality is <em><strong>very good. </strong></em>I recorded microphone audio when I had them connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> and asked callers how I sounded during calls. In both instances, audio quality was Nothing to sneeze at.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-open-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Nothing Ear (Open): What could use improvement</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kGXV6MmznttPyXUpR9SZCa" name="nothing-ear-open-earbud-cu.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kGXV6MmznttPyXUpR9SZCa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn’t a lot to dislike here! At all. A couple of standout items would be the lack of wireless charging for the case and the case length. Both issues are pretty standard in the open-ear market segment, though.</p><p>With that said, while there isn’t much I dislike, there are two things I’d like to see in a second-generation version of these fantastic earbuds: wireless charging for the case and Hi-Res Wireless audio support. Not necessarily to make the music “better,” but since they <em>are</em> open-ear, having every bit of dynamic range I can get so that I can get every ounce of audio data and frequency out of these earbuds as possible would be great!</p><p>I’d also like to see Google Assistant integration. Once I research restaurants while I’m out with my beautiful wife and we decide on one, I need to hand it off to Google Assistant for whatever next steps: creating a note, driving directions, setting a reminder, you get the idea.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YGm6jxQfS5m9NK4ew9sQPX" name="nothing-ear-open-bluetooth-settings.JPG" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGm6jxQfS5m9NK4ew9sQPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last, though the ChatGPT integration is awesome, I need that functionality to do more. For example, I’d like the ability to configure each earbud independently to use whatever digital assistant you want. Currently, you can only set Google Assistant or ChatGPT as your assistant. Once you set the pinch command on either earbud, that setting is ubiquitous across both earbuds, despite the fact that you can customize the other functions independently for either earbud.</p><p>And I’m being nitpicky here, but I’d like them in a color other than white so that they won’t look grimy as quickly as these may. Time will tell, but with white buds and a white case, this is a concern of mine.</p>

<p>There are a few others in this market segment, but they have a lot to live up to because, at $150, Nothing makes an excellent value proposition with its quality and feature set. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open</a> and BeyerDynamic Verio 200 both compete on sound quality and features, but they are at a premium. The former costs twice as much, $300, while the latter is $70 more at $220.</p><p>You can get close to the Nothing Ear (open) in price with Shokz OpenFit and 1More Fit products, but I think the Ear (Open) has them beat in sound quality and options. </p>

<p>Sometimes, in life, it feels like Nothing is simple. That won’t be the case here! The Nothing Ear (Open) compete with products that cost much more and sound just as good. </p><p>The earbuds sound great and are feature-rich, including the ability to converse with an AI assistant if you also have a Nothing phone. These alone make the Ear (Open) very easy to recommend for those hunting for a solid pair of open earbuds.</p>

<hr>
<p>Redmi has confirmed the Redmi Note 14 Pro series will launch on September 26 in China, with both models in the lineup promising flagship-level screen toughness and durability.</p><p>The Xiaomi sub-brand announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3021514657/OyhXZuXQx" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the Redmi Note 14 Pro and Pro Plus will come with Gorilla Glass Victus 2, a solid upgrade over the Victus glass on last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_14_pro_series_launch_date_officially_announced-news-64648.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is crafted to endure drops from heights of up to one meter on concrete. Additionally, it matches the original Victus by surviving falls from as high as two meters onto asphalt.</p><p>As an extra perk, customers will get a complimentary screen replacement if their device suffers any damage within the first twelve months.</p><p>On top of that, the Redmi Note 14 Pro series is said to have aced the IP69 waterproofing test. This rating shows that the device can endure high-pressure hot water jets, going beyond the immersion capabilities defined by the IP68 standard.</p><p>In contrast, the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus had an IP68 rating, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-long-term-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro</a> came with an IP54 rating.</p><p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro series will join a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phones</a> with an IP69 rating, such as the upcoming OPPO F27 Pro and the recently released Pro Plus model, which also boasts Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><p>Official renders shared by Xiaomi reveal the Redmi Note 14 Pro in Mirror Porcelain White, Phantom Blue, and Twilight Purple. The device boasts a curved display with a hole-punch cutout, along with an elliptical camera island that houses three lenses and an LED flash.</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1838090984560988531" target="_blank">suggest</a> that the Redmi Note 14 Pro models will sport a 1.5K OLED display and a triple camera setup, headlined by a 50MP primary sensor. Additionally, the Note 14 Pro is expected to pack a 5,500mAh battery with support for fast 67W charging.</p><p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro is tipped to draw its power from a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, while the Pro Plus may be equipped with a Dimensity 7350 SoC.</p><p>The Chinese phone maker often rolls out global versions of the Redmi Note series a few months after the initial launch in its home turf. Therefore, don’t expect these phones to become available in your region right after their debut this week.</p>

<p><em><strong>Romit asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Hi Jerry,</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I have a question related to recycling old phones where I live. This place does not have a e-waste recycling system as far as I know. Could you maybe suggest how I can get rid of my old phones?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Romit! I love this question because I think the most important thing we should talk about when dealing with tech products is properly reusing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-recycle-your-old-android-phone">whatever materials can be recycled</a>. These gadgets we love are filled with easily recycled materials, and if they end up buried in a landfill, that can&apos;t happen. Recycling not only helps keep costs in check, but it also helps leave the world in as good shape as possible for our kids and their kids.</p><p>The quick answer for anyone who doesn&apos;t feel like reading further is that any legitimate business that sells phones should know where to drop old ones off for recycling or be willing to take them from you for proper recycling. If all else fails, that&apos;s usually a great option.</p>
<p>This really showcases the one problem with the internet when it comes to gathering information — what applies to <em>me</em> may not be the case where <em>you</em> are. Many of the websites Google will index for a search about e-waste recycling are written by people who have easy access to a dedicated recycling program, either municipal or private. </p><p>That&apos;s not always the case and I know it&apos;s not because I don&apos;t have access to either option myself. I live in a rural area of the U.S. and I have no government-issued recycle boxes or centers for e-waste and private recycle-for-cash companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ecoatm.com/">ecoATM</a> don&apos;t have any boxes of kiosks anywhere near me. There is a recycling center, but it only takes plastic bottles and aluminum cans because it&apos;s for typical household waste.</p>
<p>I can (and do) recycle my old electronics, though. Here in the U.S., we call them "big box stores," and businesses like Best Buy, Lowe&apos;s, and Home Depot will accept e-waste and actually recycle it rather than just throw it in the dumpster.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="kk7y52Qo7PKsmoBtgrWW9K" name="AT&T-logo.jpg" alt="AT&T logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kk7y52Qo7PKsmoBtgrWW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might have similar stores in your area, and they may also partner with a recycling company that handles e-waste. It&apos;s worth asking if you don&apos;t notice a kiosk or bin near the front of the store.</p>
<p>Finally, and this should apply regardless of where you live, most stores that sell phones know how to recycle an old one even if they don&apos;t offer the service themselves. Here in the United States, any AT&T or Verizon store will take your old phones or tablets and make sure they are properly recycled. In Canada, Rogers will do the same.</p><p>In your area, you probably don&apos;t have an AT&T or Rogers phone store, but there&apos;s a good chance you have a large shop that deals with consumer electronics. They should be able to help you do the right thing and recycle your old gear.</p>
<p>Finally, one last thing to mention is never to send an old phone or tablet off for recycling without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-factory-reset-android-phone">erasing all of your data</a> from it. It&apos;s very difficult to extract data or sign in to an account on Android or iOS without knowing the correct password for the device, but it is possible. You probably aren&apos;t a celebrity or politician with people thirsting to read your private data, but you still have bank passwords and other financial information, as well as photos and other data that&apos;s pretty personal tied to your accounts. Be safe, and factory reset your device before it leaves your house.</p>

<ul><li>A set of alleged renderings for the Galaxy Tab S10's keyboard accessories have surfaced.</li><li>The images suggest the "Galaxy AI key" will pop into a slot between the right side Alt key and the D-Pad.</li><li>Samsung may also slightly tweak its keys by offering a separate row of function keys above the row of numbers.</li><li>The Galaxy Tab S10 series is rumored to drop in October alongside the rumored Galaxy S24 FE.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A batch of alleged Galaxy Tab S10 accessory renderings gives us an idea about Samsung&apos;s "Galaxy AI key."</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-official-images-of-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-covers/">YTECHB</a> reportedly obtained a batch of alleged renderings for the covers designed for the Galaxy Tab S10 series. A highlight of the rumors is evidence of a "Galaxy AI key" for the extra keyboard option. The images suggest the key will be nestled between the Alt Gr key and the D-Pad on the right side of the accessory.</p><p>Its design is fairly similar to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI icons, which all sport a multi-starred flair. The positioning of the key remains the same across the keyboard accessory with and without a trackpad.</p><p>Another noticeable difference is the keys on the keyboard. It seems Samsung will provide a separate row of keys for F1, F2, etc. Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-cases">with the Tab S9 series</a>, the keys were merged with the top row of climbing numbers.</p><p>Speaking of, the trackpad included variant looks thin as it offers a decent amount of space around the pad to rest your hand. There appears to be a hard-plastic raised portion with a clip for the Galaxy Tab S10 to rest upon. This isn&apos;t surprising as it&apos;s likely there for trackpad functionality. Leaked renderings of the non-trackpad version don&apos;t show such a pronounced pedestal for the Tab S10 to rest on.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung is seemingly continuing its offer of a Book Cover that can double as a kickstand. This should make it easy for users to quickly prop up their device to respond to a few emails before hitting the road again.</p><p>Images of the back of both rumored Cover accessories show cutouts for the dual camera array and a raised portion to accommodate the S Pen. The publication claims Samsung will offer the "Book Cover" and "Book Cover Slim" styles in black and white colorways.</p>

<p>Rumors started spreading about a supposed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-galaxy-ai-key-keyboard-rumor">Galaxy AI Key</a>" earlier this month. Early speculation claimed the button would offer a shortcut to Galaxy AI feature, but which tools users could find are still unknown. The existence of this for the Galaxy Tab S10&apos;s keyboard accessories was supposedly "confirmed" by a Samsung insider.</p><p>Once the tablets arrive, we&apos;ll have to see if this opens a Galaxy AI menu or, perhaps, a selection of our favorite tools.</p><p>Elsewhere, a major Galaxy Tab S10 leak might&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-specs-galaxy-ai-leak">exposed everything about the device</a> before launch. The Tab S10 Ultra is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display while the smaller Tab S10 Plus could see a 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen. Both are suspected to deliver a 2X "anti-reflection" atop the displays with thinner bezels.</p><p>Speculation about a large amount of Galaxy AI seems accurate, especially following a feature leak: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">Transcription</a>. Rumors add the tablet duo may debut with Circle to Search, Note Assist, Drawing Assist, Photo Assist, Interpreter, Live Translate, and Chat Assist.</p><p>On the flip side, it&apos;s hard to imagine Samsung offering the Tab S10 duo <em>with </em>a keyboard accessory. The Tab S9 Ultra arrived with a striking $1,200 price tag, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/imagine-paying-1200-dollars-for-tablet-without-keyboard">but without a keyboard included</a>, it seemed like a hard pill to swallow. Regardless, the Galaxy Tab S10 duo is rumored to pick up an October release date alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-video-and-pricing-leak">rumored Galaxy S24 FE</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Following an early preview of OxygenOS 15 (Android 15), a report claims OnePlus is moving toward an Apple-like future.</li><li>The software is seemingly adopting much of what iOS provides like volume slider animations, "Live Photos," and a Control Center rework.</li><li>Dynamic Island is also returning, which was a feature many Android fans weren't too impressed with, but Android OEMs copied it anyway.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is busy toiling away at OxygenOS 15, but recent rumors claim the company is heavily invested in an Apple-like design.</p><p>Following a supposed in-depth look at OxygenOS 15 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oxygenos-15-is-getting-an-ios-makeover/">SmartPrix</a>, the software will reportedly deliver a major rework to its Control Center. The early preview showed that OnePlus will implement a 2x2 media player, a simple brightness slider, and a 1x2 volume panel. The Control Center is also seemingly split into two areas to give users a clear separation between it and notifications.</p><p>The publication states that in OxygenOS 15, "swiping down from the left" will produce your collection of notifications. The company is also testing customization for the Center, letting users choose which tools are there (icons) and hide text.</p><p>With so much going on, the post states OnePlus added an option for users to revert the design to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-android-14-hands-on">OxygenOS 14</a> days, instead.</p><p>The rumors continue, stating that the OnePlus Dynamic Island variant will likely return for its Android 15 skin. Apparently, instead of sitting off-center at the top of your display, the new OxygenOS 15 version will sit directly in the center, encompassing the selfie camera.</p>

<p>The Apple similarities continue as the publication states the software may deliver "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/live-photos">Live Photos</a>." According to our sister site friends at iMore, Live Photos lets users on iPhone capture a 1.5-second clip of the photo they just captured. The video is stored on an iPhone (or Cloud) as a 15fps .MOV file in conjunction with your standard JPG.</p><p>The volume slider/panel is potentially receiving an animation change like iOS. The publication claims it will shrink (narrow) if pressed again. Additionally, OnePlus is reportedly working on new customization options for the lock screen. The preview showed options to create a 3D lock screen alongside tools to alter the size/position of the clock.</p><p>OnePlus is supposedly eyeing a late September or early October date for its OxygenOS 15 (Android 15) beta enrollment period.</p><p>Despite OnePlus&apos; seeming interest in shifting toward a more Apple-esque design, the Dynamic Island idea was arguably one of the most notable two years ago. Android users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island-poll-responses">weren&apos;t too impressed</a> by it during its showcase, but that didn&apos;t stop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/realme-c55-launch">the likes of Realme</a> and OnePlus from dropping their versions. Realistically, Android should&apos;ve done a "Dynamic Island" for the center <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dynamic-island-android-hole-punch-cameras-overhaul">punch-hole camera long ago</a>.</p><p>On a related note, it remains to be seen how OnePlus fans enjoy a more Apple-like approach. Samsung enjoyers alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">the company&apos;s execs were furious</a> following its recent Unpacked event. The Korean OEM truly embodied the idea of Apple&apos;s design philosophy as it moved away from what Galaxy used to look like. With OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS 15 (potentially) upon us, we&apos;ll have to see if the feedback received forces any changes.</p>

<ul><li>Motorola could be preparing to craft a sequel for a phone that consumers dodged: the ThinkPhone.</li><li>Rumors claim the device could be based on the company's recent Moto Edge 50 Neo with a 6.4-inch pOLED display and a 4,310mAh battery.</li><li>The original ThinkPhone from 2023 was an affordable flagship variant with a 6.6-inch display, a 5,000mAh battery, and the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One of Motorola&apos;s affordable devices, which flew under the radar a year ago, might pick up a sweet sequel.</p><p>Well-known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1837305765901545886">Evan Blass</a> posted an image of the Motorola ThinkPhone, suggesting the model could get another iteration. The image in question displays the "ThinkPhone" logo against what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/definition_of_i/status/1837308184534401341">one user suspects</a> is a carbon fiber rear panel. It&apos;s unclear if that&apos;s what Motorola is going for with this next device.</p><p>Regardless, the photo is a follow-up to another of Blass&apos; theories. The tipster claims the next ThinkPhone could be based on the Moto Edge 50 Neo (Vienna).</p><p>Additional rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/motorola-thinkphone-2025">Android Headlines</a> claim the "ThinkPhone 2025" will sport a 6.3-inch pOLED display with MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a> SoC. The publication suggests the phone will feature a 50MP primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP 3x optical zoom lens. The final camera is rumored to replace the original model&apos;s 2MP depth sensor.</p><p>Other rumors purport the ThinkPhone 2025 will shrink in size (as evidenced by its smaller display) and battery capacity, down to 4,310mAh. Memory and storage are speculated to arrive at 8/256GB, though it&apos;s unclear if that&apos;s the maximum consumers may experience or if it&apos;s one of two configurations.</p>

<p>Motorola started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-teaser-edge-50-neo-rumors">teasing the Edge 50 Neo</a> in August shortly before its launch later that month. The device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/we/smartphones-motorola-edge-50-neo/p?skuId=615">launched a week later</a> with a 6.4-inch pOLED display and Android 14. The phone&apos;s bezels aren&apos;t too thick on the sides of the display; however, the top and bottom seem to boast a slight chin.</p><p>The Edge 50 Neo offers MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7300 SoC and a 4,310mAh battery with 68W wired fast charging. RAM tops out at 12GB while its internal storage reaches 512GB at its maximum. With the current line of rumors, we can already see some similarities between the Edge 50 Neo and the supposed ThinkPhone 2025.</p><p>The original model was probably Moto&apos;s best phone that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/thinkphone-review-the-best-motorola-phone-you-wont-buy">consumers would never buy</a>. The company honed in on business-oriented folk with the device as it bridged the gap between your home and office life.  The phone delivered a 6.6-inch pOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate, a 5,000mAh battery, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1</a>.</p><p>In short, the O.G. ThinkPhone was an affordable flagship variant that offered deep PC integration with Moto&apos;s signature performance and battery life.</p><p>However, the current rumors suggest we&apos;re in for a few regressions as the phone drops in size and offers a much smaller battery. It&apos;ll likely affect its longevity, but we&apos;d have to playtest it to know for sure.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 FE is the next most awaited launch from the company since it already launched its flagship series and foldables. While the launch is getting nearer, new leaks have revealed everything to expect from the device, including the U.S. pricing.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1838221890348876237">Evan Blass on X</a> has shared what appears to be the official unboxing video of the upcoming Galaxy S24 FE made by Samsung for marketing purposes. The video reveals the handset in full, including its design, specs, and colors.</p>
<p>Per the video, the device will carry the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series&apos; renowned design, including flat sides, rounded corners, and the triple camera array at the back. The unboxing further shows the quick start guide, SIM ejector PIN, and the USB-C cable one would expect from any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>.</p><p>The latest colorways of the higher mid-range phone are blue, graphite, gray, mint, and yellow, corroborating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-colors-leaked-again">previous leaks</a>. Users can expect a 50MP wide-angle primary camera accompanied by a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera and an 8MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom capabilities. The Infinity-O display on the front will include a 10MP selfie shooter.</p>
<p>The teaser video further confirms that the Galaxy S24 FE will be powered by Samsung Exynos 2400e under the hood, which appears to be a toned version of the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> chipset that powered some of the Galaxy S24 models outside the U.S. </p><p>The display will measure around 6.69 inches and have a Full HD Plus resolution alongside 1900 nits peak brightness. For protection, the device will feature Corning Gorilla Glass Victus Plus for the display and the glass panel as well, which are joined by an aluminum frame in the middle.</p><p>The 4700mAh battery will keep the lights on, a bump from the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>&apos;s 4500mAh battery capacity. Lastly, users can also witness an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>

<p>While the teaser video reveals what the device will look like and what it has in store, another well-known tipster, OnLeaks, in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-price-in-us/">Smartprix</a>, has further shared the storage options next to the U.S. pricing. </p><p>The device will likely come in 128GB and 256GB onboard storage variants, costing $649 and $709, respectively. It is a bit pricer than the previous iteration, which cost $50 less during the launch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Kick the week off with a few updates for Google TV that&apos;ll help you keep tabs on everything from home devices to sports.</p><p>Today (Sept 23), Google detailed several updates preparing to roll out for Google TV devices. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/google-tv-home-ai-sports-features/">Keyword post</a>, the company highlighted the new "home panel" that&apos;ll hit devices soon. Users can control their smart home devices like smart lights, and thermostats, and view live camera feeds through this panel.</p><p>Google TV sets will also receive doorbell notifications, so you&apos;ll always know who&apos;s knocking (or ringing).</p><p>Struggling to find what to watch sucks, but struggling to find a sports game shouldn&apos;t suck, too. Google states this update packs a new sports tab on the "For You" page. This tab is said to be a collection of all relevant sports games, so users can find live games, upcoming games, and YouTube Highlights.</p><p>Additionally, all that you&apos;re subscribed to is getting an upgrade courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. Rolling out today (Sept 23), Gemini will hit Google TV with show summaries/overviews, season breakdowns, and more.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s AI influence continues as TV sets pick up an upgraded Ambient screensaver. The post states users will have Gen AI to lean on to take in prompts and create what they&apos;ve envisioned. Google will offer a series of "suggested prompts" that you can use and the AI will create a "one-of-a-kind image."</p><p>Alternatively, the company adds that you can ask Google Assistant to pull an image from your Photos app library.</p><p>One can get lost in free content, which is why Google TV Freeplay is snagging an update for its channel guide. The company now lets users search for a specific show genre or topic. Google has been doubling down on free content ever since it rebranded that hub on TVs to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-just-made-finding-free-content-on-the-roku-channel-even-easier">Freeplay</a>." Users are given access to over 150 curated FAST channels. Recently, the company brought easier search options for free channels on The Roku Channel.</p><p>Also, if some of these updates seem familiar (like déjà vu), then it&apos;s because of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>. Stepping in for Chromecast, the Google TV Streamer is a slim, sleek streaming box that packs all of a user&apos;s smart home tools and entertainment into one small package.</p><p>The streamer also features a deeply integrated experience with Gemini and the new "home panel."</p>

<ul><li>Oppo's upcoming Find X8 series should likely incorporate similarities to the latest iPhone 16 series.</li><li>The Find X8 models could include flat sides, rounded corners, a camera control button dubbed Quick Action, and narrow bezels.</li><li>The Find X8 series are rumored to launch with Dimensity 9400 SoC in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Oppo&apos;s Find X8 series is the company&apos;s much-awaited launch, which is slated to happen later this year. Ahead of the anticipated launch, the company&apos;s Chief Product Officer, Pete Lau, has shared a teaser image of the device placed right next to Apple&apos;s latest iPhone 16 series.</p><p>The same image has also been shared by Oppo&apos;s Find Series Product Manager, Zhou Yibao, on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/OxPHpDPg0">his Weibo account</a>. While Lau&apos;s X post doesn&apos;t specify which phones are being showcased in the shard image, it is still understandable as one is the latest Pro model of the iPhone 16 lineup, which has slimmer screen bezels all around than the predecessor models. The phone sitting next to it is evidently the upcoming Find X8 series device, which also features an identical narrow bezel similar to the iPhone.</p>

<p>Per the shared image, both phones look identical, to say the least, with narrower bezels, as mentioned. Tipster Ice Universe, however, noted in the comments, suggesting that the said comparison in the images is between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and the Oppo Find X8, which is believed to have narrower bezels than the former, notes the tipster. While the iPhone 16 Pro bezels have been reduced significantly, it will be interesting to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android counterparts</a> jumping on the bandwagon so early.</p><p>The similarities don&apos;t seem to end just with the bezels. This year, the iPhone 16 Pro and other models in the lot are equipped with a new Camera Control button that gives users several camera controls with just a tap.</p>

<p>Earlier, Ice Universe shared the image of the Find X8 series, which also includes a similar button right along the volume rockers and the power button. This button is likely to be dubbed the Quick Button and should include similar, if not better, functionalities. That could be another reason behind Pete Lau&apos;s new shared image on X.</p><p>The other interesting details from the previously shared image include a giant camera visor at the back of the Oppo Find X8. It is rumored to include a 50MP primary camera next to a 50MP ultra-wide angle lens and an additional 3x periscope zoom camera.</p>
<p>The other rumored device specs (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_find_x8_will_oneup_the_iphone_16_pro_in_one_key_area_-news-64623.php">GSMArena</a>) comprise a 6.7-inch LTPO display featuring Full HD Plus resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Underneath, the device is expected to be powered by MediaTek&apos;s latest Dimensity 9400 SoC, and keeping the lights on would be a whopping 5600mAh battery capacity.</p><p>It additionally supports 100W superfast charging speeds. According to the latest rumors, other nifty add-ons for the upcoming Find X8 that match Apple include Oppo&apos;s version of Dynamic Island and magnetic wireless charging. </p>
