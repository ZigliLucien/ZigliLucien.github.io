<p>The post states users can play the game in a DM with another person. All it takes is for you to tap on an emoji someone sent. The "ball" that you&apos;re playing pong will be whatever emoji it is you&apos;ve tapped. The game&apos;s background will change colors the longer and higher your score rises.</p><p>Instagram will also keep track of your high score at the top right corner.</p><p>Instagram&apos;s latest update in August brought a feature that&apos;ll have you thinking of MySpace (if you know what that is). Users could attach <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-letting-you-share-songs-right-from-your-profile">their favorite song</a> to their Instagram profile within their bio. Those who pay a visit can tap the song and begin listening if they choose.

The software came with a new feature called "Imagine Me," an AI tool that lets users become whatever they&apos;d like. After completing a series of brief steps, the AI will attempt to generate an image based on your query.</p><p>Meta AI uses your selfie to turn you into things like a DJ or an astronaut.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus were spotted passing through China's 3C for certification, which highlighted charging strength.</li><li>The S25 will seemingly stick with 25W charging while the S25 Plus could see 45W once more.</li><li>Both devices had rumored imagery leaks, showcasing potential design changes, such as a thinner design and a tweaked camera array.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another round of Samsung Galaxy leaks might&apos;ve peeled back the cover on the charging speeds for two of its upcoming models.</p><p>We&apos;re still a ways away from a Samsung Galaxy S launch; however, a database listing spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-s25-plus-charging-speeds-3c/">91Mobiles</a> involves the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-galaxy-s25-plus-45w-charging-speed/">SamMobile</a>). According to the post, Samsung&apos;s base and Plus models appeared in a China Compulsory Certification (3C) for certification, but its listing detailed repetitive charging speeds.</p><p>The former was spotted with 25W wired charging while the Galaxy S25 Plus was listed with 45W.</p><p>The publication&apos;s search also discovered that Samsung may not provide an adapter alongside these devices, which isn&apos;t particularly surprising as many phones from Samsung already don&apos;t ship with power adapters. The folks at SamMobile add that the devices could support USB PD with PPS (Programmable Power Supply) to regulate its charging temperature.</p><p>Samsung has been using the same wired charging speeds for years, and Android Central users found out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/45w-charging-times-disappointing-unfortunately.973233/">as long ago as 2019</a> that Samsung&apos;s "45W" chargers barely charge phones any faster than the 25W ones. At best, these phones charge a few minutes faster with a 45W charger, while competitor&apos;s phones fully <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-battery-charging-speeds">charge in about 30 minutes</a>. Unfortunately, we might be in for the same charging speeds <em>again </em>for another year, but that just means we&apos;ll have to look elsewhere for excitement.</p>

<p>We would say we&apos;re surprised by these rumors — but after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-wont-probably-blow-your-mind-with-its-battery-life">Galaxy S25 Ultra leaks</a>, that wouldn&apos;t make sense. The upcoming Ultra model was rumored to continue to offer a 5,000mAh capacity and 45W charging.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus were recently walking the rumored runway as a series of renders surfaced. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">base model&apos;s image</a>s showed it could offer a near-identical design to its predecessor; however, its vertical camera array could feature all-black rings around the lenses. A 6.2-inch display will likely welcome users like last year, but the phone might be slightly thinner.</p><p>The S25 Plus&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">alleged renderings</a> showed a similar vibe with its rear camera array and the black rings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Samsung could also make the device moderately thinner than its S24 variant, indicative of its shift toward a thin phone era.</p><p>Outside of specs, it seems Samsung is interested in plugging more of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-nano-v2-galaxy-s25-report-claim">Google&apos;s AI software</a> into its Galaxy S25 series. During an interview with Samsung&apos;s executive director of systems, Cho Cheol-min, it was revealed that the two companies were in talks to "evolve" the on-device AI of the S25.</p><p>The talks reportedly mentioned a "Gemini Nano 2" and that it might hit the next flagship trio.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is tipped to make the Galaxy Ring even more versatile by adding two new size options, 14 and 15, so more people can actually get a ring that fits.</p><p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> made its debut in February with sizes 5 to 13, people with larger fingers were out of luck. But now Samsung is about to roll out more sizes, making the ring more inclusive for everyone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/20/samsung-galaxy-ring-sizes-new-larger-options/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>) if a new tip on X from leaker Max Jambor is to be believed.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Galaxy Ring will be available in two additional sizes, 14 and 15, in the coming weeks pic.twitter.com/00vP18RAKq<a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1837049336821092706">September 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung’s supposed decision to expand the Galaxy Ring’s size range is a smart play to boost its market reach. Since not everyone has the same hand size, this move is bound to make the ring more appealing to a broader crowd.</p><p>According to the tipster, sizes 14 and 15 for the Galaxy Ring might drop in the next few weeks. However, Samsung has not officially announced a release date for these new options.</p><p>If you&apos;re eyeing the Galaxy Ring but unsure about the size, Samsung’s got a handy sizing kit to help. Since the ring&apos;s sensors can make your usual ring size a bit tricky, the kit includes samples of all the available sizes. It’s definitely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-find-the-right-samsung-galaxy-ring-size">worth trying out to find the perfect fit before you buy</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is packed with health-tracking features, letting users keep tabs on their well-being around the clock. We weren&apos;t particularly impressed with the company&apos;s efforts in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring review</a>, but most of the issues are software-related, meaning Samsung could eventually iron them out via updates.</p><p>Even with all its high-tech features, it’s super light, weighing just 2.3 to 3.0 grams, making it comfortable for all-day wear.</p><p>Beyond the size updates, Samsung is also said to be expanding the Galaxy Ring&apos;s reach. Pre-registrations are kicking off in Mexico, and Brazilians can already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/br/samsung-anuncia-galaxy-ring-no-brasil" target="_blank">pre-order</a> the ring, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-availability-expanding-to-more-markets/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>In Brazil, the Galaxy Ring is set to hit the market on October 19, with pre-orders closing a day earlier. However, would-be Mexican customers will have to wait a bit longer for their turn.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring comes in three colors: Titanium Black, Titanium Gold, and Titanium Silver. No matter which size or color you choose, it’s priced at $400 across the board.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors are beginning to surface about the next OnePlus flagship phone and its potential toll on consumers&apos; wallets.</p><p>Rumors alleged by known Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5080346158697790">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) suggest the OnePlus 13 will arrive with 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_13_to_have_an_insane_amount_of_memory-news-64614.php">GSMArena</a>). The tipster states the company&apos;s next phone "is the only one" of the next wave of flagships to feature such a high amount of memory.</p><p>The post adds that the amount of memory will remain consistent "for the whole series." It&apos;s unclear if this is eluding toward the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-oneplus-13r-likely-to-look-different-in-design">OnePlus 13R</a> or not. So, we&apos;ll have to take this particular statement with a grain of salt.</p><p>That&apos;s not all as DCS states this extra RAM option could come at a cost — for the customer. Rumors claim the top configuration of the OnePlus 13 "will be higher this time."</p><p>Unfortunately, DCS doesn&apos;t give a ballpark estimate of what we could expect in terms of price this time. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> launched in January for $799 at its base 12/256GB configuration and at $899 for its max 16/512GB option. A 24GB RAM is typically paired with a 1TB storage buddy. These rumors don&apos;t suggest such a thing; however, it doesn&apos;t stop us from wondering if the OnePlus 13 could push $1,000 considering the recent rumors.</p>

<p>Following rumors of an earlier OnePlus launch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-making-its-debut-way-sooner-than-expected">company&apos;s president recently confirmed</a> that the 13 series will arrive in October. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">Leaked benchmarks</a> show that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 inside the OnePlus 13 achieves astonishing power levels that are higher than even the iPhone 16&apos;s Apple A18 chip. OnePlus president Louis Lee teased the 13&apos;s power, stating it can run Hoyoverse&apos;s Genshin Impact at 120fps </p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-battery-specifications-rumor">leaks claim</a> the OnePlus 13 could give consumers enough power to get them going with a 6,000mAh battery. Those rumors added that the company could chuck in 100W wired fast charging alongside 50W wireless charging strength. The latter was previously rumored to skip the 13; however, rumors are now pulling us in the opposite direction.</p><p>Photography rumors purport the OnePlus 13 could take its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">auxiliary lenses u</a>p to 50MP (ultrawide/periscope). We&apos;ll have to see how all of this pans out in October. Qualcomm is expected to host its annual Summit that same month, meaning the OnePlus 13 could launch shortly after.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon ads on streaming platform Peacock confirm the Meta Quest 3s will start at $299 and launch on October 16, 2024.</li><li>The Meta Quest 3s has been rumored for months as Meta's new budget-minded VR headset, with an announcement expected on September 25 at Meta Connect.</li><li>The headset is said to feature the same chipset as the Quest 3, enabling it to play Quest 3-exclusive games at a budget price.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>For months, rumors have been circulating that Meta will unveil the Meta Quest 3s this fall, a new budget headset that can play Quest 3 exclusive games.</p><p>Now, one user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1fl01lp/299_quest_3s_128gb_confirmed_by_amazon_ad_on/">on Reddit</a> saw an Amazon ad while watching something on the streaming service Peacock, confirming the rumored $299 price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3s</a> was true. That puts it at $200 less than the Meta Quest 3, making it far easier on budgets as big games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> launch with Quest 3 exclusivity. In that same Reddit thread, users also posted Amazon Australia listings showing an October 16, 2024 release date.</p><p>In the ad, pictured below, the fine print notes that the Meta Quest 3s 128GB model will retail for $299, putting it at the same price the 64GB Oculus Quest 2 launched at back in 2020. That&apos;s a huge deal given how many other electronics have succumbed to inflation this year, including popular consoles like the PS5.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.71%;"><img id="49UJBMqraR8xVfyMsAjmk5" name="meta-quest-3s-price-amazon-ad.jpg" alt="A screenshot of an Amazon ad from Vast_Front259 on Reddit showing the price of the Meta Quest 3s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/49UJBMqraR8xVfyMsAjmk5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vast_Front259 from Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta&apos;s strategy of offering multiple SKUs within the Meta Quest 3 name feels very similar to Microsoft&apos;s strategy with the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S. Both consoles are considered part of the same generation and can play the same games, but the Xbox Series S makes some hardware concessions to hit a much more attractive $299 price.</p><p>Likewise, the Meta Quest 3s is said to use the same powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset that&apos;s in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>—enabling it to run Quest 3 exclusive games—while using the same Fresnel lenses from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a>. Using these older lenses would save money as they&apos;re less complicated to manufacture than the clearer pancake lenses in the Quest 3. Meta is also said to be cutting the 3.5mm headset jack, so users will need to pick up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW/">VR-certified earbuds</a> if they don&apos;t want to use the included over-the-ear speakers.</p><p>While pancake lenses are clearer than Fresnel ones, they require much brighter screens to display the same image quality as Fresnel ones. In other words, Meta can use a cheaper display and still get away with good brightness levels on the Quest 3s, saving money on the hardware side. As a downside, Fresnel lenses are physically larger than pancake ones, so the Quest 3s is expected to be a larger headset than the Quest 3, though still slightly smaller than a Quest 2.</p><p>The Quest 3s is expected to ship with the same great controllers as the Meta Quest 3, though, as well as similar full-color passthrough cameras. That means the overall experience should be similar for many. We expect to see the Meta Quest 3s officially announced at Meta Connect on September 25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-meta-connect-2024">alongside several other new Meta products</a>.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube confirmed that ads for paused videos have arrived.</li><li>Users noticed the new ad placement ahead of YouTube's official statement as they appeared on smart TVs and mobile devices.</li><li>YouTube detailed an experiment with picture-in-picture ads in August for mid-roll ads, but that same idea has seemingly struck paused content.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube&apos;s pause button is now a portal to ads.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248391/youtube-pause-ads-widely-rolling-out">The Verge</a>, YouTube confirmed that ads for paused videos are a new reality for viewers. The platform&apos;s communications manager, Oluwa Falodun, stated: "As we’ve seen both strong advertiser and strong viewer response, we’ve since widely rolled out Pause ads to all advertisers."</p><p>Users noticed these new ads on the pause screen last week, as a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/youtube-pause-ads-rolling-out/">Tech-Issues Today</a> noted (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/11/youtube-pause-ad-tv-update/">9to5Google</a>). Several threads appeared on YouTube&apos;s subreddit with users showcasing ads after they paused their videos. The ad appeared on the right half of their display and seemingly shrunk paused videos to the left.</p><p>The issue even appeared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1fhqzaa/why_does_an_ad_pop_up_every_time_i_pause/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe">on a mobile device</a> as the advertisement rose from the bottom of their display.</p><p>The publication adds that this was a long time coming as YouTube kicked off a limited test of this new ad variant last year. During Alphabet&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 2024 earnings call</a>, Google&apos;s Philipp Schindler told The Verge: "Advertisers unsurprisingly love them!" Moreover, the idea of ads on paused videos is "commanding premium pricing from advertisers."</p><p>Regarding the current situation, YouTube says ads for paused videos were designed to be "less disruptive."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seriously @YouTube? You're putting up ads when you pause a video now?I am about to install a computer in place of the fire stick so I can have an ad blocker... Your ads are getting ridiculous. pic.twitter.com/OT4JMduGTU<a href="https://twitter.com/Roaether/status/1832186161743216724">September 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>We&apos;ve heard the idea of "less disruptive" ads on YouTube before, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tests-less-disruptive-mid-roll-ads">that involved mid-roll ads</a>, not adding ones when paused.</p><p>In August, the platform was spotted experimenting with picture-in-picture (PIP) mid-roll ads. The test explained that the ads would shrink a viewer&apos;s video to advertise it. Users wouldn&apos;t miss out on their viewing experience, and YouTube would still get the point across.</p><p>It&apos;s similar to a football broadcast not taking you away from the game during a thirty-second timeout. However, what we&apos;re seeing now, at least for smart TVs, are the echoes of that PIP experiment from August.</p><p>Let&apos;s also not forget YouTube&apos;s current war against ad blockers, which might force it to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-server-side-injectable-ads-test">server-side ads into videos</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Lately, most of the things I write about Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">seem negative</a>. That happens when the company continues to do things people disapprove of, but it&apos;s still a bit of a drag. I imagine it&apos;s just as much of a drag to read bad press about Google all of the time if you&apos;re entrenched in its ecosystem of devices or software.</p><p>Today is different. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/google-arts-culture-colombia-amazon/">blog post from Google</a> reminded me about one of the reasons I use Google products and how much I enjoy some of them. Case in point: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-arts-and-culture-redesign">Google Arts & Culture app</a>.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not a particularly fancy or artsy guy, at least not as much as I wish I were. But I do enjoy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-stolen-art-gallery-review">seeing and learning about beautiful things</a>, both natural and from the minds and hands of mankind. That&apos;s why I installed the app in the first place; it gives us a glimpse of things we might not ever be able to see otherwise.</p><p>The app itself also has other features that let you build a gallery or morph your selfies. You can even find art that looks like you or your dog. I mostly use it to explore the world around me, though. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cultural">If you&apos;ve never looked at it, you should</a>.</p>

<p>As I was cruising through my reading list, I came across Google telling and showing me work in Columbia studying ancient art. Found along the edge of the Amazon, this prehistoric art tells a story about the culture and myths of the Jiw people, an ethnic group that still lives in the La Lindosa region today.</p><p>People at the University of Exeter at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/project/la-lindosa">working to study and preserve</a> this ancient art and that&apos;s fabulous. They know about things like this. I only learned of it today, because Google showcased it for me. I mentioned I&apos;m not particularly artsy and I&apos;m not much of an archeologist, either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:360px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="z5aof5RM28pAmeZubAYW8H" name="Google-arts-and-culture-croatia.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Google Arts & Culture app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5aof5RM28pAmeZubAYW8H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="360" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am curious about a lot of different things, and Google has often shown me something marvelous through the Arts & Culture app—things I probably would never have heard of otherwise. I can&apos;t help but think that&apos;s fabulous.</p>
<p>When we think of Google, we probably think about things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">smartphones</a>, software platforms, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">AI</a>, and other tech-centric ideas. That&apos;s what Google is known for because that&apos;s the bulk of what it does. </p><p>Google also does plenty of things I think it shouldn&apos;t, and I&apos;m not alone in that way of thinking. I enjoy having an opportunity and a platform to call Google out for everything I think is terrible. I also enjoy being able to appreciate something the company does that provides a few minutes of joy.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other things Google does that people approve of, too. The company provides the essential service of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/">auditing internet software</a> for exploits that could compromise our online safety. It spends money, time, and resources on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.google/research-areas/health-bioscience/">medical research</a> into things like cancer and disease diagnosis and epidemiological studies. These sorts of things are more important than an app that lets me see and learn about the beautiful things I&apos;ll never get to see, even if they don&apos;t feel as personal.</p><p>I tend to forget about the good a tech company can do when all I see is anticompetitive behavior, broken promises, and huge defense contracts. The good things are still there, though. All we need to do is look for them.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-prime-big-deal-days-2">What is Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>
<p>Set to kick off on October 8th and run for 48 hours, Amazon&apos;s Big Deal Days is basically an autumnal Prime Day, featuring hundreds of exclusive deals for anyone who has a Prime membership. </p><p>Everything from smartphones and laptops to clothing and kitchen appliances is expected to go on sale, so now would be a good time to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for Prime</strong></a> if you haven&apos;t yet. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-next-prime-day-2">When is the next Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Although it&apos;s not <em>technically </em>Prime Day, Amazon&apos;s 48-hour Big Deal Days sale is essentially the same thing and it&apos;s set to kick off on October 8th. </p><p>If you&apos;re looking for the next <em>official </em>Prime Day, you can probably expect that sale to go live sometime in mid-July 2025. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-member-to-get-the-deals-2">Do I have to be a member to get the deals?</h2>
<p>Yep. Just like Amazon&apos;s regular Prime Day sale event in July, the vast majority of deals during Big Deal Days will only be available to Prime members. Fortunately, if you don&apos;t want to pay, you could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> and enjoy access to all of the best deals without paying a dime. </p>
