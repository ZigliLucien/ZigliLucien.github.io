But you may need to help Discover figure out what those interests are or steer it away from boring topics its algorithm <em>thinks</em> you like.</p><p>You can find Google Discover in several locations: the Google mobile app on Android, iOS, or iPad, in your mobile web browser of choice at google.com, or if you swipe right from your home screen on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-discover-feed-for-desktops-in-the-works">tested Discover on desktop</a> but hasn&apos;t rolled out this feature officially.</p><p>Wherever you use Discover, we&apos;re here to help improve your experience. This is how to personalize your Google Discover feed, manage interests and topics, create collections of content to return to, like and save stories, and more.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-save-your-web-app-activity"><span>Save your Web & App activity</span></h2>

<p>The more collective, unified data Google has on your search results, the better your Google Discover results will be. Google usually pings and prods you into personalizing and sharing your Google data, but here&apos;s what to do if you haven&apos;t already done so.</p><p>In the <strong>Google app</strong>, tap your <strong>Profile pic or initials</strong>. Tap <strong>Your data in Search </strong>or <strong>Search History</strong>, whichever option is visible. Then tap the <strong>Controls</strong> tab and <strong>turn on Web & App Activity</strong> if you haven&apos;t already done so. You may also want to toggle <strong>Subsettings,</strong> like including your Google Assistant search results or including "activity from sites, apps, and devices that use Google services."</p><p>Then scroll further down the page and turn <strong>Personal results</strong> to On. Without this, your Discover feed won&apos;t include stories based on your search history. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-follow-sites-or-searches"><span>Follow sites or searches</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rxTT8uVRMNztEkeFE9mviU" name="google-discover-follow-topics-screenshots.jpg" alt="How to follow topics and searches in Google Discover" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rxTT8uVRMNztEkeFE9mviU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Discover pulls its article suggestions from your entire Google browsing history. Some ways to customize Discover can only be done through Chrome.</p><p>Set Chrome as your default browser on Android and then go to any website you&apos;re interested in; if you tap the <strong>More (...) button</strong>, you&apos;ll see an option to <strong>Follow</strong> that website at the menu&apos;s bottom. That site&apos;s content should appear more frequently in Discover, in addition to the "Following" tab in Chrome.</p><p>Another simple method is to tap any story in Discover; it should open in Chrome (your default browser), where you can then tap the More button and follow that site.</p><p>Following isn&apos;t solely for websites. Let&apos;s say you frequently search for news or leaks of your favorite show or celeb — aka "Squid Game season 2 news" — or deals on a specific device. Simply enter that search term in Chrome or the Google app and then <strong>scroll down</strong> repeatedly until Google stops showing new results. At the very bottom, you&apos;ll see "More results" and <strong>Follow this search</strong>. Tap the second option, and Discover will prioritize news on that topic moving forward.</p><p>When you follow sites, your Discover feed will often show recent articles grouped together, which can help you keep track of things you may have missed.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-like-save-and-organize-articles"><span>Like, save, and organize articles</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UTLVnmPgRH4pu3c7mH2S6U" name="google-discover-interests-screenshots.jpg" alt="The Interests tab in Google Discover, showing Likes, Topics, and Collections." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTLVnmPgRH4pu3c7mH2S6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth spelling out the obvious here, even if most of you know this step already: telling Google that you like something is the best way to get future content in that same vein. If you tap on a Discover article, Google will assume that you find it interesting; you can make that assumption more concrete by "liking" articles afterward.</p><p>After you tap a Discover article and find it interesting, tap the <strong>X or ﹀ icon</strong> to return to Discover, then tap the <strong>heart icon</strong> to save it to your <strong>Liked</strong> articles in the <strong>Interests</strong> tab. </p><p>In Interests, you can <strong>+ Create</strong> a collection of your choosing. The tab will automatically create certain groupings for you based on Discover links, Google Maps addresses, or other saved/liked content. You might want to save your favorite restaurants or places you want to go or create a list of important articles to reference for your work. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgLcRV3R4vJ24Us6cqDoPU" name="google-discover-create-collection-screenshots.jpg" alt="How to create Collections of Liked articles in Google Discover" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgLcRV3R4vJ24Us6cqDoPU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you&apos;ve created that list, search for a relevant site, product, or page in the <strong>Google app</strong> and tap the <strong>save icon</strong> in the top-right corner, and it&apos;ll save that page to your latest collection. If you want it to go to a different collection, tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the "Saved to Collection" pop-up that appears and choose the right collection. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unfollow-topics-and-sites"><span>Unfollow topics and sites</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PqrPRWYjrZAjgrzkzEWPhT" name="google-discover-unfollow-topics-screenshots.jpg" alt="How to unfollow topics and websites on Google Discover" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqrPRWYjrZAjgrzkzEWPhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your first instinct using Discover will be to scroll past things you&apos;re uninterested in. Early on, my recommendation is to take the time to tell Google that you don&apos;t like certain websites or topics. </p><p>Under each Discover link, you&apos;ll see icons for <strong>liking</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, or <strong>more options</strong> (the ellipsis). That last button lets you tell Google that you&apos;re uninterested in a <strong>specific article</strong>, in a <strong>topic</strong>, or in <strong>content from a specific site</strong>. </p><p>Google might know that you&apos;re a gamer but not know that you&apos;re uninterested in Elden Ring or find one site untrustworthy, which is an important distinction. You may also like seeing YouTube results in Discover but decide to tap <strong>Don&apos;t show content from [Channel name] on YouTube</strong> instead of blocking all YouTube links. </p><p>If Google Discover tries to sell you something, you can tell Google you&apos;re uninterested or <strong>not shopping</strong> for this category, or to <strong>don&apos;t show product results for 30 days</strong> if you&apos;re uninterested in all marketing. </p><p>Don&apos;t worry if you say you&apos;re uninterested in a topic by mistake or change your mind. Tap <strong>more options > Manage your interests > Not interested</strong> under any article, and you&apos;ll find a list of topics and sites that are "hidden." Then tap the red icon next to any of them to make those results visible again. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update-the-discover-carousel"><span>Update the Discover carousel</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X2VE5fyBvkbbMRJrL6KD5V" name="google-discover-customize-carousel.jpg" alt="How to customize the Google Discover carousel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X2VE5fyBvkbbMRJrL6KD5V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the top of Google Discover, you&apos;ll find a carousel showing your local weather and air quality, stocks and market trends, and sports scores. Google guesses what you&apos;re interested in, but you can make that clearer. </p><p><strong>Swipe left</strong> to the end of the Carousel and tap <strong>Settings</strong>. You can check or uncheck boxes for specific topics or tap <strong>Manage your sports/ finance interests</strong> to add specific stocks, funds, currencies, sports leagues, or teams to follow. </p>

<p>Google doesn&apos;t have many hidden Google Discover tricks. Unlike Chrome, which has many more features and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> tools, Discover is meant to be a straightforward feed for you to glance at and spot interesting, curated articles in a few seconds.</p><p>Making your Discover feed more personalized gives Google more data to build an advertising profile, which you might find annoying. But it also means less time scrolling through results that you find uninteresting or at sites that know how to game SEO but don&apos;t have anything worthwhile to tell you.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for other guides on making better use of Google apps, check out our guide on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">top 15 tips and tricks for Google Chrome</a> or how to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-google-search-widget">customize the Google Search widget</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Meta Quest 2 (once called the Oculus Quest 2) is nearing its fourth birthday, and we&apos;re expecting to see some major deals happen this year, particularly once Amazon Prime Day rolls around, which we expect may happen in the coming weeks. We&apos;ve seen the headset hit as low as $99 leading up to the expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">Prime Day 2024</a> date, and a price like that is the only time you should still consider picking one up.</p><p>That&apos;s because, like any console that&apos;s been around for a while, buying one at a discount means you&apos;ll be missing out on some of the best new games and features that 2024 has delivered so far. Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> will be Quest 3-exclusive, like Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, Alien: Isolation, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-story-interview">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, to name a few.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Several upcoming games will be Quest 3-exclusive, but the Quest 2 can still play the classics.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>FOMO is a real thing, and seeing lots of new Meta Quest games come out with no Quest 2 support might make you regret your purchase. As a gamer, there are only a few reasons I&apos;d still recommend picking up a Quest 2 at a crazy discount this year.</p><p>First, it&apos;s a great way to get into VR gaming without spending much cash. The Quest 2 still runs 99% of Meta Quest games, including <em>all</em> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>. If you&apos;re currently not a VR gamer and just want to give it a try, this is an excellent way to do that.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">play VR games with my son</a> all the time, and he uses a Meta Quest 2. We have yet to run into any games that we want to play that don&apos;t support a Quest 2. While that&apos;ll eventually happen, the vast majority of games play on it just fine.</p><p>If you find that you enjoy the experience, I&apos;d recommend picking up a new headstrap and a new face pad from our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-oculus-quest-2">best Quest 2 accessories</a>.</p><p>Other folks might want to consider a potential $99 Quest 2 as a secondary headset for local multiplayer or even as a dedicated PCVR headset. The Quest 2 can be used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-play-steamvr-quest">as a SteamVR headset</a> indefinitely, even when Meta eventually discontinues support for it in the future, giving the device some added longevity.</p><p>That would give you access to Half-Life: Alyx and many other games that aren&apos;t on Quest at all, although it won&apos;t solve the problem of giving you access to Meta-developed titles like Batman Arkham Shadows since that&apos;s Quest 3-exclusive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4PVrYFvAAVDASvrXjjVVeg" name="batman-arkham-shadow-official-trailer-still-batman-mob.jpg" alt="A still captured from the official story reveal trailer of Batman Arkham Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4PVrYFvAAVDASvrXjjVVeg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only that, but mixed reality content is only available on the Quest Pro and Quest 3. The Quest 2 does have passthrough video so you can see the room around you when you put the headset on, but it&apos;s very low resolution and only in black and white.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>PCVR gamers might want to consider the Quest 2 as a cheap option.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>All the latest mixed reality and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/an-update-just-fixed-the-biggest-quest-3-mixed-reality-problem">passthrough quality improvements</a> have been made for the Quest 3 since that headset features substantially higher-resolution cameras and delivers full-color video passthrough vision, as well. In other words, while the Quest 3 is a mixed-reality headset that helps meld the virtual and real worlds together, the Quest 2 is very much a VR-only headset that&apos;ll make you feel more isolated.</p><p>If newer games or mixed reality sound like things you want—but you still don&apos;t want to spend $500 on a regular Quest 3—rumor has it that Meta is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> later this year.</p><p>That headset is purported to pack in the same powerful processor as the more expensive Quest 3—which means it would support all Quest 3-exclusive games like the ones mentioned above—but pack in the Quest 2&apos;s last-generation lenses and some other cost-savings to keep the price around $299 or less.</p><p>That&apos;s obviously a lot more than a potential $99 Quest 2 sale, but if you can keep it around for a few years and still get access to all the latest games, it might very well be worth waiting for.</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy published an op-ed in The New York Times this week, calling for a warning label on social media sites.</li><li>Murthy says the mental harms of social media sites warrant the label, which has been used in the past to highlight the dangers of substances like alcohol and tobacco. </li><li>The U.S. Surgeon General cannot require the warning label by himself. That would require a bill passed by Congress. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The debate of whether social media is linked to the declining mental health of adolescents has been raging on, and it reached new heights this week. It stated when Vivek Murthy, who is the U.S. Surgeon General, published an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/health/social-media-kids-mental-health.html" target="_blank">op-ed</a> in The New York Times calling for a warning label to be placed on social media sites, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram">Instagram</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law">TikTok</a>. Warning labels like the one proposed for social media have been used for alcohol and cigarettes in the past.</p><p>"It is time to require a surgeon general’s warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents," explained Murthy. "A surgeon general’s warning label, which requires congressional action, would regularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe."</p><p>Murthy cited the effectiveness of warning labels for tobacco products, as well as studies that referenced the harms associated with social media use. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2749480" target="_blank">study</a> found that children and teens who spent more than three hours daily on social media are twice as likely to face anxiety. Murthy notes that the average social media use for adolescents as of Summer 2023 was well above this threshold, at 4.8 hours. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kZXxVkNFAG79iMrjjfKfaR" name="social-media-apps.jpg" alt="Social Media Apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZXxVkNFAG79iMrjjfKfaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, Murthy&apos;s two statements — that "social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents" and "social media has not been proved safe" — are two very different claims. It&apos;s somewhat agreed upon that we don&apos;t know the full effects of social media use at young ages, and we may not know the full effects for years or decades. The claim that social media has a direct association with mental health harms is more controversial.</p><p>"The results have been really mixed, with probably the consensus being that no, it’s not related," said Mitch Prinstein, a doctor who is the chief science officer for the American Psychological Association, in a New York Times <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/health/social-media-kids-mental-health.html" target="_blank">article</a>.</p><p>"It’s kind of like saying, &apos;Is the number of calories that you eat good for you or bad for you?&apos;" Prinstein continued. "It depends. Is it candy, or is it vegetables? If your child is spending all day on social media following The New York Times feed and talking about it with their friends, that’s probably fine, you know?"</p><p>Social media sites, and the companies and executives that run them, have already faced heavy congressional scrutiny. In fact, Prinstein himself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023-02-14%20-%20Testimony%20-%20Prinstein.pdf" target="_blank">testified</a> in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about the effects of social media on children in February 2023. It is Congress, not Murthy, who has the authority to place a Surgeon General&apos;s warning label on social media sites and apps. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nrtbBKVQkHk8G92xTx7MDR" name="Instagram-Threads-app-cover-screen-02.jpg" alt="The cover screen for the Instagram Threads social app on a Motorola Edge+ (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrtbBKVQkHk8G92xTx7MDR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, Murthy&apos;s position on social media does hold significant weight among lawmakers and government leaders. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, already banned phone use in state schools following Murthy&apos;s call for a warning label. Even if the Surgeon General&apos;s warning label does not get passed by Congress, this conversation will certainly affect how governments and the public view social media sites.</p>
<h2 id="is-a-warning-label-the-right-call-2">Is a warning label the right call?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="8ZKDJUHPgucMghz5HGKrQZ" name="Instagram-logo.jpg" alt="Instagram logo on a smartphone lying flat on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ZKDJUHPgucMghz5HGKrQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Murthy makes a lot of good points about how to combat social media use among adolescents, but the warning label may be the least effective one. As one of Android Central&apos;s youngest resident "Gen Z-ers," I&apos;ve grown up with social media. I got my first internet-connected device when I was in elementary school and my first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphone</a> in middle school. However, that&apos;s different than what kids coming up today are facing. I had roughly 10 formative years without technology, the internet, and social media being a major part of my life. Younger generations will be lucky to get a few. </p><p>The best example of why a surgeon general&apos;s warning label will only be a small part of deterring social media usage by adolescents, ironically, is how it was used on cigarettes and tobacco products. Going through high school and college, I had never even heard of someone my age smoke an old-fashioned cigarette. It wasn&apos;t even talked about. </p><p>People in my generation knew about the dangers of cigarettes from a young age, watched loved ones and family friends who smoked suffer from potentially-fatal health problems, and saw what felt like an endless slate of ad campaigns against tobacco use throughout our early years. I&apos;d argue that it wasn&apos;t the Surgeon General&apos;s warning labels that all but eliminated cigarette use among adolescents. It was other things, from the age requirements, to the known health risks, to most importantly the change in public perception. </p><p>There&apos;s no reason to think combatting social media will require a different approach. A warning label only sparks a discussion, but the discussion has been front-and-center for years already. It&apos;ll take a change in behavior, with a bit of regulation, to make a real difference. That&apos;s why Murthy&apos;s other guidance — including "phone-free" zones, waiting until middle school to start social media usage, and education by parents and doctors — are likely to have a much greater effect than his proposed warning label. </p>

You probably use biometrics to do it, but did you know you could use a built-in Lockdown mode to force your phone to fall back to the PIN or password on a one-time basis?</p><p>It&apos;s one of those things you might not have known about and maybe have no idea why anyone would want such a thing. It&apos;s also one of those things you need to know about before it&apos;s time to use it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-lockdown-mode-2">What is Lockdown mode?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:117.04%;"><img id="evNrfy3xkB6qUVg9edeSu4" name="Lockdown.png" alt="Lockdown mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/evNrfy3xkB6qUVg9edeSu4.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1264" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your new phone</a>, you&apos;re given the opportunity to set up a lock screen. You&apos;ll need to set a password or a PIN (Personal Identification Number), and you can then add a way to unlock your phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-android-save-your-fingerprints">using your fingerprints</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-face-unlock-upgrade">face unlock</a>. </p><p>Most people choose to do this because it&apos;s convenient. Unlocking your phone decrypts its contents and it&apos;s also the method used for things like your bank&apos;s app or to spend money on digital purchases from Google Play or the App Store. Both Google and Apple have spent a lot of time to make sure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11s-new-biometric-security-means-all-your-apps-can-work-pixel-4s-face-unlock">biometrics are secure</a> and easy to use.</p>
<p>Every so often you need to enter that password or PIN to unlock your phone even if you have a fingerprint set. How often depends on which phone you have, but you&apos;ll see this at least once per day. You can force this behavior at any time by enabling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-lockdown-mode-pixel-4">Lockdown mode</a>.</p><p>Different phones have different ways to enable it. On a Google Pixel, just hold the power button for more than one second and you&apos;ll see it in the menu. On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-lockdown-mode-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">a Galaxy phone</a>, you enable it in the settings under <strong>Biometrics and Security</strong> then an icon will appear in your quick settings. On an iPhone, it&apos;s not called Lockdown mode, but you can disable FaceID on a one-time basis by pressing the side button and a volume button at the same time.</p>
<p>On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, lockdown mode disables biometrics and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-use-wear-os-watch-unlock">trusted devices</a>, voice recognition, and lock screen notifications. Every phone maker offers a way to enable it, and you probably didn&apos;t even know it was there.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-use-this-2">Why should I use this?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.75%;"><img id="gRmv4zTpYQ8pHa9K9G5vdM" name="samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-fingerprint.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra Fingerprint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gRmv4zTpYQ8pHa9K9G5vdM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You should use lockdown mode whenever you want to make sure the only way to unlock your phone is by knowing and entering the passcode. A lot of people will have a specific need for it such as being a heavy sleeper with sneaky roommates, but there is one common (and controversial) use case that some people call "cop mode."</p><p>In the United States, law enforcement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jsberrylaw.com/blog/can-police-officers-force-you-to-unlock-your-cellphone/">can force you</a> to place your fingertip on a sensor or keep your eyes open and head still to unlock your phone. However, they can not force you to provide a passcode. Lockdown mode is an easy way to keep law enforcement out of your phone.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not going to jump into the argument over this being good or bad because only you know if you want to give authorities access to your device. It&apos;s your phone, and it&apos;s filled with your information, so you get to decide who to share it with. Having said that, it&apos;s equally important to provide people who choose not to share it with a method to do so.</p><p>We see anecdotes about police or border agents rifling through someone&apos;s phone regularly on social media or YouTube. I&apos;m going to imagine the ones doing the rifling think they have a good reason for doing it. Some of us may disagree. Either way, it&apos;s a thing that does happen, so you need to decide how you feel about it before it can happen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="J6zG83s5Ph6y4Nh3toQMYU" name="google-io-wallet-drivers-license.jpg" alt="screen shot from Google I/O" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6zG83s5Ph6y4Nh3toQMYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I happen to think that nobody, including law enforcement, should have free rein over my phone, but don&apos;t expect anyone to agree with me—you do you. If you think like me, know that some potential issues may arise.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">Digital driver&apos;s licenses</a> are already here in some places and will be coming to your state/country eventually. However, there are some things you should be aware of. You cannot show your digital ID or a barcode to an officer if your phone is in Lockdown mode. You can&apos;t show proof of insurance via a digital ID card if your phone is in Lockdown mode. Failing to provide either of these things will lead to a situation that has you in violation of the law.</p>
<p>You also can&apos;t call your spouse or anyone else while your phone is in Lockdown mode, and entering Lockdown mode will stop any video recording in progress. It really does make your phone useless until you enter the passcode.</p><p>What&apos;s really important here is that phone makers and the people who write the software that powers them gave us a choice. You should know about it and how it works even if you have never decided to use it.</p>

<p>Xreal has introduced the Beam Pro, its newest AR product. But it&apos;s not another pair of AR glasses like before. Instead, it&apos;s an improved version of the Xreal Beam that tackles all the issues with the earlier model.</p><p>At this week&apos;s Augmented World Expo (AWE) in Southern California, Xreal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/connecting-millions-of-apps-to-your-ar-glasses-xreal-launches-xreal-beam-pro-mobile-device-globally-at-awe-2024-302175517.html" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the Xreal Beam Pro. Priced at $200, this device turns Google Play Store apps into 3D experiences when used with Xreal&apos;s AR glasses.</p><p>The Beam Pro works with both the Xreal Air and Xreal Air 2, including the Pro and Ultra models. Just connect via USB-C to USB-C, and these AR glasses turn into powerful spatial computers, running on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with Xreal&apos;s own NebulaOS on top.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="sdxZ2rkWWm4mAGufapWQQd" name="Xreal-Beam-Pro-plus-Xreal-Air-2-Ultra.png" alt="Xreal Beam Pro plus AR glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sdxZ2rkWWm4mAGufapWQQd.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="750" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xreal notes that the Beam Pro is the first AR device to seamlessly connect with the Play Store, letting users explore and enjoy a vast array of content in 3D environments.</p><p>The device might look like a regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, but it&apos;s packed with features specifically for AR. Under the hood, it’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon spatial companion processor.</p><p>It also sports a 6.5-inch 2400 x 1080 LCD display with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate. You can choose between 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and it offers 128GB or 256GB of storage.</p><p>The Xreal Beam Pro is more than just a companion device. Its touchscreen serves as a control center, letting you manage the visuals in your Xreal glasses. Plus, it still works like a regular smartphone screen, allowing you to handle Play Store apps and change your settings with ease.</p><p>But it stands out from regular smartphones with its dedicated focus on AR. Unlike typical phones, it features dual 50MP cameras designed to capture 3D images and spatial videos. It also comes with dual USB-C ports, so you can charge the device and connect your Xreal glasses simultaneously.</p>

<p>The Beam Pro offers Wi-Fi 6 support and packs a 4300mAh battery. It will be available for a base price of $199, with shipments set to begin in mid-July.</p><p>Although future competition is uncertain, Xreal is on a mission to make AR accessible to everyone. The Beam Pro, with its affordable price, exemplifies this goal. This could be the tipping point that brings AR technology out of the niche market and into the mainstream.</p><p>That said, it&apos;s too soon to tell if intense competition is coming to the AR glasses market, but Xreal is clearly on a mission to make its augmented reality glasses accessible to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp is introducing a feature to set HD as the default upload quality for photos and videos.</li><li>Users no longer need to attach media as documents to avoid compression.</li><li>The feature is spotted in beta version 2.24.13.10 and expected to roll out globally soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is upping its game with a new default setting for sending high-quality photos and videos.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-hd-media-sharing-default-almost-ready/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">popular messaging app</a> is rolling out a new feature that lets you set "HD" as the default upload quality for photos and videos. This means you won&apos;t have to manually choose HD every time you share media, making high-quality sharing less of a hassle.</p><p>Previously, as an alternative, some users had to attach media as documents to avoid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>&apos;s compression. This clunky workaround added extra steps to what should have been a simple process.</p><p>The latest update eliminates the need for those workarounds, ensuring your precious moments are preserved in high quality. The company has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/hd-images-in-whatsapp">working on this capability for some time</a>, with Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-send-hd-photos">launching HD photo sharing last August</a>. Media files sent in this manner are marked by the HD label in the bottom left corner. Later, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-send-high-quality-videos">expanded the feature to include HD video sharing</a> as well.</p><p>Although HD isn&apos;t completely lossless, it&apos;s a big step up from WhatsApp&apos;s usual compression. That infamous compression often ruined image and video quality, turning memories into pixelated disasters. This update ensures your precious moments are shared with much better clarity.</p><p>Android Police noticed the new default setting in beta version 2.24.13.10 of WhatsApp. This suggests the feature will soon be available worldwide, moving beyond the testing phase.</p>

<p>To check if you already have access to it, go to the app&apos;s settings and then open <strong>Storage and data</strong> > <strong>Media upload quality</strong>.</p><p>This update is a mixed bag for WhatsApp users. While many will celebrate the crystal-clear quality of HD uploads, WhatsApp warns that these files use more bandwidth and storage space compared to standard options. However, for those who prioritize pristine photos and videos over saving data, the extra data use is a small price to pay.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve been using the Motorola Razr Plus as my daily driver for about a year now, pretty much since the device launched in June 2023. To say that this has been my favorite phone to use is quite an understatement. This phone was my first foray into foldables and made me fall in love with flip phones. I&apos;ve since reviewed plenty of other clamshells over the past year, but I always go back to the Motorola Razr Plus.</p><p>It&apos;s not Motorola&apos;s first foldable Razr since the moniker was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-razr-review">revitalized back in 2019</a>, but this was a huge leap forward for the company, essentially solidifying it in the foldable market with an impressive and well-designed phone. Its biggest selling point has been the massive cover screen, which is also the biggest reason why I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">chose the Razr Plus over the Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Now, more competitors are coming with larger cover screens, great cameras, and other compelling specs that could give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> a run for its money. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-foldables-june-launch-confirmed">the next Razr on its way</a> very soon, I want to look at how the current model has fared over the past year compared to when I first reviewed the phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3S8QFTpRzPa8aQLkLC4FqX" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-3.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3S8QFTpRzPa8aQLkLC4FqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"However, unlike its biggest competitor...the Razr Plus embraces curves, with the rear panel seamlessly flowing into the frame, which is also rounded. The result is a phone that&apos;s quite comfortable to hold, devoid of any sharp edges digging into my fingers."</strong></em></p>
<p>The phone&apos;s curvy design was one of my favorite things about it, and that remains true to this day. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">reviewing the Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, returning to the Razr Plus felt like a sweet relief to my hand, especially my poor pinky finger.</p><p>Overall, the phone is actually quite sturdy and has held up relatively well in the year I&apos;ve had it. Yeah, there are a few nicks here and there on the aluminum frame, and the power button/fingerprint sensor is starting to show its age, but everything still works as it should.</p><p>The hinge has also held up, but not as well as I would hope. Yes, the phone still opens and closes just like it should, and it even retains the very soft and satisfying sound when you shut it. However, open the display at just about any angle, and I notice it doesn&apos;t feel quite as sturdy as I remember. It even wobbles quite a bit, especially when I put my finger on it, and the effect is far more dramatic than what I&apos;ve seen on other flip phones like the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a>.</p><p>I can&apos;t say whether or not this is just a quirk with my particular unit, but I also sometimes hear a creaking sound when opening the phone. Not all the time, but when it does occur, I get a little concerned that the hinge is beginning to falter. It <em>should </em>be able to withstand up to 400,000 folds, although we&apos;ve seen one (rather extreme) case where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-folding-test">didn&apos;t quite reach that number</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>"Of the three color options, it&apos;s the only one with a faux leather back, adding a nice soft texture to the phone. I wouldn&apos;t say it feels premium, but it&apos;s definitely different from the all-glass or plain plastic phones I&apos;m used to."</strong></em></p><p>Motorola has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">leaning heavily on vegan leather</a> with its 2024 lineup, which is very nice to see on cheaper phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>. I will say that since reviewing the cheaper Razr, I find the finish on that phone feels a lot better, and I&apos;m curious to see how the next Razr will follow up. Still, the vegan leather finish is quite a nice touch on the Razr Plus and has probably saved me a few times after dropping the phone, although I&apos;d still recommend picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-and-razr-cases">Razr Plus 2023 case</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-and-razr-screen-protectors">screen protector</a> for the cover screen while you&apos;re at it.</p><p>Not all screen protectors and case combinations will work. I like the first-party Motorola cases, but the screen protector I was using would extend beyond the cover screen and onto the bezel above. Needless to say, this is a section already covered by the case, and using both at the same time just didn&apos;t work, so I had to choose which I would keep.</p>

<p><em><strong>"Aside from the faux leather back, the phone is quite glossy, which makes it look more crimson than magenta and reminds me of the red </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-g8-review"><em><strong>LG G8</strong></em></a><em><strong>. It&apos;s a beautiful phone that will surely stand out, especially if you can snag this colorway."</strong></em></p><p>The phone is still a head-turner and always gets looks whenever I use it in public. Plenty of strangers comment on it, saying how cool it looks and that it resembles a Game Boy Advance SP. I find that the people who are most in awe when they see the Razr Plus are iPhone users. Given the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in the iPhone space, that makes sense, but it&apos;s nice to see them appreciate the ingenuity of Android OEMs.</p>

<p><em><strong>"It&apos;s nearly a year old, but the [Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1] is still quite good and brings some solid performance to the Razr Plus."</strong></em></p><p>Motorola went with the slightly older Snapdragon chip in the Razr Plus, which is likely to keep costs down. This seemed very much like a smart move on Motorola&apos;s part, and performance has mostly remained consistently good with the chip. Obviously, the downside is that a year later, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</a> is now a generation and a half behind current flagship devices, and in the era of generative AI, it&apos;s starting to show its age.</p><p>Still, overall performance has held up well over the past year, although gaming can cause the phone to heat up quite a bit. Since the bottom half of the phone is vegan leather, only the top half—glass and aluminum—gets hot, which can be quite uncomfortable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uUghf2sg5tnb7i42XbVDfj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-7.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2023 internal display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uUghf2sg5tnb7i42XbVDfj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"I will say that the teardrop hinge mechanism on the Razr Plus seems to do wonders with the crease. It&apos;s not nonexistent — tilt the phone just right, and you&apos;ll definitely see it — but it&apos;s not as jarring as I expected it to be."</strong></em></p><p>The foldable display has not failed me in the year I&apos;ve used the phone. The crease is still extremely minimal, especially when compared to the Grand Canyon found on the Galaxy Z Flip 5. I will say that I&apos;ve started to notice very faint lines across the crease, which I imagine are stress fractures that have accumulated after flipping the phone open and shut for a year. I can&apos;t say I&apos;m particularly concerned about them, as they&apos;re very hard to see, and I can barely feel them with my finger, but it&apos;s worth noting if you&apos;re concerned about longevity and durability.</p><p>Dust and other particles will also accumulate in between the screen protector and the display bumper, which I don&apos;t really care for.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 doesn't have the best OLED display, and after some time, it starts to show its age.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The OLED display on the Razr Plus isn&apos;t the best-looking display I&apos;ve ever seen, especially since reviewing more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> over the past year. The display&apos;s Natural mode is too washed out, while the Vibrant mode is too vibrant for my liking. You can adjust the temperature, but this doesn&apos;t help too much. At one point, I tried to get it as close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> as I could, as it&apos;s a <em>much</em> better display, but nothing really worked.</p><p>Still, the 165Hz refresh rate is nice to have when viewing media and playing games, at least indoors or away from direct sunlight. I just wish peak brightness was brighter, as the display can be a little hard to see outdoors, which I believe is partly (or mostly) because of the built-in screen protector.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nb99u8YSDN3JzrJyMF9KhV" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-4.jpg" alt="YouTube Music on a rotated Motorola Razr Plus 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nb99u8YSDN3JzrJyMF9KhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"What I love about the cover screen is that it makes it incredibly easy to use the phone while closed."</strong></em></p><p>This has not changed, and it&apos;s the primary way I prefer to use the phone. The cover screen, while not as bright as I&apos;d like it to be, is still the most useful implementation of a flip phone external display that I&apos;ve come across. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a> feels like a wasted opportunity with the vertical cover display, and Samsung makes you go through too many hoops to allow access to your apps.</p><p>Since the phone launched, Motorola has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-razr-40-ultra-receives-update-that-enhances-the-user-experience/">updated the cover screen</a> with more functionality, allowing users to jump straight to the calendar, add more panel shortcuts, access more news stories, and more. My favorite addition is the ability to rotate the cover screen, which can be helpful when navigating certain apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, which enables a different UI in the Now Playing screen.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&apos;s still no option to adjust the resolution or refresh rate of the cover screen, which I feel could help reduce battery consumption.</p>

<p><em><strong>"The company promises to support the phone with three OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security updates, which is great for a phone that costs this much. Let&apos;s just hope Motorola can actually live up to the promise."</strong></em></p><p>As we all know, Motorola has not been the best when it comes to software updates. Things seem to have improved ever so slightly, but it still remains an issue if you&apos;re going to consider a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>. To its credit, the company has been pretty consistent in keeping a bi-monthly update cadence, which has been the case with the Razr Plus. Some of these updates have even included new UI tweaks and features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/experience-seamless-connectivity-with-smart-connect/">Smart Connect</a> (which is something of a Ready For rebrand).</p><p>Aside from that, many of the updates are small and just give the phone a security bump, usually with the previous month&apos;s patches. It&apos;s not phenomenal, but at least it&apos;s consistent.</p><p>The problem is with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. Most Android OEMs have rolled out the OS upgrade to all, if not most, of their devices by now. Meanwhile, the update has only appeared on a small handful of Motorola devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">Stylus 5G 2023</a>. The Razr Plus is somehow still without Android 14, which is a bit ridiculous at this point.</p><p>Stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is fast approaching, as the beta has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-3-platform-stability-rollout">just reached platform stability</a>. At this rate, the Razr Plus will receive Android 14 when other devices start getting Android 15, and it&apos;ll be yet another waiting game.</p><p>I&apos;ll also note that, for some reason, the Motorola Razr Plus still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-gemini-app-still-isnt-available-for-some-phones-why-not">doesn&apos;t have access to the Gemini app</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>"The phone struggles to get through an entire day on a single charge, despite Motorola&apos;s claims, so if you&apos;re a power user, be ready to charge the device at least once during the day and perhaps even twice within 24 hours."</strong></em></p><p>I can&apos;t say everyone has had the same experience as I have when it comes to battery life, but it&apos;s probably my biggest annoyance when it comes to the Razr Plus. Battery life has been consistently abysmal for me, and I won&apos;t even consider going out without making sure the phone is fully charged. And even then, I&apos;m still worried that it will die, so I try to make sure I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable charger</a> on me.</p><p>Battery anxiety like this should not happen in 2024.</p>

<p><em><strong>"Don&apos;t get me wrong...the Razr Plus doesn&apos;t take bad photos. It just doesn&apos;t take the best photos either, which, unfortunately, is par for the course when it comes to clamshell foldables."</strong></em></p><p>The cameras have been another weak point for me and is the main reason why I have often considered switching to the Galaxy Z Flip 5. This is also the reason why I normally carry two phones around with me (usually a Pixel), so that I can at least get some decent shots wherever I&apos;m at. The Razr Plus camera is just unreliable.</p><p>Motorola surprised me with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-is-making-photo-editing-effortless-with-auto-enhance-from-google-photos/">update</a> that addressed this. The phone now has an option to apply AI-based Auto Enhance via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, which happens automatically when you take a photo. This gives photos a welcome boost, and you can always toggle it off in the viewfinder if you need to. That said, it still doesn&apos;t do enough for me to rely on this phone&apos;s image quality, especially when taking selfies.</p>

<p>So, how has the Motorola Razr Plus held up in the year that I&apos;ve used it? Well, it&apos;s a bit of a mixed bag. I still love this phone enough to keep it as my daily driver, and I will boast loudly and proudly when people ask me about it. The cover screen experience is still the best, and I still enjoy the versatility of a flip phone. Plus, Motorola still has some things going for it, like its useful gestures and powerful Smart Connect.</p><p>However, my biggest gripes with the phone still remain. Atrocious battery life and cameras that are okay at best can sometimes ruin the overall experience. For some of you, I can see how these points would deter you from buying the phone.</p><p>To counter that, this is a phone that cost $999 when it launched and has since seen some incredible discounts. Now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/who-needs-prime-day-the-motorola-razr-plus-has-already-crashed-to-its-lowest-price-ever">buy the Motorola Razr Plus for as low as $650</a>, which is about what you&apos;d pay for a standard midrange phone and is even cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. For that price, I think the negatives can be overlooked, just as long as you&apos;re willing to work a bit for a good photo and carry a portable charger around with you.</p><p>Or, you can wait to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which will hopefully have addressed many of the problems I&apos;ve had with its predecessor.</p>

<p>Google relaunched the Find My Device network to compete with Apple&apos;s similar item-finding Find My network, with the official roll-out going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">live in April 2024</a>. The idea behind this was to create a web of compatible devices around the world to help you find lost stuff using compatible item trackers.</p><p>This is right up my alley as a professional accessory fiddler, which is why I got my hands on the latest and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">greatest Bluetooth trackers</a> that support the new network. Chipolo and Pebblebee were the first brands to jump on the Find My Device train, so those are the brands I chose for my little experiment.</p><p>We&apos;ve all heard that Google&apos;s Find My Device network is live, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">it isn&apos;t working as expected</a>. Still, I was really hoping that my test would yield positive results to a certain extent. Here&apos;s how it went down.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="SRB5UNuckEYD6iUD7vE58U" name="google-find-my-device-network-trackers-pebblebee-chipolo-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="Various Google Find My Device Bluetooth trackers from Chipolo and Pebblebee held in one hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SRB5UNuckEYD6iUD7vE58U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2556" height="1438" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pebblebee was kind enough to send me the Pebblebee Clip for Android, Pebblebee Card for Android, and Pebblebee Tag for Android. Here are the basic specs of the three Bluetooth trackers.</p>

<p>To get a fair understanding of the network, I also reached out to Chipolo for their Google Find My Device compatible trackers. The brand just launched updated versions of its older lineup. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-one-bluetooth-tracker-review">Chipolo ONE Point</a> and the Chipolo CARD Point have been revamped to support Google&apos;s new network.</p>

<p>Both brands offer your typical circular trackers with keyholes as well as card-shaped ones. In addition to these, Pebblebee offers a tiny tag that comes with a silicone mold and double-sided adhesive tape. You can either attach the tag to your pet&apos;s collar using the silicone holder or use the sticky tape to attach it to something like a TV remote.</p><p>In essence, Pebblebee and Chipolo&apos;s Find My Device trackers are nearly identical in terms of functionality. You set each tracker up using your Android phone and each brand&apos;s respective <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android app</a>. The app automatically helps you add your tracker to the Google Find My Device app.</p><p>I found Chipolo&apos;s app to be a tad faster while setting up new trackers. Meanwhile, Pebblebee&apos;s trackers have better response and a wider Bluetooth range. Bear in mind that Chipolo&apos;s trackers are louder than Pebblebee&apos;s. They all sport splash-proof water resistance across the board.</p><p>What&apos;s really cool is that Pebblebee&apos;s trackers are rechargeable using plain old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> or magnetic-pin-to-USB-C cables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3531px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="V5FH6M5hinMGoe6h9tFuMK" name="Pebblebee-Clip-google-find-my-device-tracker-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Pebblebee Clip for Android compatible with the Google Find My Device network, attached to a car key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V5FH6M5hinMGoe6h9tFuMK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3531" height="1986" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After setting up the Google Find My Device trackers, you name and attach them to things that matter. What I ended up doing with all five of my trackers was dividing each one among my friends and asking them not to disclose their location to me. I wanted to locate them randomly using the power of Google&apos;s network, and my friends could then confirm whether the network was correct or not.</p><p>Everything worked out fine and dandy while the trackers were within my phone&apos;s Bluetooth range. However, the minute I was out of range, the network lost them immediately. At this point, I decided it was time to turn things up a notch.</p><p>The next day, I marked all Bluetooth trackers as lost. Surely, at least one of the five trackers would be found over the next few days? Shockingly, three whole days passed before I heard anything back.</p><p>And get this: it wasn&apos;t even the network that helped me find my "lost" trackers. I happened to have dinner with my friends and had forgotten that some of them were carrying my trackers. Midway through my meal, a notification on my phone alerted me that one of my lost trackers was found and was nearby.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="rXEnfLMRkn3xTMDSLvpx2T" name="google-find-my-device-app-screenshots.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device network app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rXEnfLMRkn3xTMDSLvpx2T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was under the impression that the network would work spectacularly well, seeing as how Android devices are massively popular in the Asian region where I am based.</p><p>Going off of my expectations versus reality, I soon realized that the presence of Android devices is not enough for the Find My Device network to be successful. My colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">Brady Snyder did a fine job explaining this</a>.</p><p>Although the majority of all Android and Google Fast Pair devices can use Google&apos;s new network, not many choose to contribute to the crowdsourcing network. Limited contribution and participation are killing what could be a fantastic anonymous way of item tracking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="VJLvbMZRiqnjQcBntwG6P5" name="google-find-my-device-app-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device network app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJLvbMZRiqnjQcBntwG6P5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ironically, Google offers too many options for participating in the Find My Device network. This was designed to protect user privacy, so I can&apos;t really fault them for that, but it doesn&apos;t really make sense, seeing as how device location data contributions are anonymous and encrypted.</p><p>Apart from this confusing variety of options to contribute to the network, there&apos;s also the fact that a lot of people simply haven&apos;t set up the Find My Device feature on their Android devices yet. It&apos;s not on everyone&apos;s list of first things to do with their new Android phone, and some people don&apos;t even know about the feature, which is a whole other problem.</p><p>So, what can be done to fix this? As controversial as it might sound, Google needs to find a way to make more Android users contribute to its crowdsourcing network if its Find My Device network is going to reach its full potential. If people choose not to be part of the network, it will fail as an item-finding network by design. And with that in mind, there will be no point in upgrading your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a> to the latest variants either. Since contributions to the crowdfunded Find My Device network are anonymous anyway, why give people so many chances to opt out of its more useful feature?</p>

<hr>
<p>Last week, Google finally addressed a critical security flaw that researchers and security advocates have been raising awareness of since April. The problem? Google included the fix in the June Pixel Feature Drop, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> aren&apos;t able to receive the update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-patches-exploited-android-zero-day-on-pixel-devices/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a> first reported the patch, and the team at GrapheneOS — who first reported the vulnerability — confirmed that non-Pixel devices will need to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to get a fix.</p><p>Google patched 50 security vulnerabilities in the Android 14 QPR3 update for Pixels. However, one stands out because it is a zero-day vulnerability. This means that the flaw was actively exploited in the wild before Google became aware of it. Zero-day security vulnerabilities are the most severe, and thus, Google recommends that all Pixel users apply the June update as soon as possible. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's fixed on Pixels with the June update (Android 14 QPR3) and will be fixed on other Android devices when they eventually update to Android 15. If they don't update to Android 15, they probably won't get the fix, since it has not been backported. Not all patches are backported.<a href="https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1801294252925927728">June 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The company shared this information on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2024-06-01" target="_blank">Pixel Update Bulletin</a>, which is where Google provides updates on security problems affecting Pixel devices or Android. "There are indications that CVE-2024-32896 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," the company explains. According to GrapheneOS, the actively-exploited CVE-2024-32896 refers to the same exploit that was previously reported as CVE-2024-29748. The new identifier represents the Pixel-exclusive fix that was included in the June update. </p><p>The issue is an elevation of privilege (EoP) problem with Android firmware that Google referred to as of "high severity" for Pixels. </p><p>"It was exploited by forensics companies against users with apps like Wasted and Sentry trying to wipe the device when detecting an attack," the GrapheneOS team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1801294115407106186">explained</a>. "We addressed it as part of making our duress PIN/password feature and reported it to get Google to fix it across Android, which is now done." </p><p>The developers add that two core problems are making the exploit possible. The first is system memory not being erased when entering fast boot mode, meaning that it&apos;s possible for an exploit to access older system memory. A separate but related issue centers around the Android Open Source Project device admin API needing reboot-to-recovery to erase — though this has been fixed in Android 14 QPR3.</p><p>The first problem was previously fixed on Pixels, and the second was fixed in the June Pixel Feature Drop. However, as we&apos;ve mentioned, Pixel phones and tablets are the only ones that receive the fix. That&apos;s because of the way that Android OEMs release software updates and fixes, and it isn&apos;t entirely Google&apos;s fault. </p>

<p>Considering that this issue was actively exploited and has a high severity, you&apos;re probably wondering why other Android devices aren&apos;t getting a fix. After all, Google is advising Pixel users to update their devices ASAP to protect themselves. The truth is that Google has done its part, and it&apos;s up to the other OEMs to implement a fix. The company included the patch in Android 14 QPR3, and any device that receives the Android 14 QPR3 update will get it. </p><p>Fixes like this one are often added to the Android Open Source Project, or AOSP, which serves as the basis for other versions of Android. An operating system like Samsung&apos;s One UI or OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS uses AOSP as the groundwork. The issue is that third-party operating systems usually apply AOSP upgrades yearly. So, Samsung will likely use the AOSP version of Android 15 as the basis for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">One UI 7</a>. However, a future version of Android 15 QPR2 or Android 15 QPR3 wouldn&apos;t impact Samsung Galaxy devices until One UI 8. </p><p>In other words, the reason Google Pixel devices are the only ones to get this patch are because they&apos;re the only ones to receive monthly, quarterly, and yearly updates. Theoretically, a company could take the fix included in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2-2">Android 14 QPR3</a> and apply it to their phones. However, since other OEMs don&apos;t do quarterly updates, the security patches included in Android 14 QPR3 won&apos;t hit their devices until Android 15. </p><p>Some security patches are seeded to older versions of Android through a process called backporting. This doesn&apos;t happen for every patch, though. Google probably should have backported the fix for this security flaw, keeping in mind the severity and its zero-day status. However, it&apos;s not necessarily Google&apos;s responsibility to do so. Additionally, only half of the security issues are related to AOSP. No one can solve the first issue described above except each manufacturer itself. </p><p>This is the latest example of how choosing an Android phone from a brand other than Google can put a user at a security risk. Other brands are too slow to respond to critical zero-day flaws with patches, and it&apos;s a real problem. Sometimes, the blame lies with Google and others with the partner OEMs, and it&apos;s often a mix of both. Either way, the users suffer.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Ice Universe has shared some exciting details about the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim.</li><li>It is a thinner, lighter, and bigger alternative to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, launching in China as Galaxy W25.</li><li>The tipster indicates that the slimmer Galaxy foldable will launch in October, and not at the upcoming July Unpacked event.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s anticipated Galaxy Unpacked event is only a couple of weeks away. We should see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 next to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 during the launch event. Several rumors have been regarding another Galaxy Z Fold 6 model over the past few months; however, new information indicates it is likely to launch in October. </p><p>The device in question is the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, another foldable device from Samsung. Well-known leaker Ice Universe on X has shared some interesting details about the foldable of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim. As the name suggests, it will be thinner, lighter, and larger than the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 and will be renamed Galaxy W25 in China, notes Ice Universe. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Z Fold6 Slim will be named Samsung W25 in China, which is lighter, thinner and larger than Fold6.Will be released in October and does not support SPen.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1803016380838551887">June 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The tipster further indicates that it will be launched in October, although it didn&apos;t specify whether it is for the Chinese market or other regions. Also, it will be missing an important feature, which is the support for S-Pen, unlike the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> that support it.</p><p>In the accompanying interactions with the comments on the aforementioned X post, Ice Universe has shared that it wouldn&apos;t be some kind of Fan Edition device. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will also have a solid build, as it utilizes the premium titanium frame.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim details are still scarce, although this isn&apos;t the first time we have heard about it. Late last month, prominent display analyst Ross Young <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-fold-6-slim-expected-to-launch-in-2025">shared details</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, which slightly differ from today&apos;s Ice Universe claims.</p><p>While Young also hinted that the Z Fold 6 Slim will have a bigger display than the original Z Fold 6 next to no S-Pen support, he noted that the alleged device won&apos;t launch until next year, as its display panel will be shipping in the fourth quarter of this year. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-stick-to-two-galaxy-foldables-as-before">latest report</a> from South Korea claimed that Samsung is sticking with the same two foldables this year, citing a lack of differentiation factors.</p><p>While it will be encouraging to have more foldables phone options from Samsung to consider next to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>, rumors regarding the Z Fold 6 Slim are becoming speculative at this point. </p><p>Given the tipster&apos;s solid credibility, if the prediction regarding the new Slim foldable phone is accurate, it would be an interesting option to look forward to, even if it likely turns out to be a pricer.</p>
