<p>Last July, I discovered I&apos;d hit 225 pounds—close to "obese" for my height—having gained over 20 pounds in three years. After that, I decided to change my lifestyle to return back to my pre-COVID weight, but I ended up dipping even further, as I&apos;m currently at 192 pounds. And all my weight loss came without using a strict diet or nutrition apps but instead with the help of some useful tech items.</p><p>My weight gain snuck up on me. I ran consistently throughout my 20s and early 30s, and a walk-heavy lifestyle in Boston and New York City kept my body pretty healthy. I was never conscious of grown-up concepts like restrained eating, even as my metabolism slowed, my pace fell by minutes per mile, and my belly and love handles steadily grew.</p><p>The pandemic and this sedentary writing job were the tipping points, but I didn&apos;t realize it. I kept increasing my running mileage, finishing two (really slow) marathons in 2022 with the assumption that my effort would pay off in lost weight. Instead, the running did little to help, and the extra pounds led to a foot injury in spring 2023.</p><p>That was the catalyst for my weight loss efforts, and I treated July 2023 as a mid-year resolution moment to change things. One year later, it&apos;s paid off! So, for anyone else currently in a bit of a weight-loss slump, I thought I&apos;d share my strategy for the tech tools I used to keep myself on track—and why I didn&apos;t need dieting apps to change my eating outlook.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: I&apos;m not a weight loss expert or nutritionist. I&apos;m simply showing a solution I found for myself, and I hope (but can&apos;t guarantee) it will work for others.</em></p>
<h2 id="a-scale-with-body-composition-data-2">A scale with body composition data</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wCMqQ3jdt7WU53n7cryAu" name="Withings-Body-Smart-eyes-closed.jpeg" alt="A 15-pound scale sits on the Withings Body Smart.

<p>First, you need a tool to track your progress. I&apos;m no expert on smart scales, but I like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/withings-body-smart-review">Withings Body Smart</a> for tracking body fat, muscle, visceral fat, basal metabolic rate, hydration, and a few other metrics. It also has an "Eyes Closed" weigh-in mode, but I learned not to let a higher weight disappoint me.</p><p>My strategy was to weigh myself consistently two times a week on Wed/Thurs and Sat/Sun. Weighing daily puts too much obsessive emphasis on everything you do in a given day. But weighing once a week leaves you without context for whether that data is accurate or just a fluke.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I mean: Since the start of 2024, I&apos;ve lost 12 pounds. But across all weigh-ins, my weight dipped 26 times, rose 18 times, and evened out twice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HcgQ2LG78CyVQpLtzuYWX4" name="withings-weight-charts.jpg" alt="Withings app screenshots showing the author's weight-loss progress from 2023 to 2024.

<p>Sometimes, I gained or lost weight solely based on muscle gain or hydration, while my body fat stayed the same. More often, I&apos;d lose body fat after a hard workout, and then my body would naturally add some fat back over the next few days. </p><p>I trended downwards from 25% to 19% body fat, but frequent weigh-ins helped me see how my body naturally fluctuates and helped me not get too depressed (or overly optimistic) because of one data point. So long as you&apos;re confident in your fitness and nutrition strategy, things should pay off in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="any-smartwatch-it-apos-s-all-about-the-steps-2">Any smartwatch (it&apos;s all about the steps)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-on-shoes.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965, which is sitting on top of a pair of shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Strava, I ran 234 miles in 2021, 419 miles in 2022, and 674 miles in 2023. Most people would assume the extra mileage helped me lose weight; instead, I <em>gained</em> weight even as I ran more often. I&apos;m sure every mile had a brief impact, but high-heart-rate runs burn calories, not fat, and then your body demands you replace those calories.</p><p>My first major month of weight loss was August 2023, when I walked over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">10,000 steps a day for a month</a>, or 374,000 in total, using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> to track steps. It was an extremely <em>boring</em> experiment, as I had to find ways to entertain myself for 60–90 minutes of power walking every night. However, it also helped me lose 9 pounds that month.</p><p>Why did it work? For starters, fast walking falls into the low aerobic workout category—55–75% of your maximum heart rate—that burns fat instead of carbs. More importantly, daily walks carved out about 1.5–2 hours of my day for walking, showering, and filling up on water that might normally have been spent sitting and snacking. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-step-test-with-Fitbit-Charge-6-and-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer held in hand with the number 5,000, a Garmin Forerunner 165 (5,062 steps), and a Fitbit Charge 6 (4,812 steps)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Find a smartwatch that gives you an accurate step count. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For people with a sedentary lifestyle and a lot of weight to carry, long walks are both a mental distraction from cravings and a low-impact physical activity, one that won&apos;t leave you too tired to exercise the next day. Just buy some good running shoes with cushy insoles to protect your feet before you start, and pick out podcasts or audiobooks to fill the hours.</p><p>Since August, I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve walked <em>every</em> day. I have way too many books to read and video games to play. But the count for my average daily steps since July 2023 is 7,829; from July 2022 to 2023, it was only 5,100, most of which came from sporadic runs. This year&apos;s fat-burning walks have made a real weight loss difference, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">hilly hikes</a>.</p><p>My Garmin Forerunner 965 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">most accurate watch for step counting</a>, but its price and features are overkill for walkers and hikers. You can technically use Google Fit or Apple Health on your phone to track steps, but phones aren&apos;t always the most accurate, and it&apos;s nice to track walking activities to check mileage and heart rate, not just steps. So I recommend any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> or fitness trackers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-google-doc-yes-really-2">A Google Doc (yes, really)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1227px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RFuESZEhjJzGvUap6iinoH" name="Google-doc-workout-log.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of my Google Doc for 2024 workout and weight loss resolutions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RFuESZEhjJzGvUap6iinoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1227" height="690" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My laptop&apos;s Chrome browser has two tabs I never close: My Gmail and my "2024 Resolutions" document. On the latter, I track my monthly miles run, miles walked or hiked, steps, exercises like push-ups and squats, and a bunch of other fitness (and non-fitness) stuff. I took a quick screenshot above to show where and how I log my information. </p><p>You can probably find hundreds of fitness log mobile apps, each with detailed graphs and motivational tools that challenge you to hit daily goals and subtly make you feel bad if you "slack off" or lose a daily streak. But these don&apos;t work for me and likely won&apos;t work for busy people with jobs or kids that&apos;ll derail your best-laid plans for days, weeks, or even months.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint. Monthly targets matter more than daily streaks for busy people.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint. If you&apos;re motivated to hit monthly goals, it doesn&apos;t matter if you fall behind for a few days, so long as you try to make up lost ground in free moments or bounce back the next month. </p><p>When I fell off my walking goals in February because of the cold, I consigned that lazy month to a single orange "fail" box and then rebounded, surpassing my goals in March. I never let a setback demoralize me enough to give up entirely because the Google Doc shows how many more chances I have to hit my goals this year.</p><p>Having all that data on hand at a glance—and having a low-maintenance way to update your progress with a few keystrokes—is preferable to a convoluted fitness app that you can <em>choose not to open</em> to avoid guilty feelings. You can glance at your resolutions doc at any time to celebrate your progress or challenge yourself to make up lost ground that evening. And you&apos;ll never quit on yourself.</p>
<h2 id="no-nutrition-apps-required-2">No nutrition apps required</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KpsYD7Wcf9GWtakbHqtR3f" name="Fitbit-Premium-Wellness-Reports.jpeg" alt="Fitbit Premium Wellness Report summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KpsYD7Wcf9GWtakbHqtR3f.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know plenty of people who went on strict diets to lose weight, counting every calorie and weighing their food for nutrition apps. And with no exceptions, those people fell off their diets and apps because (A) they&apos;re so much work to track and (B) they have you fixating on the impact of every single meal until the pressure and cravings escalate and you end up binge-eating.</p><p>My approach has nothing to do with eating exactly 2,000 calories (or less to lose weight) and everything to do with <em>moderation</em>. I want to lose this weight and then keep it off, and I know myself. I&apos;m not going to give up on sugar, snacks, or the occasional beer for the rest of my life, so I had to find the balance of indulging myself without going too far.</p><p>I kept things simple. I used to buy myself gummy worms (800 calories a bag) and eat them in one sitting, so I switched to buying bags or bars in the 250–400 calorie range. I used to buy bags of goldfish (840 calories) and scarf them down at my desk over a day; I knew that I couldn&apos;t just <em>stop</em> myself halfway, so I switched to Ritz peanut butter sandwich packs (200 calories) that naturally cut me off.</p><p>I inhale high-calorie snacks like crackers and chips because they don&apos;t <em>feel</em> filling, so I switched to dense snacks like bagels or protein bars that proportionally fill my stomach.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don't trust myself with a full pantry of snacks, but I do trust myself to know how much food is too much without a calculator. You do too.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>With alcohol, I usually like to have a couple of drinks to enjoy a buzz without overdoing it, but I&apos;d realized that a "beer gut" was a real thing. So rather than cut back my number of drinks per sitting, I cut back the number of <em>days</em> I drank, saving it for once or twice a week instead of every couple of days.</p><p>Takeout food is calorie-rich and salty, causing your body to retain water. But as much as I&apos;d love to cook every day, I&apos;m not going to, especially if I&apos;m spending hours a day walking or running. So, I simply curtailed the number of times I ordered out per month.</p><p>I can keep going, but my overall point is that weight loss doesn&apos;t need to be calculative, just relative and contextual. I know that I have bad impulse control with foods that come in large containers, so I buy snack-sized options that are more expensive but less dangerous. Then, when I&apos;m home, I freely enjoy the foods I bought for myself without guilt.</p><p>So long as I&apos;m eating less than my past self, I know it&apos;ll pay off eventually, and I&apos;ll still enjoy Five Guys and Ben & Jerry&apos;s in the long term.</p>
<h2 id="keep-it-simple-2">Keep it simple!</h2>
<p>Here&apos;s the TL;DR: I lost 30 pounds by walking an extra couple of miles per day, using tech like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-scales-for-tracking-weight-loss">smart scales</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> to track my activities and weight trends, focusing on common-sense portion control with food and drinks, and logging my progress in a Google Doc where I prioritize monthly goals over daily activity rings. It&apos;s uncomplicated, and that&apos;s why it worked for me.</p><p>These were my monthly changes in pounds since July 2023: -1.6, -9, -4, -4.5, -0.2, +0.6, -5.1, -2.6, -2, +1.2, -0.6, -2.9. After my initial weight free-fall, things have stabilized, and I&apos;ll have months where I&apos;m too sedentary or snacky to make significant progress. But I have confidence in myself that things will stay on track and I&apos;ll find the time to get walking again, especially in the summer months when the sun&apos;s out past 8 p.m.</p><p>My weight loss advice is simple: Carve out time in your schedule to walk, with or without company, and write down your progress somewhere to keep yourself honest. Don&apos;t trust yourself to deprive yourself of delicious food for the rest of your life; instead, try to find ways to eat less than you did yesterday while still enjoying those guilty pleasures in moderation.</p>

<p>When you first look at these two models, you might not see much difference in design. But with a closer look, you&apos;ll see that the Motorola Razr 2024 comes in various colors, such as Spritz Orange, Beach Sand, and Koala Grey.

Motorola also adds Corning Gorilla Glass Victus on the front for better protection and a hinge that&apos;s 30% smaller than last year with an IPX8 rating. The smaller hinge is that the screen crease is reduced but not eliminated in its 6000 series high-strength aluminum frame.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 is available in Infinite Black, Glacier Blue, Viva Magenta, and Peach Fuzz. It also has a vegan leather option for that premium finish. It weighs the same (188g) as the newer standard model and has better dust protection with an IP52 rating.

<p>There are notable differences in hardware between the Motorola Razr 2024 and the Razr Plus 2023. For example, the newer Moto features a 4,200mAh battery, 30W Turbo Power, and 15W wireless charging. In terms of processors, you&apos;ll find a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a> that offers four Arm Cortex-A78 cores clocking at 2.5GHz.</p><p>If you like taking pictures, try the Razr 2024&apos;s 50MP (OIS) primary camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera. For selfies, you can have fun with the 32MP lens, which has features like Gesture and Auto Smile Capture, Face Beauty, and Google Photos Auto Enhance. You get crispt 4K (30fps) FHD videos with the primary camera and 4K UHD (30fps) with the front-facing camera. You can also count on 256GB storage, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and a USB-C port.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 has a 3,800mAh battery and supports 30W TurboPower wired and slower 5W wireless charging. So, if you want faster charging, it&apos;s best to plug in. Regarding the battery, our reviewer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Derrek Lee mentions</a> that the battery life isn&apos;t great, and the phone struggles to get through the day on a single charge. Last year&apos;s Razr Plus 2023 was powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</a>, which offers the same benefits as the 8 Gen 1 but with better thermal management. The processor should be enough for everything you might do with the phone, such as using your favorite apps, using the apps, and having the apps switch between the two displays.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2023 also has stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and three mics that produce pleasant audio, along with 256GB storage with no expandable storage. Other specifications include a USB 2.0 Type-C port and Qualcomm Snapdragon Sound.</p>

<p>You can use your favorite Samsung Galaxy Watch bands with the Galaxy Watch FE, giving you a wider selection to choose from. Bands that measure 20mm and are compatible with the Galaxy Watch 6, Watch 5, and even the Watch 4 fit the Watch FE perfectly. This includes the fancy new one-click connector band that Samsung launched last year.</p><p>If you want something unique that doesn&apos;t look like every other metal band, we highly recommend the LETOID 20mm Band for your Galaxy Watch FE. This stainless steel band is super easy to adjust thanks to its magnetic loop, no mucking around with a tool to open links. It&apos;s not expensive and the two color options are bound to look good with at least 60% of your closet.</p><p>For those who want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-first-party-samsung-galaxy-watch-5-and-5-pro-bands">first-party picks</a>, or perhaps you want something extremely comfortable, we suggest the Samsung Galaxy Watch Sport T-Buckle Band.

To top it off, this first-party Samsung band comes with the one-click connector that debuted with the Galaxy Watch 6 series.

<p>The Motorola Razr 2023 has a 1.6-inch external display and 5W of wireless charging but comes with a higher 2,640 x 1,080 resolution and a 64MP primary camera compared to the 50MP on the newer model. The battery can get you through your day thanks to the 4,200mAh cell.</p></p>

<p>An initial Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Razr 2023 comparison shows that changes to the newer model could entice you to upgrade by simply looking at the external display. With a more prominent display, you can do more without opening your phone. Fortunately, Motorola has finally made the changes many users sought.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch">Motorola Razr 2024</a> is available along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Razr Plus 2024</a>, but if you want to keep things simple, you must compare the two models to see which one is best for you. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheaper Android phone</a> may not have all the perks you would find on the Plus model, but it still has a lot to offer. Let&apos;s break down what both models offer to see if you stay with the older model.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2024-vs-razr-2023-design-2">Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Razr 2023: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECcHDoko6rUYJSdC8YhVAj" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-and-Razr-2023-1.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 next to the Razr 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECcHDoko6rUYJSdC8YhVAj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The two Motorola Razr models are virtually identical in dimensions: 6.7 x 2.9 x 0.29 inches (open) and 3.5 x 2.9 x 0.62 inches (closed). Both models also share the vegan leather look and have Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, but they have different color options.</p><p>Not everything is the same in the Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Razr 2023 scenario since the 2023 model has an IP52 rating. This means that it is almost dust-tight but will suffer water damage with a water-resistance rating of 2, so the device is only protected against water dripping at an angle of 15 degrees. The older Motorola also has a tiny external display that is only good for reading notifications and forces you to open your phone to do anything else.</p><p>It also features various features from the Plus model, such as the aluminum chassis and hinge. You can turn on the mobile hotspot display from the cover screen, something you can&apos;t do on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-deals">Samsung Galaxy Flip 5</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, the newer Motorola Razr 2024 has an improved IPX8 rating, making it water-resistant up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. However, it does not have a rating for dust resistance, which doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it does have one, but Motorola didn&apos;t put it through testing. The external display, however, is a game changer for the newer Motorola since it features a more prominent display that allows you to use various apps without opening your phone. The color options for this model include Beach Sand, Koala Grey, and Spritz Orange.</p><p>The Razr 2024&apos;s hinge is 30% smaller than last year&apos;s model, resulting in a less noticeable crease on the screen. We&apos;ll discuss the display in more detail in the following section.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3725px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-1.jpg" alt="The Razr 2023 on a pile of leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3725" height="2095" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The size of the 6.9-inch, 2640 x 1080, pOLED resolution inner display remains the same for both models.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 has an improved peak brightness of 3,000 nits for the inner display (120Hz refresh rate) and 1,700 for the external display. You can also count on the Water Touch technology, which allows your phone to understand your input while standing out in the rain correctly—the exact feature you would find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> smartphone. You also enjoy display features such as Attentive Display, which helps keep your screen on while looking at it.</p><p>The external display gives way to a 3.6-inch flexible AMOLED screen with a 1056 x 1066 resolution, 90Hz refresh rate, and 120Hz touch rate. There is also a dedicated Spotify panel to control your playlist and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/listen-up-the-bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-are-dollar130-off-at-best-buy-right-now">Bose</a> panel. If you decide to use the rear cameras, your friends can preview the picture you&apos;re taking.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2023 has a strip on an external display that is 1.5 inches in size and can be used as a viewfinder for selfies. You cannot do much in the external display due to its small size, but it&apos;s not entirely useless since you can easily swipe to view different notifications. The brightness on the Razr 2023 is less than the newer model, with a peak brightness of 1,400 nits for the internal display and 1,00 for the external OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed regarding battery life since the 2024 and 2023 Razr models share a 4,200mAh battery, giving you about 10 hours of usage and 30W wired charging. They also share 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM, Dual Atmos featuring Spatial Sound, and three microphones.</p><p>The hardware difference between the two Motorola phones is that the Motorola Razr 2024 comes with 15W wireless charging and a MediaTek Dimensity 7300X, which gives smooth performance for an upper mid-range processor. The newer model only offers 256 GB storage and no expandable storage option. The camera specification has changed since the newer Motorola drops to a 50MP primary camera with a 12.6 ultrawide (no telephoto) camera on the rear.</p><p>The sensor on the newer model will give you a fingerprint reader, proximity and light sensor, ambient light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, eCompass, hall sensor, and barometer.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2023 has a lower wireless charging speed of 5W but makes up for it with a 64MP primary camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera. It also has a Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor but no headphone jack. The older Motorola has the same sensors but with the Ultra-Sonic sensor to add.</p>

<p>Both models will get three years of Android updates and four years of security support.</p><p>If you want Android 14 with Hello UX (latest UI), the Motorola Razr 2024 might sound more appealing. The Hello UX brings features such as Ready For connectivity to connect your smartphone to a PC. The newer model isn&apos;t packed with many AI features you would find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Razr Plus 2024 model</a>, but it does come with some room for Google&apos;s Gemini Nano. You can access the feature from the cover screen by long pressing the power button.</p><p>You can also enjoy Moto AI features such as " Catch me up," which summarizes your notifications. There is also "Pay attention," which launches recording features. If you need to save something on your screen, you can use the " Remember this" feature.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2023 comes with Android 14 and My UX (older UI) out of the box. You won&apos;t find a long list of AI features since this model came out before companies added all those fun features to their phones. The older UI is more limited when it comes to customization.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 will be available on T-Mobile on July 10 and on Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola on July 24. You can also find the latest Motorola on Consumer Cellular and Xfinity Mobile on July 24. The Razr 2024 will go on sale for $699, while you can currently get the 2023 version for $449 unlocked at Amazon.</p><p>The bigger external screen and all the AI features found on the Razr 2024 make it a huge reason to upgrade. You can do so much more on the bigger screen, the newer UI, and all the AI features that come with the new model. The upgrade is a good idea if you like the idea of doing more with the external display.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Big improvements </strong></em></p>
<p>The new Motorola Razr Plus 2024 might not look all that different from the 2023 model, but there are plenty of upgrades that make it a much better product. It's a little heavier due to the larger battery, but the in-hand feel has improved thanks to the new materials and textures. It has a flagship-grade processor, a smaller hinge, higher-resolution cameras, and brighter displays. The cover display is one of the largest you'll find, letting you perform most routine tasks without opening the phone. The slick software with Moto AI smarts completes the great user experience.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 is a big upgrade over its predecessor as Samsung finally bit the bullet and gave it a large and useful cover screen. It also has a striking design, decent cameras, great software with Galaxy AI tricks, and a 2023 flagship Qualcomm processor. Like the Razr Plus 2024, it too lacks any official dust protection rating, and we found the battery life to be just about okay. The cover display, while larger than before, is still limited in terms of functionality. The Z Flip 5 is still the foldable to beat thanks to its wide availability and timely software updates.</p></p>

<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> (also known as Razr 50 Ultra in some markets) has roughly the same dimensions as the 2023 model. The frame uses 6000 series high-strength aluminum and has a thickness of 7.09mm when open and 15.32mm when closed. The weight has gone up a bit to 189g and we noticed this when compared to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">predecessor</a>.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 comes in a fun and wide <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">range of colors</a> like Midnight Blue, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, and Hot Pink. Fingerprints are not an issue with this one thanks to vegan leather back panels for all the colors. Interestingly, each one has a slightly different texture.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a slightly slimmer aluminum frame so it&apos;s marginally sleeker when folded or unfolded. It&apos;s a tiny bit lighter too at 187g, but this difference is barely noticeable. It also comes in a wide range of colors with certain shades being exclusive to some regions. In the U.S., it&apos;s available in Graphite, Lavender, Cream, and Mint.</p>

<p>Motorola has always been ahead of the game with the displays on its foldables, and the new Razr Plus 2024 raises the bar yet again. The outer display is now a massive 4 inches with much slimmer bezels all around. This pOLED panel has a crisp 1,272x1,080 resolution with a 165Hz refresh rate, which is crazy good for a secondary display.</p><p>Thankfully, it&apos;s now an LTPO-type OLED which means the refresh rate can dynamically scale down to double or single-digit frequencies in order to conserve battery. The display is also brighter with 2,400 nits of peak brightness, has Gorilla Glass Victus protection, and HDR10+.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> has a comparatively smaller 3.4-inch Super AMOLED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and a lower 720x748 resolution. The maximum rated peak brightness is also lower at 1,600 nits. Despite that, we didn&apos;t face any issues viewing content on the outer display even in daylight. The display is also oddly shaped, like a folder, and it doesn&apos;t wrap around the cameras the way the Razr Plus display does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-03.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 main display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The primary folding display on the Z Flip 5 is a bright and vivid 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x panel with a 2,640x1,080 resolution and a 22:9 aspect ratio. The peak brightness has been bumped up from its predecessor up to 1,750 nits. This folding display is of the LTPO variety, with a variable refresh rate of 1Hz to 120Hz. The crease is still visible when viewed off-axis but it&apos;s hardly a hindrance when consuming content in the regular fashion.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 though, has a more impressive folding display. It&apos;s a larger 6.9-inch pOLED panel with the same resolution as the Flip 5. It also has LTPO tech with a variable refresh rate, but up to 165Hz. Motorola has bumped up the peak brightness here up to 3,000 nits, which is quite impressive.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2024-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-hardware-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZZmzDFvpgiNo7hddfUbJoa" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-08.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZmzDFvpgiNo7hddfUbJoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 benefits from having the most recent processor, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. It&apos;s more of a mid-range flagship chip which we&apos;ve seen in a couple of recent Chinese phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">Poco F6</a> and Realme GT 6. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a proper flagship SoC from 2023 called the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Performance is excellent with multitasking and even with games. We didn&apos;t notice any sort of overheating either in our review.</p><p>Despite the different generation chipsets in both phones, real-world performance should be very similar. We&apos;ve seen the 8s Gen 3 belt out impressive benchmark numbers in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/realme-gt-6-review-a-well-rounded-mid-ranger">Realme GT 6</a> review, making it on par with the 8 Gen 2 SoC in many CPU-focused tests. If Motorola has optimized its software well enough, I don&apos;t think most users would notice any sort of performance difference.</p>

<p>The Razr Plus 2024 is only available in a single configuration of 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, priced at $1,000. The amount of RAM should be enough to offer smooth performance a few years down the line too. The single storage option is a bummer, especially since there&apos;s no microSD card slot. What&apos;s really interesting is that Motorola ditched the IP52 rating of the 2023 model in favor of an IPX8 rating. While the water resistance of the new model has improved drastically, it loses any official dust protection. We&apos;ll know for sure if this move was good or not after spending some time on the phone.</p><p>You get plenty of 5G bands in the new model, along with the latest Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. Sadly, the Type-C port is of the older USB 2.0 standard, which is a shame considering the Z Flip 5 has USB 3.2.</p><p>The Razr Plus also has a larger 4,000mAh battery compared to the Z Flip 5, which should allow it to run longer per charge. Motorola has made sure you can charge the battery quickly too if you get the optional 45W TurboPower charger. It also supports 15W wireless charging and 5W reverse wireless charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qbHAz6Kn266TPF8NX7WaUj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-review-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 tented" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qbHAz6Kn266TPF8NX7WaUj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3712" height="2088" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5 on the other hand is available with 256GB or 512GB of storage, and the latter variant often gets discounts making it cheaper than the base variant. However, there&apos;s only 8GB of RAM no matter which storage you go with. We didn&apos;t experience any sort of performance issues in our review, but having more RAM is always a good thing, especially when you factor in all the AI features it now packs.</p><p>The Flip 5 also has an IPX8 rating, which helps it survive being submerged in water, but it&apos;s not so tough if it has to deal with dust or dirt. 5G works well with all the carriers in the U.S. and the speedy USB standard means transferring data to and from the device is quicker than most phones.</p><p>Battery life was a bit of a mixed bag in our experience, as heavy users might need to charge the Flip 5 a second time before the day is over. The 3,700mAh capacity can only last so long on a single charge. Charging speeds are not the quickest by today&apos;s standards either. You&apos;ll need Samsung&apos;s optional charger to charge it at 25W, but wireless charging is still a decent 15W.</p>

<p>One of the big deciding factors when buying a new phone is the cameras, and Motorola has made a pretty bold decision with the Razr Plus 2024. If you love taking ultrawide photos, then you&apos;ll want to skip the Moto since it doesn&apos;t have one. That&apos;s right, Motorola has gone with a 50MP 2x telephoto camera in its place. The company says it&apos;s a calculated move based on the data and usage patterns it has observed. I guess we&apos;ll let the sales of the phone speak to whether this was a good move or not.</p><p>The main camera is also a 50MP sensor with optical stabilization. We&apos;ll have our final verdict on the image quality after the review, but the cameras seemed capable in our brief hands-on time with the phone. The main camera uses a 32MP sensor just like before. You can expect all the typical shooting modes from past Motorola phones, including new AI-powered features called Action Shot and Adaptive Stabilization. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6AAwomDWq3tVr5PYr4x5K7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-review-6.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 in Flex Mode with the camera on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AAwomDWq3tVr5PYr4x5K7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3602" height="2026" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a pair of 12MP sensors on the outside (wide + ultrawide), and a 10MP sensor on the inside. These are the same ones from the Flip 4 and perform pretty well. It does a better job of capturing action shots thanks to reduced shutter lag, low-light photos are decent, and portrait shots are quite impressive. For a foldable of its type, the cameras are more than serviceable.</p>

<p>Software is probably one of the biggest differentiating factors for both phones. Samsung uses One UI 5.1, its heavily skinned version of Android 13, which comes with a whole bunch of customization options, and unique ways to use certain apps when the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is folded in half. Samsung has already begun rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> for the Flip 5 which upgrades the software to Android 14 and introduces the company&apos;s own AI solution called Galaxy AI which debuted with the S24 series. The Flip 5 is due to receive a total of four OS upgrades, which means it&apos;s going to be relevant for the next few years as well.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 ships with Android 14 out of the box, and is scheduled to get three years of OS upgrades. Motorola has been sluggish in delivering promised updates for its existing phones, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see if things improve going forward for the new Razr. Motorola has its own lean skin over Android called Hello UX, and it will be bringing a host of AI features too later this year via an update in order to compete with Samsung.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re not too finicky about local storage and rarely use the ultrawide camera on your current phone, you&apos;ll love the new Razr Plus 2024. It features big improvements over its predecessor in areas that matter like the display, performance, and cameras.  The fact that Motorola has managed all of this for the same price as the previous model is quite a feat. Samsung&apos;s offering is a safe bet and it might be better value if you can get a good deal on one. It&apos;s also available immediately, as the Razr Plus only goes on sale on July 24.</p><p>If you&apos;re not in any hurry, it&apos;s worth waiting for the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> to be revealed on July 10. It will most likely cost more than the current model but that premium could be justified if Samsung adds enough meaningful upgrades. The Z Flip 5 could also get a permanent price reduction, so either way, it doesn&apos;t hurt to wait. </p><p>Personally, I&apos;d pick the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 for its fantastic displays, lean software, and faster charging. I don&apos;t mind not having an ultrawide camera as I feel telephotos offer better versatility. Round that off with the excellent Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor and you have a very compelling foldable for $1,000.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, Motorola launched its foldables, the Razr 2024 and Razr Plus 2024, featuring massive screens with the touch of AI. </p><p>As anticipated and according to the most recent leaks, the Razr Plus 2024 comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> chipset, 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 50MP main camera, and a 50MP telephoto shooter with 2x optical zoom. The biggest win, however, is its 4-inch pOLED display cover screen, which Motorola says is the biggest cover screen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> yet.</p><p>The inner pOLED screen unfolds to a 6.9-inch 1080p panel with a 165Hz refresh rate and 3000 nits peak brightness. Users can find all apps compatible with the device&apos;s cover screen, including Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a>. The Razr Plus 2024 comes in four colorways: Midnight Blue, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, and Hot Pink.</p><p>There&apos;s also the standard Razr 2024, which is roughly the same size as the premium model but with a smaller cover screen. Its outer display is a 3.6-inch 90Hz OLED. At first glance, it looks like a refreshed version of last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>, but with some spec changes, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a> chipset, a larger 4,200mAh battery, and a 50MP main camera with OIS. The inner screen is similar at 6.9 inches but with a lower 120Hz refresh rate. The Razr comes in Beach Sand, Koala Grey, and Spritz Orange in vegan leather colorways.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-2024-series-flips-the-script-with-a-massive-cover-screen-and-ai-smarts">available for preorder</a> on July 10 and will go on sale on July 24, retailing for $999 and $699, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Several folks from Android Central and other tech enthusiasts within the industry were in for a surprise this week. Google sent out personalized invites to its upcoming "Made by Google" event, which is set to take place way ahead of fall this time.</p><p>The event will happen on August 13 (Tuesday) at Google headquarters in Mountain View, with the Keynote starting at 10 a.m. PT, followed by a hands-on product experience.</p><p>While we have a fair idea of what to expect at this event, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL, we anticipate that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, a new generation of Pixel Buds, Pixel Fold, and a new Pixel Tablet will also make their debut this August.

While it may seem strange that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-the-odd-timing-of-the-google-pixel-event-could-mean">Google opted to launch its flagship </a>products earlier this year,  we feel that Google could be trying to streamline its product announcements and beat competitors with the early event.</p><p>Registrations for the event will begin July 31.<br></p>

The company is set to host its next Galaxy Unpacked event on July 10 in Paris, France. The company states it is preparing to reveal its rollout of "cutting-edge innovations."</p><p>We expect an event loaded with new devices this summer as Samsung prepares to debut the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>. The company showed off the device during MWC 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">and confirmed</a> some key specifications. Dr Hon Pak, head of the Samsung digital health team, informed the press that the Galaxy Ring&apos;s battery is estimated to last between "five and nine days."</p><p>Other than the ring, the company&apos;s next foldables might also be launching, several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/overseas-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-listing-color-leak">recent leaks showed</a> renders of the the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6. We would likely see several other wearables, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 and 7 Ultra</a> also make an appearance at the event. </p><p>EVP and Head of R&D Mobile Experience, Won-Joon Choi, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-ai-experience-optimized-upcoming-foldable-teased">teased in June</a> that an "optimized" Galaxy AI experience would arrive on its clamshell and book-style devices.

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-leak"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>On Tuesday (June 25), Canada&apos;s Amazon listing ended up showcasing the rumored and upcoming Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and its specs. </p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://passionategeekz.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-revealed-features-and-pricing-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank">PassionateGeekz</a>, the listing showcases the regular Galaxy Watch 7 Bluetooth variant featuring 40mm size and a price tag of CAD 358 (~$268). It further confirms that the smartwatch will feature a round-shaped display and sport at least 128GB of storage. It will be powered by a 3nm SoC that promises to boost power efficiency and carry out smoother all-round operations.</p><p>The leak alleges that the watch will have a BioActiveSensor that tracks health features like heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen levels — during workouts, sleep with sleep quality analysis, and more. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> will likely sport Galaxy AI, and as the description points out, "Personalized Daily AI Companion for AI-Powered Sleep, Exercises, and communication." This isn&apos;t too surprising, given the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI 6 Watch beta</a> brings said features to the Galaxy Watch 6 and other compatible watches. Another thing to note about this listing is that the Galaxy Watch 7 could come in a Cream colorway, along with multiple color options. </p><p>The Amazon listing also shows that the watch could be delivered to users as early as July 16.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>There&apos;s a debate around students using AI: "Is it safe to give them access and help them learn, or is AI basically making them lazy?" This week, Google wanted to add another leaf to that existing debate.</p><p>The company announced that it&apos;s preparing to bring Gemini to teen students using school accounts in "over 100 countries." According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/ai-workspace-chromebook-iste-2024/" target="_blank">Keyword post</a>, the company detailed that "in the coming months," teens at the minimum age requirement (13) can chat with Gemini through their school account. </p><p>Google states that Gemini&apos;s capabilities will be disabled by default, but school admins can enable it through the "Admin console." A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/workspace-gemini-classroom-iste-2024/" target="_blank">subsequent post</a> states that students using Gemini through a school account will have checks in place to block inappropriate content. </p><p>Gemini will filter out "illegal or age-gated substances" from appearing in its results. Additionally, the AI will run a fact-check on a response when asked for the first time. Looks like Google is trying to meet educators and students in the middle by allowing "teen students to learn responsibly and confidently in an AI-first future." It remains to be seen how these schools will incorporate the power of artificial intelligence into their curriculum.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung has confirmed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Galaxy Unpacked starts on July 10</a>, when it&apos;ll show off the latest wearables, foldables, and even a smart ring. That means Samsung has a lot of old inventory to clear out, and fast. And with Amazon Prime Day coming up just a week after Unpacked, you may want to wait on the new Galaxy Watch 7 or Watch Ultra in favor of a cheaper Galaxy Watch 6 or FE.</p><p>Last year&apos;s Prime event took place before Unpacked, but Samsung still took a fire-sale approach. You could get a Galaxy Watch 5 for $151 or $128 off, which was the lowest price we&apos;d ever seen on it. Its LTE variants were $100 off as well. And you could snag a Z Fold 4 for an absurd $700 off.</p><p>Right now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6?th=1" target="_blank"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6 is $239 ($60 off)</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Streaming/dp/B0C63CFZ68" target="_blank"><strong>Galaxy Z Fold 5 is $400 off</strong></a>, which are pretty good deals in their own right. But if you&apos;re patient, I predict these prices will fall to new lows once Prime Day starts on July 16—just six days after Unpacked.</p><p>Of course, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w" target="_blank"><strong>reserve a Galaxy Watch 7 pre-order for $50 off</strong></a> from Samsung, if you want the most cutting-edge tech and features. That&apos;s not a bad deal! Then again, Galaxy Watches tend not to change much from one generation to the next, and you may want to prioritize spending as little as possible.</p>

<p>All the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 rumors</a> say it could have 32GB of storage and a slightly faster CPU, but it should be pretty similar to the Watch 6 in style and sensors, and any new Wear OS upgrades like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-ai-health-and-fitness-insights">Galaxy AI health stats</a> will come to the Watch 6 just a couple of weeks after the Watch 7 launch.</p><p>I wrote last year that Samsung needed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-s9-offers-4x-storage-galaxy-watch-6">give Galaxy Watches more storage</a>, and some people will need the doubled space for music playlists or extra apps. But otherwise, if you can save $100 or more on a Watch 6 with another three years of promised upgrades, you may want to "downgrade" to our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">favorite Android watch</a> of the past 12 months.</p><p>Also, remember that Samsung ran out of Galaxy Watch 5 stock pretty quickly after Prime Day last year. So, if you want a cheaper last-gen option, July or August would be the time to buy one.</p><p>Now, if you want the leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra</a>, with all the top-end specs and multi-day battery life that entails, then disregard the deal-hunting and preorder that instead. But I assume it&apos;ll cost more than many of you will willingly pay if its price is anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>&apos;s.</p><p>We&apos;ve heard conflicting rumors about whether Samsung will sell a new Watch 7 Pro or Classic, in addition to the Ultra. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Watch 5 Pro</a> has stuck around for two years, but I&apos;d expect an everything-must-go sale on them if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-chip-performance-rumors">Watch 7 Pro</a> really exists.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:908px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="N627yqjsmPa4gr54wEYxLi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-FE-press-photo-running.jpeg" alt="A photo of a woman running while wearing the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N627yqjsmPa4gr54wEYxLi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="908" height="511" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your other money-saving option is the new Galaxy Watch FE, which is essentially a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-4">Galaxy Watch 4 re-release</a> with added Sapphire Crystal and a fresh set of software updates. It starts at $199, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-deal-drops-the-new-galaxy-watch-fe-to-only-dollar99-with-any-smartwatch-trade-in-guaranteed">cut the price to $99 with a smartwatch trade-in</a>. So, if you have an old pre-Wear OS Galaxy Watch lying around in a closet, you can get a solid smartwatch for less than an Amazfit.</p><p>Now, we can always hope that Samsung will wow us with the Galaxy Watch 7 announcement at Galaxy Unpacked. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-buds-3-series-render-leak">leaked renders</a> make it <em>look</em> pretty darn similar to the Watch 6, aside from some colorful stitching on the default silicone band. We&apos;ll have to hope for more intangible upgrades, like better battery life or revamped health sensors.</p><p>We&apos;ll find out more on July 10! But since it&apos;ll ship a few weeks after Unpacked, that gives you time to check out Prime Day 2024 first and see if Samsung makes the Galaxy Watch 6 cheap enough to tempt you. That way, you can put that extra cash towards a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> or foldable phone instead.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to feature rounded corners, making it more comfortable to hold compared to its sharper predecessors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> rocks a minimalist look with its flat screen and sharp edges. It’s definitely a head-turner and one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android picks</a>, but this design leans more towards style than comfort. Those sharp corners can start to press into your palms during extended use, making it a bit less hand-friendly.</p><p>Supporting design shift rumors, industry insider Ice Universe reported discomfort from the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s sharp corners. This aligns with claims that the phone&apos;s boxy design isn&apos;t ergonomic for long-term use. Ice Universe suggests the next model might feature "really rounded" corners like the Galaxy Note 7.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S25 Ultra is as round as Galaxy Note7, and I like this change. pic.twitter.com/KLrd2Y3BFg<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1806530264421871906">June 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Don&apos;t expect a total redesign, though: the S25 Ultra is likely to keep its iconic boxy look. But those annoying sharp corners might get a much-needed rounding off for better comfort.</p><p>While the leaker didn&apos;t dive into design details, the rumored shift in corner design aligns with previous claims. Talks of a revamped Ultra model, including changes to the bezels and frame, have been making the rounds on the web.</p><p>This potential update aims to address user feedback and enhance the overall experience. The S24 Ultra&apos;s sharp corners have been reported to cause discomfort, especially during prolonged use.</p><p>Adding rounded corners to the Galaxy S25 Ultra might not be a radical change for Samsung, especially since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and S24 Plus already feature them. If anything, this move promotes a cohesive design across the S25 series, unifying the design language of Samsung&apos;s flagship line.</p><p>Despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series&apos; expected January launch, some details are already surfacing. Recent leaks hint at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fresh-leak-suggests-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-get-a-major-camera-boost">possible upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Ultra&apos;s rear camera</a>, with rumors of a resolution boost. Rumor also has it that the upcoming Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-nano-v2-galaxy-s25-report-claim">will use Google&apos;s next-gen on-device AI model, Gemini Nano 2</a>.</p>

Given that I switch phones every two weeks on average, it doesn&apos;t make sense to attach a case either. The only outlier to this rule is the iPhone; I&apos;ve been using an iPhone as my secondary phone for nearly five years now, and as there&apos;s only one model a year, it&apos;s in continuous use — unlike most Android phones.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that iPhones are significantly costlier than their Android counterparts in this side of the world. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> costs $415 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-camera-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, and it just seemed prudent to use a case. Doing so makes using the iPhone 15 Pro Max that much easier; I don&apos;t like the flat sides of the device, and a case allows it to be that much more comfortable to hold. </p><p>The only Android phone that merits this treatment is the Pixel; I switch back to the current-gen Pixel throughout the course of the year, and I&apos;m just not confident in Google&apos;s build quality, so it also gets a case. Anyway, you&apos;re not here to learn how I use phones; you want to see which is the best case for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, so let&apos;s get started.</p><p>I reached out to Spigen, Caseology, Peak Design, Casetify, and Mujjo, and got 12 cases in total to use with the device. Additionally, Apple sent two cases along with the phone, including the FineWoven option and a wallet case, but they&apos;re not as good as third-party cases, so I won&apos;t highlight them.</p>

<p>I like Peak Design&apos;s tech bag and accessories, so it was a natural choice to test the brand&apos;s Everyday Case. The case is made out of a nylon canvas fabric shell and feels great to hold and use, but it adds considerable bulk to the device. It has raised edges at the front that ensure the screen isn&apos;t damaged should the phone take a tumble, and the buttons have excellent tactility.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KPvrKLrAnK7Q9YiQTzRjAF" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-4.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KPvrKLrAnK7Q9YiQTzRjAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is a MagSafe case, so if you have any attachments, you can easily slot those in without any issues. The best part of the Everyday Case is that it uses Peak Design&apos;s innovative mounting system (called SlimLink), allowing you to attach a diverse set of accessories and mounts to the back of the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>

<p>It is a unique differentiator, and having used the case with a few accessories over the last six months, it is now my go-to choice. The only issue I have with the case is that it extends out a bit over the USB-C port, so you can&apos;t use USB-C cables with wide connectors.</p>
<p>I got the Everyday Case in Sage, but it is also available in four other color options, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Mobile-Everyday-Compatible/dp/B0CSCNF228">retailing at $49</a>, it is a great choice if you want a durable case with extensibility. I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-pixel-8-pro-cases">same case with my Pixel 8 Pro</a> as well, and it is just as great. </p>

<p>Mujjo makes the best leather cases, and the brand outdid itself with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The Full Leather Case feels exquisite to use, and it is incredibly light. The case has a leather finish on all sides, and you get microfiber lining on the inside along with a polycarbonate shell.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DGE7QreVRX8MzafzbnfNdH" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-9.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DGE7QreVRX8MzafzbnfNdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mujjo went with metal buttons, and they have great tactility. The only drawback is that the Action button is covered up, but other than that, I couldn&apos;t find any faults with this Mujjo case. It also has raised edges, but they don&apos;t extend out as much, and it works seamlessly with any MagSafe accessories.</p>

<p>I used the leather case for a few months after getting it, and if it weren&apos;t for the added versatility of the Everyday Case, this would still be on my iPhone 15 Pro Max. I got the burgundy variant of the case, but that&apos;s sold out at Mujjo at the moment; the plus side is that the available colors are on sale, and you can get the leather case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mujjo.com/collections/iphone-15-pro-max/products/full-leather-case-for-iphone-15-pro-max?variant=43919844737272">for as low as $41</a>. If you prefer wallet cases, Mujjo also makes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mujjo.com/collections/iphone-15-pro-max/products/full-leather-magsafe-wallet-case-for-iphone-15-pro-max">leather wallet case</a>, and that is available in burgundy.</p>

<p>I always recommend Spigen whenever someone asks for a clear case recommendation; the brand does these better than most, and it has a great selection for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I&apos;m partial to the Ultra Hybrid Zero One for obvious reasons — the case just looks plain cool, and it does a great job highlighting the innards of the iPhone.</p>

<p>It is incredibly slim and light, the clear sides accentuate the titanium chassis of the phone well, and the case retains its clear design without any yellowing even with extended use. It also has strong magnets, and pairs well with any MagSafe accessory. The only quibble is that the sides are glossy; the back itself has a matte texture and is great to hold, and it would have been better if the sides had the same coating.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I don&apos;t have any issues with this case, and if you want a clear case that stands out a bit, the Ultra Hybrid Zero One is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Anti-Yellowing-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CB775ZNS">no-brainer at its sale price of $21</a>. If you want a regular clear case, the Ultra Hybrid S is my recommendation. It is a great way to showcase the design of the phone, and there&apos;s a built-in kickstand as well. Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Anti-Yellowing-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S8F1VD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3LE9R0EGQF31A&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.G_FpcKjD_M2x1E2acq3C2nAlOdZyaF3SwNYXPbhknBDWx_mrfwJ6g-jsfwhDkYtQkaVof4KS-uUJlktej9K7jHY9k197Nf-FYRKnECqENGmKhaNl6ndUkPQM1kvi4uJxL0tjzj2zE4-_RmBhhr0WGxTETBnPNNflYW1WlvS03_pC0accTQ-amq7tZNOfDNkZ3jCMXyocbx049CStXc7emv6VRQtDpKLVfithaMAtn8o.ahNVEGYOEhKpduj4vcTbnxV88QP73Oaub1uM3YLoh9A&dib_tag=se&keywords=spigen%2Bultra%2Bhybrid%2Bs%2Biphone%2B15%2Bpro%2Bmax&qid=1719546380&sprefix=Ultra%2BHybrid%2BS%2B%2Caps%2C308&sr=8-3&th=1">at just $25</a>, it is a standout value.</p>

<p>If you need rugged protection, the Enzo Aramid case utilizes a combination of TPU with Aramid to deliver standout durability. It doesn&apos;t add much bulk to the phone, but it has noticeable heft, and you get metal buttons on the sides that have good tactility. The inside of the case is lined with microfiber, and its magnets are just as strong as the Ultra Hybrid Zero One. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CBD34N2V">costlier at $39</a>, but still a decent choice considering what&apos;s on offer.</p>

<p>Caseology is a Spigen subsidiary, and it makes colorful cases that stand out. I used the Parallax Mag and NanoPop Mag cases with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I prefer the former. It has a textured finish at the back that makes it easy to hold, but what I like best is that the sides also get a textured design. This makes all the difference in daily use, and the case itself is thin and light.</p><p>And at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Enhanced-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0C641NM3Z">just $20</a>, it is a great bargain. I got the case in Midnight Blue, but it is also available in black and burgundy. As the name suggests, the case is designed to be used with MagSafe accessories, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this area.</p>

<p>If you just want a versatile case that does it all, my pick would be the Everyday Case by Peak Design. It is on the bulkier side as these things go, but you get excellent protection, and the ability to mount accessories is an added bonus. Similarly, if you&apos;re looking to get a leather case, your search ends with Mujjo; the brand is the best in this regard, and the Full Leather Case is a terrific choice.</p><p>I got Casetify&apos;s cases as well, but the build quality isn&apos;t quite on par with the rest of the picks I highlighted above, and they don&apos;t measure up to long-term use. So for any general-use cases — like Aramid-based choices or clear designs — you should just go with Spigen — the Ultra Hybrid Zero One series is gorgeous, and it accentuates the iPhone 15 Pro Max incredibly well.</p>

<p>New information highlights Qualcomm&apos;s new efforts to solve the problem behind slow Android updates from OEMs with extensive product libraries.</p><p>According to an interview between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-updates-oems-2024-3455346/">Android Authority</a> and Qualcomm&apos;s SVP and General Manager of Handsets, Chris Patrick, help is on the way. Patrick informed the publication that "it is very complicated for a customer — an OEM — to get security updates, to get Android version updates, and then get it to every end user."</p><p>One of the many causes for slow update reception is older chipsets within an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. Typically, as with any piece of technology, the older the piece, the less likely support will be maintained. This causes a disconnect between the user and the OEM providing the Android update.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s Chris Patrick stated that a phone&apos;s SoC isn&apos;t the <em>only </em>culprit, but it does contribute, which is why they&apos;ve "been working on for the past several years with Google and with the OEMs is to change the structure of inline code." As a result, Patrick is hopeful that the changes will aid OEMs in keeping more of their product catalogs up-to-date in a closer timeframe.</p><p>The company teased more "code optimization" information to come, but that won&apos;t happen until "later this year." Moreover, as the publication noted, Qualcomm&apos;s improvements won&apos;t magically see the adoption of five or seven-year update support for devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">what Google promised users</a>.</p><p>To Patrick, the company&apos;s changes should at least make it <em>easier </em>for Android updates to flow rather than constricting what&apos;s possible software-wise.</p><p>Following Google&apos;s update support announcement, Samsung started to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-expand-security-updates-beyond-5-years">ponder a similar route</a>. The Korean OEM typically supported its higher-tier devices for four years, delivering major Android OS updates alongside five years of security patches. Both areas see importance as the former brings new features and refreshments while the latter strengthens devices against online dangers.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">ended up following in Google&apos;s footsteps</a> as its recent launch of the Galaxy S24 series promises seven years of Android updates and security patches.</p><p>What&apos;s important here is Qualcomm&apos;s teaser of more to come later in 2024. The company is expected to host its next summit in Hawaii in October. There, we&apos;ll hear about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> SoC. It&apos;s unclear if Qualcomm has plugged these machinery upgrades into its next flagship chip. However, its general manager&apos;s words give hope.</p>
