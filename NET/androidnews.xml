VR devs target the Meta Quest store first because it has the most users, so aside from a few rare PC VR or PSVR 2 exclusives, all of the best VR games <em>period</em> are available for the Quest 3, 3S, and 2. Plus, Meta now shows indie App Lab games on its storefront, so search results are flooded now with Gorilla Tag clones.</p><p>No one wants to spend money on junk games or experiences with low value, but it&apos;s hard sifting through thousands of games. That&apos;s where our team of VR fanatics comes in!</p><p>We spend a lot of leisure time blocking out reality with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, as we did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a>, and every pick on our list comes personally played or recommended by our two resident VR fanatics, Nick Sutrich and Michael Hicks, as well as our freelance team of VR writers.</p><p>Our picks below are our <strong>favorite 25 Meta Quest games</strong> across all genres.

<p><em>Note</em>: We&apos;ve organized our best Meta Quest games picks in alphabetical order, rather than try to rank games like Beat Saber, Supernatural, or Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 with very different strengths and hooks.</p>
<h2 id="asgard-apos-s-wrath-2-2">Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3SYJeM_LaZ0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>THE best Meta Quest game, hands down</strong></p><p>Sometimes, a game is so good you can hardly believe it exists. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2</a> is one such game, and while it&apos;s not a recognizable IP to non-VR fans, Quest owners who jump into this world will never forget it.</p><p>Simply put, Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 is the best VR game ever made. It&apos;s a massive 100+ hour-long RPG stuffed with combat, loot, exploration, puzzles, mini-games, and even a roguelike game-within-a-game. Big-name voice actors fill the game with superb dialog, and the score is both epic and memorable in a way seldom seen in VR.</p><p>Developer Sanzaru Games spent the first game — which is excellent but designed for Oculus Rift only — in Northern Europe. This time, you follow protagonist Loki to ancient Egypt, where the gods are big and the lands are even bigger.</p><p>You&apos;ll explore a total of four different realms, each of which introduces a new playable character. Each character can traverse through the realms, helping to add some Metroidvania-like exploration qualities to the already massive game. During your travels, you&apos;ll also meet five companions, each with a unique move set and transformation into a helper or mount.</p><p>As you progress through the game, you&apos;ll earn experience points that can be spent on massive skill trees for upgrades. But it&apos;s not just each character that has a skill tree. Each companion has its own skill tree, as well, encouraging players to explore the procedurally-generated Uncharted Rifts regularly, or just scour the landscape in search of monster dens and Loki anomalies to pillage.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing bigger or more robust in VR than Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2. — <em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>
<h2 id="assassin-apos-s-creed-nexus-vr-2">Assassin&apos;s Creed Nexus VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qjhB9xeELo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>A return to Assassin&apos;s Creed roots, with a 30-hour campaign and full freedom of movement</strong></p><p>If you told me a few years ago that we would have a full and proper Assassin&apos;s Creed VR game on the Meta Quest platform, I would have said you were a liar. Fast-forward a few years to the Meta Quest 3&apos;s debut and, somehow, here we are.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin&apos;s Creed Nexus VR</a> is the return to roots the series has needed after straying so far from the original formula for the past several entries. The game focuses on climbing, parkour, stealth, and, of course, assassination, all while wrapping the action around a compelling storyline.</p><p>You&apos;ll jump in the shoes of a hacker helping the Templars retrieve pieces of an ancient computer from memories stored in Abstergo&apos;s cloud. But a computer that can tell the future and give the Templars full control is too much for the Assassins, and you get hired on as a double agent bent on deleting the key components of the memories to hide this computer forever.</p><p>Play as Conor, Ezio, and Kassandra as you make your way through 2,500 years of human history in over 15 memories, each of which takes place in a different location. The first tie you climb up a Venetian building and parkour off its roof to the adjacent building, you&apos;ll immediately feel at home. This is the game we wanted, a proper game instead of a spin-off or on-rails experience. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<h2 id="beat-saber-2">Beat Saber</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZyKEdxda84" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>A VR icon that&apos;s only gotten more massive</strong></p><p>I still remember the original Beat Saber trailer blowing me away. Holding lightsabers laser swords and slicing blocks to the beat of a song, all in VR? Talk about a dream come true! Little did I know what simply looked like a ton of fun would become the defining reason that so many people would jump into VR. Beat Saber is for anyone and everyone, with skill levels and songs to please all sorts. </p><p>Beat Saber hardly needs my introduction. It&apos;s become a pop culture icon the way no other VR game can even claim, boasting over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/beat-saber-surpasses-100-million-revenue-oculus-quest-platform">$100 million in sales</a> on the Quest in 2021 — and probably much more since. </p><p>Since Meta acquired it, Beat Saber has added dozens of DLC packs from Imagine Dragons, BTS, Skrillex, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Linkin Park, The Weeknd, Queen, The Rolling Stones, and even Daft Punk, plus medley packs themed around genres like hip-hop, rock, and electronic.</p><p>The addictive block-slicing gameplay will have you coming back again and again until you, quite literally, can&apos;t move your arms. If this one isn&apos;t already in your library, fix that mistake this instant. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>
<h2 id="blade-amp-sorcery-nomad-2">Blade & Sorcery: Nomad</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGhfvY5giVA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Medieval duels backed by a realistic physics engine</strong></p><p>One of the most popular PC VR games, Blade & Sorcery is a giant sandbox where you fight foes with swords, bows and arrows, or magical attacks. Its popularity stems from the realistic physics engine, which lets you parry or deflect attacks and ensures your weapons don&apos;t just teleport through foes.</p><p>Now it is available untethered on the Quest 2 & 3 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blade-sorcery-nomad-oculus-quest-hands-on">Blade & Sorcery: Nomad</a>, so your duels to the death can become fully roomscale. Plus, it adds a new procedurally generated Dungeons mode in which you traverse through different environments, vanquishing foes, collecting loot, and leveling up your skills. This port will even allow you to use mods, which creative gamers have used to add foes from Star Wars, Marvel, and other popular brands.</p><p>Nick described B&S combat as "a balanced mix of "video gamey" and semi-realistic that feels just right. The Goldilocks of VR weapon handling, if you will," in his hands-on. He encouraged me to try it, and I loved the hack-and-slash gameplay too. It&apos;s impressive that developer Warpfrog managed to make the game work with the Quest&apos;s limited hardware at all, and it&apos;s been a blast to play so far. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>
<h2 id="breachers-2">Breachers</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g90TqmqiNRk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Serious shooter fans, start here</strong></p><p>As I said in our review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/breachers-is-the-best-multiplayer-quest-game-ive-ever-played" target="_blank">Breachers</a> is the best multiplayer game I&apos;ve yet played on Quest. Given the general quality of games on this very list, that&apos;s saying quite a bit, but it also highlights one of the things missing from a lot of VR games — yes, even the best ones. Polish.</p><p>Breachers is polished in a way that makes it feel like it was developed by a AAA studio including a distinct lack of bugs and "jank," as people like to call it. It&apos;s also got some of the very best graphics and 3D audio of any Quest game I&apos;ve played, and I&apos;ve played <em>a lot </em>of Quest games.</p><p>Breachers is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter that channels the best parts of games like Rainbow Six: Siege. One side plays SWAT (Enforcers), the other side plays terrorists (Revolters). Revolters begin inside a building and have already planted a bomb. Meanwhile, Enforcers are charged with breaching the compound and disarming the bomb before it detonates.</p><p>Each round begins with a minute-or-so-long period where players can buy new gear and plan their attack or defense. Revolters have access to traps that can be set up in the building to ward off the Enforcers while the bomb&apos;s timer ticks down.</p><p>Meanwhile, Enforcers have access to gadgets like cloaking devices and drones that will help them infiltrate the building successfully. Plus, enforcers can rappel up and down walls and use breaching foam to detonate specific walls that can be used in a surprise attack.</p><p>It&apos;s a ton of fun that involves teamwork and skill, and there&apos;s always the team deathmatch mode if you just want to shoot it out for a few rounds. My only request is that the developers add in a squad mode so you can travel with your crew of friends. Otherwise, you&apos;re looking at the most polished, impressive game launch we&apos;ve seen in VR since Half-Life: Alyx. — <em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>
<h2 id="contractors-showdown-2">Contractors Showdown</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-umOG8MkZzA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>The VR battle royale you&apos;ve been waiting for</strong></p><p>Contractors earns two spots on our best Quest games list: You&apos;ll find Contractors under Multiplayer Shooters on the next page as a traditional FPS experience, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/contractors-showdown-meta-quest-3">Contractors Showdown</a> is for Battle Royale fans, and it excels at it.</p><p>Contractors Showdown lets you play with triple the number of players as Population: One. It has the traditional BR start with you dropping down onto a massive map with some impressive realism and plenty of weapons and support items scattered throughout. You also wear a wrist-based computer where you can control kill-streak perks like drones or air raids.</p><p>If you&apos;re familiar with battle royales, then you&apos;ll feel right at home with Showdown. You&apos;ll get used to different weapon types and builds and learn on the fly against other players. It&apos;s a great way to get your Warzone-esque fix without the less grounded gameplay of Pop: One. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>
<h2 id="demeo-2">Demeo</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-s5RPGTfP_E" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Far over the Misty Mountains cold, to dungeons deep and caverns old</strong></p><p>Take to the dungeons and complete thrilling campaigns alongside three other friends (or random folks) in this Dungeons & Dragons-like experience. Players choose a character — each of which has a unique class and set of skills — that will be used to traverse through each campaign. Those campaigns are made up of multi-level dungeons filled with treasures and trials alike. Aside from the standard move-by-grid gameplay, players can look to their hands for special moves played with cards.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/demeo-hands-on">Demeo</a> is as much a great multiplayer game as it is an excellent strategy game. Sure, you could delve into the dungeons on your own, but you&apos;ll quickly find that Demeo is a bit too challenging for just one player. Thankfully, if you don&apos;t have any friends with the game, matchmaking will pair you up with the strategy experts and avid D&D fans that make up the Demeo community. There&apos;s even a hangout area the developer calls the Tinyverse where folks can meet up and plan games together.</p><p>Demeo launched with a single campaign and received a second just a few months after release. Since then, it&apos;s added several new campaigns and playable characters, complete with new spell cards, bosses, and exciting new modes to come. You can even use the Quest&apos;s mixed reality features to play the virtual game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-played-virtual-dandd-on-a-real-table-with-the-quest-pro-and-it-was-amazing" target="_blank">on a real table</a>. Then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/demeo-battles-announcement">Demeo Battles</a> launched in 2023 as a separate PvP mode, letting you become the Dungeon Master you&apos;ve always wanted to be! —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>
<h2 id="dungeons-of-eternity-2">Dungeons of Eternity</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kAR9Qp112fE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Dungeon-crawling excellence</strong></p><p>If you&apos;re a gamer who loves fantasy, chances are high that you&apos;ve imagined what it would be like to actually live out a Dungeons & Dragons adventure. To say Dungeons of Eternity offers that experience would be selling it short. Dungeons of Eternity is all that and so much more.</p><p>It&apos;s a co-op dungeon crawler for up to three players (though solo play is fully supported) with a robust combat system that combines ranged, magic, and physical attacks. You can alternate between heavy axe swings, parrying with your sword, and then unloading your crossbow mid-battle with a wide variety of vicious monsters, all with other players fighting alongside you. Android Central&apos;s Nick Sutritch said it best in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/dungeons-and-dragons-meta-quest-vr-games">his hands-on impressions</a>: "I&apos;m not sure I can think of another VR game that made me feel as badass as Dungeons of Eternity." </p><p>The combat alone is enough to be excited about, but when you factor in that this is a roguelike with randomization between runs and a near-endless amount of randomly generated loot, it&apos;s clear that Dungeons of Eternity is offering a truly next-level VR experience. —<em>Nick Ransbottom</em></p>
<h2 id="a-fisherman-apos-s-tale-series-2">A Fisherman&apos;s Tale series</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfxByOgyWaY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>A dream within a dream within a dream</strong></p><p>There&apos;s really just no comparison to how perspective can be used in VR, and A Fisherman&apos;s Tale is the perfect example of a game that thrives on the aspect of perspective and scale that VR can bring. What starts as a tale of a simple fisherman who mans a lighthouse quickly evolves into a tale of psychological wonder.</p><p>Players will interact with every object in the lighthouse, but beware: you may not be controlling who you think you&apos;re controlling. Are you the fisherman himself or the puppet in the model lighthouse? Are these stories real, or are they tall tales from a sailor who has seen too many days lost at sea?</p><p>Riddles, mind-bending mysteries, tricky puzzles, and bizarre situations await you in one of the most unique puzzle games you&apos;ll likely ever play. This one isn&apos;t just about matching shapes up to complete a goal. It&apos;s also about living through an adventure story and adapting to the realities you begin to uncover.</p><p>When you&apos;re done with that, A Fisherman&apos;s Tale 2 completely changes things up by introducing brand new mechanics including larger, free-roam areas. Your days as a fisherman haven&apos;t just given you tall tales to tell, they&apos;ve also imbued you with special powers that can only be called by the sea.</p><p>Whether you&apos;re tossing your hand and controlling it remotely like <em>Thing</em> from The Addam&apos;s Family or even popping off your own head to rest in a bird nest, Another Fisherman&apos;s Tale is filled to the brim with creativity and a surprisingly touching narrative that&apos;s sure to bring you to tears when it&apos;s all done. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>
<h2 id="five-nights-at-freddy-apos-s-help-wanted-1-amp-2-2">Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s: Help Wanted 1 & 2</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-OETgUnEeU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Chuck E. Cheese animatronics weren&apos;t even close to being this scary</strong></p><p>There are two types of Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s (FNaF) fans out there: those who obsessively watch theory videos about the Bite of &apos;87 and those who just enjoy watching their favorite YouTuber scream over animatronic jumpscares. The Quest ports appeal to both types. You can revisit scenes from old entries and get to interpret obscure lore moments, but it also lets casual fans enjoy jumpscares without worrying about the details.</p><p>As someone who saw the original games as kind of cheesy and too repetitive, let me assure you that the gameplay is so much more frightening and tense in VR. Unlike other horror games with stories that ease you into scary scenarios, FNaF:HW has nearly nonstop moments of tension. Plus, the mix of different gameplay mechanics from different games ensures that things feel more varied, and the Halloween DLC pack is excellent.</p><p>Help Wanted 2 is a step up because they focused more on making an original VR game working at the Pizzaplex Salon, while still adding VR minigames from the mainline series like Sister Location. It feels like you can immerse yourself more in the world, instead of just lore cameos of other games&apos; worlds. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>
<h2 id="genotype-2">Genotype</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHP03lR0N70" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>A Metroid Prime-esque experience</strong></p><p>One of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-quest-3-launch-games#section-genotype">favorite Quest 3 launch games</a>, Genotype is an FPS Metroidvania shooter set on an abandoned Arctic research base swarming with monsters. You&apos;re overtaken by deadly spores, but before you die, you can wield these invading organisms as unique weapons, fighting fire with fire.</p><p>Each weapon operates very differently, and all can be swapped at will with a clever string mechanic — pull the string on your wrist and stop when the weapon you want pops up. It&apos;s similar to how character-switching works in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bonelab-review-the-new-standard-for-vr-physics-based-games">Bonelab</a> if you&apos;ve had the opportunity to play that. And a February 2024 update added a bunch of new weaponized creatures, enemies, difficulty settings, and upgrades to increase replayability.</p><p>Genotype has more polish than your typical VR game, from the voice acting and compelling story to the mechanics. And it looks fantastic on the Quest 3 thanks to its unique graphical update. If you&apos;re looking for a game to sink plenty of time into, start here! —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>
<h2 id="gorilla-tag-2">Gorilla Tag</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HV1O9TaK_qg?start=32" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Join the biggest party on the Quest</strong></p><p>Recapture the magic of chasing friends around on the playground, except as a low-resolution gorilla swinging from branches or leaping from buildings. The straightforward gameplay and free download have turned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-quest-game-of-the-week">Gorilla Tag</a> into one of the most popular games on the platform, especially among younger gamers.</p><p>New game modes like Infection, Hunt, and Paintbrawl, the addition of six levels for variety, and monthly updates keep things fun on the regular. Plus, you can always find players looking to try custom minigames and make friends.</p><p>You&apos;ll also collect "shiny rocks" to buy customizations and give your monkey a unique look. Don&apos;t be surprised if you end up sinking a ton of time into this free game, so long as you aren&apos;t scared off by voice chat.</p><p>As the game&apos;s tagline says, it&apos;s time to "become monke." —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>
<h2 id="i-expect-you-to-die-1-x2013-3-2">I Expect You to Die 1–3</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPRi3ggiP7s" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>James Bond meets MacGuyver</strong></p><p>I&apos;ll always love 2016&apos;s I Expect You to Die, one of the first VR games I ever played. While it&apos;s still worth playing, its sequel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-expect-you-die-2-review">I Expect You to Die 2</a> steps things up in terms of better graphics, more fun escape-the-room set pieces, amazing voice acting, and a blast of a story.</p><p>Named after Goldfinger&apos;s iconic line to James Bond, IEYTD 2 makes the homage obvious with an amazing psychedelic intro complete with a ballad by Puddles Pity Party. You play as a secret agent who must navigate a series of escape room-like traps and scenarios, facing off against a nefarious foe voiced by Wil Wheaton. The sandbox-esque levels are full of objects you can pick up telekinetically and pull to you, and you never know what random item will save you from death.</p><p>Be prepared to die a lot — the game does warn you — as you try to find unorthodox solutions to deadly situations by trial and error. At times frustrating and illogical, I Expect You to Die 2 feels triumphant when you finally find solutions — and if you keep a sense of humor, your deaths are frequently hilarious. The game is relatively short, but you can replay levels to find trophies and alternate solutions to puzzles that give you achievements.</p><p>Then, of course, you have the trilogy bookend, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-expect-you-to-die-3-hands-on">I Expect You to Die 3</a>, which keeps the same escape-room formula and excellent voice acting, but also the same seated gameplay instead of letting you explore deadly rooms yourself. I&apos;d like to see Schell Games keep the aesthetics and quality but switch things up for future games. For now, though, this trilogy is a must-buy for puzzler fans. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>A bomb in the living room? Defuse it, now!</strong></p><p>You&apos;re alone in a room with an elaborately armed bomb. Your colleagues off-site have acquired the codes used by the bomb-maker, but there&apos;s a ticking clock and no time for them to reach you and disarm it themselves. You have no choice: you must relay the complex mechanics of the bomb to them exactly, so they can tell you how to dismantle it in time. Make too many mistakes, or take too long to find the solution, and it&apos;s game over!</p><p>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a local couch co-op game. It&apos;s been around since the original Oculus Rift and since then has ported to Android, iOS, PC, Switch, Playstation, Xbox, PSVR, and Quest. The core gameplay hasn&apos;t changed, and you don&apos;t <em>need</em> to play this in VR; all you need is the free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bombmanual.com/">bomb manual</a>, and to make sure that the one disarming the bomb can&apos;t see it from where they play. But this is a case where VR&apos;s natural isolation works in your favor: it makes you feel trapped with no escape, making the bomb&apos;s countdown that much more stressful.</p><p>Gameplay is fairly straightforward. Each bomb has different modules with traps that can&apos;t be solved without the manual. One example: you see a module with five wires and tell your friends. They check the manual and ask you questions. Depending on the color and number of the wires, you&apos;ll need to cut a specific wire. Get it wrong, and you get a strike (three strikes equals BOOM).</p><p>If you&apos;re trying to get your reluctant family members or roommates to try VR — and they find Beat Saber too intimidating — Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a great starting point. The gameplay is accessible and compelling, and the cartoonish vibes make it fun instead of overly serious. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>Relax as you build and expand cities in your virtual toybox</strong></p><p>Your goal in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/little-cities-quest-game-of-the-week">Little Cities</a> is simple: Build municipal districts on six different islands, unlocking new buildings and expanded real estate if you keep your little citizens happy with proper city structure. While there&apos;s "strategy" you need to follow to succeed as a city-builder, the stakes are much lower than in other stressful experiences. If a city isn&apos;t shaping up like you hoped, you can always take things apart and start over. </p><p>This game doesn&apos;t have complex, game-changing mechanics. However, compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/cities-vr-review">Cities: VR</a>, a city-building sim that struggled to translate its complex mechanics so they&apos;d work well with Touch controllers, Little Cities&apos; gameplay is comfortingly simple and works well with hand tracking alone. </p><p>As our reviewer described the game, it&apos;s "unabashedly joyful," with "vibrant colors" and cheerful mechanics like fireworks that go off whenever you level up. If you need a "sugary, candy-coated piece of escapism," this is your game. Plus, it&apos;s already seen its first paid DLC, Snowy Islands, which adds new islands, buildings, attractions, and natural disasters so your little cities stay fresh and fittingly seasonal. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p>Many PC gamers love the 2020 release Medieval Dynasty which managed to carve out a popular niche for itself by combining a first-person action game and a strategy game into one holistic package. The VR release on the Meta Quest platform doesn&apos;t just attempt to port this experience into a VR perspective, it totally rebuilds the experience in a way that is built-for-VR.</p><p>Like the flatscreen version, Medieval Dynasty New Settlement tasks players with surviving the harsh lifestyle of a medieval peasant. The game begins with you finding a new town to settle down in. You&apos;ll scavenge for food and water, harvest and hunt the land&apos;s resources, and make friends with people in the village. Once you build your first house, things greatly expand and the strategy aspect of the game really comes into play.</p><p>Unlike most other strategy games on the platform, Medieval Dynasty New Settlement sees you walking around and doing everything with your hands. From chopping the wood to building the house, cooking the bricks, chopping the food, bartering with townsfolk, etc. It&apos;s very hands-on.</p><p>Eventually, you&apos;ll grow your town into a city and then a "medieval hub," as the description puts it, creating a true dynasty as the name of the game suggests. Co-op modes and other improvements like better fast travel systems are coming soon, too, and the game&apos;s developers have shown that they&apos;re committed to the Quest release for the foreseeable future. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>For all the John Wicks out there</strong></p><p>From the moment the first trailer dropped for Pistol Whip, I was fully on board. John Wick in VR? What&apos;s not to love about that?</p><p>It&apos;s a simple concept, really: pull the trigger in time to the beat. Of course, problems arise when the bad guys shoot back, and pillars block your way, so the game fast becomes an aerobic exercise of side lunges, squats, and other shenanigans as you fight to stay alive. When you first start playing, the rhythm part of the game is hard to get into, but as you get used to the enemies&apos; movement, you will start to hit some big scores.</p><p>Since launch, we&apos;ve seen two new campaign expansions: the futuristic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pistol-whip-2089-review">Pistol Whip 2089</a> and the Old West <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pistol-whip-smoke-thunder-review">Pistol Whip: Smoke and Thunder</a>. Both are rather short story-wise but add new guns and varied challenges. The new Styles mode adds a massive amount of variety with challenging modifiers to old missions, like beating all the enemies without guns. Most recently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pistol-whips-encore-update-adds-new-scenes-party-mode-and-more">Encore update</a> added new modifiers and songs, along with a multiplayer Party Mode for competing with friends&apos; scores under specific conditions.</p><p>All in all, Pistol Whip is a fantastic game that truly shines on the Quest. The freedom to duck and weave without the constant concern for wires is very freeing, and the art style suits the power limitations of the Quest perfectly. I never feel sick playing, and there is never any frame rate slowdown, no matter how hectic it gets. If I could only play one game on the Meta Quest for the rest of time, it would be Pistol Whip. —<em>James Bricknell</em></p>

<p><strong>Clubbing on a Friday night has a whole new meaning</strong></p><p>Never been to a real racket club? I haven&apos;t either, but I feel like I have after putting several hours into Racket Club, the made-for-VR social game that makes it easy to find other players and get an amazing social experience at the same time.</p><p>Racket Club&apos;s gameplay is a fascinating mix between Pickleball and Racquetball, giving it a unique feel among other similar types of games. The game also supports passthrough, giving you full confidence that you won&apos;t smack something in your room on accident when you&apos;re really getting in on the action.</p><p>In Racket Club, you can opt to play through a robust single-player campaign or join a truly compelling multiplayer experience. The single-player mode is great for outfitting your character with fresh gear, but it&apos;s the multiplayer club that&apos;s the meat of this experience.</p><p>When you step out of the double doors of the clubhouse and into the courtyard, you&apos;ll find players roaming around looking for partners and opponents, alike. Each area has several Racket Club courts mixed between 1v1 and 2v2 sizes. You can walk right up to a court and jump in for practice, or just walk around chatting with people already playing a game.</p><p>The social experience Racket Club creates is nothing short of magic, and it&apos;s downright cathartic to see and hear everyone else playing and having a good time while you attempt to defeat your opponent. I always say VR is best when it&apos;s social, and this is the perfect VR social experience! — <em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Somehow, this third-person game plays better ported to first-person</strong></p><p>You can categorize this game as action, horror, or shooter, because it does well at all three. Resident Evil 4 masterfully converted the franchise from survival horror to a more action-packed experience (before 5 and 6 took things too far). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/resident-evil-4-vr-review">Resident Evil 4 VR</a> puts you in Leon&apos;s shoes, so when Ganados charge you with tentacles and chainsaws, it feels much more frightening than ever before. In the end, it&apos;s thanks to the new motion-control combat that shooting waves of foes feels incredibly satisfying, making VR the definitive way to play the classic game.</p><p>Whatever genre it fits, Resident Evil remains a blast to play all these years later. Armature Studios converted it to first-person, so you can grab weapons, healing herbs, grenades, or your combat knife without having to pull up a menu, making the gameplay more seamless than ever. New spatial audio warns you when enemies are approaching from out of sight. You pick up loot and ammo yourself, as well as reload your weapons as quickly as possible while enemies bear down on you. Even your companion, Ashley, received an AI upgrade for this revamped VR port.</p><p>Its graphics look a bit dated, but this benefits the game because it doesn&apos;t take up too much hard drive space while offering dozens of hours of gameplay. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/resident-evil-4-vrs-the-mercenaries-mode-out-now-in-free-update">Mercenaries Mode</a> — a horde mode in which you challenge waves of zombies as fan faves like Ada, Hunk, and Wesker — arrived as a free update with new tweaks and challenges. </p><p>Whether you&apos;re a fan of the classic game or haven&apos;t experienced it before, Resident Evil 4 works impressively well in virtual reality. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>An excellent puzzle mystery that challenges and intrigues.</strong></p><p>I unfairly ignored The Room VR for years, assuming from the name that it would be a run-of-the-mill horror game. Referencing the escape room genre and coming from a popular franchise of 2D puzzle games, The Room VR turned out to be a fascinating, graphically impressive experience that strikes a good balance between making its puzzles challenging and intuitive.</p><p>I could go into more detail about the game, but quite honestly, it&apos;s one that is best experienced without any spoilers and needs little introduction. It&apos;ll only last you about 5 hours or so, depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles, but don&apos;t let that dissuade you: it&apos;s short but very sweet. Plus, you can play several other The Room ports on Steam — though they&apos;re not available in VR, unfortunately.— <em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>It&apos;s like the first time you saw The Matrix, but you&apos;re Neo</strong></p><p>SUPERHOT isn&apos;t just some ordinary shooter in VR; it&apos;s a game that&apos;s been redesigned from the ground up with VR in mind, all while utilizing a concept that&apos;s wholly unique to SUPERHOT.</p><p>SUPERHOT VR takes place in the dungeon-like computer room of a hacker — you — who utilizes floppies and a VR headset to hack into some obfuscated system. While it&apos;s not directly explained, the story looks to be a direct extension of what you&apos;ll experience in other SUPERHOT games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/superhot-dlc-mind-control-delete-review">SUPERHOT: Mind Control Delete</a>. It has a main campaign and various challenge modes.</p><p>When you play it, you immediately understand what physical presence can lend to a concept like SUPERHOT. Sure, the base mechanics are the same — time moves when you move, so choose your movements wisely — but extending this concept to your actual body is what makes all the difference. When an enemy shoots at you, you can simply <em>stop moving your arms</em> to freeze time to a crawl and ponder how to escape the wave of bullets approaching you.</p><p>SUPERHOT VR doesn&apos;t just make you feel like Neo from The Matrix; it makes you feel utterly invincible. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>The best serious workout option on Quest</strong></p><p>The biggest question most people have (once they realize Supernatural isn&apos;t a horror game) is whether it&apos;s worth the subscription cost after the 14-day free trial. It used to cost $179/year, so the current price of $9.99/month or $99/year is comparatively cheap...but still expensive compared to Apple Fitness+ or Fitbit Premium (both $79/year).</p><p>What are you paying for? For starters, you get access to recorded coach-led daily workouts that give you advice and encouragement during each new routine. Different workouts target specific muscle groups and have different intensity levels or different types of music to encourage you. Unless the vague electronica soundtracks or paid DLC you get with most games, all content is available with the subscription.</p><p>The gameplay is extremely similar to Beat Saber, but the app tracks specific metrics, like the force and extension of your arm thrusts or the depth of your squats, as a way to track your progress. You can connect your fitness tracker, so your heart rate is associated with the workout. And during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/should-you-use-oculus-quest-2-for-fitness">Quest fitness testing</a>, Supernatural burned more calories than any other Quest game, making it extremely effective. </p><p>In more recent years, Supernatural added a mixed-reality mode for Quest 3 users who want to keep their eye on kids or pets while working out. And if you have friends with Quests and want to hold each other accountable, you can play the Supernatural Together mode and perform the same workout simultaneously, knowing people will see your swipes and scores at the end to keep you motivated. Overall, if you&apos;re at all interested in VR exercise, I&apos;d say Supernatural is worth the cost. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>Great humor, tons of varied minigames, and brain-teasing puzzles</strong></p>
<p>We decided to group these two, not because they didn&apos;t deserve their own spots individually but because anyone who enjoys one will immediately want to invest in the other. Both games are set in a near-future dystopia where most of humanity has been replaced by robots who are now trying to recreate "jobs" and "vacations" to make the remaining humans happy — but are pretty bad at figuring out the specifics.</p><p>Like a smart Pixar movie, these games have bright, cartoonish visuals and easy-to-grasp tasks that kids will enjoy while also employing smart jokes that&apos;ll get the biggest laughs out of adults. Some games have you complete tasks, solve puzzles, or design silly creations with the tools around you. Kids are encouraged to get creative, while anyone can hunt down secrets or waste hours on minigames. And the writing plays off of real-life in truly hilarious ways, especially in the free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/vacation-simulator-back-job-made-me-laugh-until-i-cried">Vacation Simulator: Back to Job expansion</a>.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a game to start with, Vacation Simulator is a more complete and technically advanced experience. For the kids, Vacation Simulator has multiple saves and a "small human" mode that ensures the gameplay happens at the proper height for them. It also adds hand tracking, where Job Simulator relies on the Touch controllers to be your hands. And while Job Simulator keeps its gameplay focused on the arc directly in front of you, Vacation Simulator takes full advantage of wireless VR and encourages you to look in any direction. Still, Job Simulator is a great introduction to VR and a fun experience in its own right. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>Post-apocalyptic New Orleans is a veritable hellscape</strong></p>
<p>The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walking-dead-saints-sinners-oculus-quest-review">Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</a> was a marvel of a game. Chapter 2 takes everything that was good about the original and turns it up to 11, giving you free rein of a post-apocalyptic New Orleans day <em>and</em> night — that’s an improvement over the original in which you could only traverse the streets during the day. Not only that, but your humble school bus abode has been expanded into the nearby crypts with shelves upon shelves filled to the brim with weapons, usable scraps, food, and just about anything you could want to get a good adventure started.</p><p>TWD S&S Ch 2 launched in November 2022 with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walking-dead-sands-chapter-2-is-proof-that-big-games-shouldnt-be-rushed">bevy of bugs</a> that made it literally impossible to play. We even delayed our full review until the developer could iron things out since we couldn’t progress beyond a game-breaking bug early on in the game. But, after a month of patches and updates, the game is better than ever and even more impressive than the first entry, utilizing the power of the Quest 2 to bring about more detailed environments and brand-new gibbing mechanics that’ll have you satisfyingly slicing through zombies in different ways each time just to see what happens.</p><p>Ch 2 takes the story portion of this action RPG to new heights. You’ll find more detailed dialog trees to choose from, multiple branching paths to explore, and what feels like a million new things to craft and find. It’s still got a bit of that weird physics jank that games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bonelab-review-the-new-standard-for-vr-physics-based-games">Bonelab</a> suffer from but, so long as the occasional glitch or oddity doesn’t bug you too much, it’s a rewarding experience that’ll have you wondering why more VR games aren’t so in-depth.</p><p>If you’re a Walking Dead superfan and absolutely must experience every last drop of the universe, the original Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners is still well worth playing. Otherwise, don’t worry too much about jumping headfirst into Ch 2. You’ll get a quick recap of the first game’s story at the beginning — including a lovely boat ride detailing the history of what happened in New Orleans after the zombies took over — and the game takes all the areas from the first and adds to them rather than fully replacing them. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p>Shooters in VR can be different from the usual FPS and tactical shooters you see on consoles. You may be a soldier, powerful cyborg, or deadly spy, but using motion controls makes each shot more deliberate and trickier to pull off than with a controller or mouse.

<p><strong>The new standard for VR physics-based games</strong></p><p>VR enthusiasts — especially ones who don’t have access to a powerful gaming PC — have been wondering how Boneworks developer Stress Level Zero could possibly port the physics-heavy action-adventure game to the Quest 2’s meager hardware. Well, wonder no more as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bonelab-review-the-new-standard-for-vr-physics-based-games"><u>Bonelab</u></a> is the spiritual successor to Boneworks and includes not just the same ground-breaking physics engine as the PC VR title, but also improvements based on years of user feedback, as well.</p><p>To preface things, Bonelab is a game that’s only made for VR gamers who have no issues with motion sickness at all. That’s because the game eschews standard comfort mechanics for something far more visceral and interactive than most games would ever allow. Your virtual body will get tossed about the many narrative-driven levels and you will even unlock the ability to switch characters on-the-fly, choosing from dozens of pre-built and user-made avatars. Each avatar has its own size and abilities, even including a giant creature that would put fear into the heart of a Rancor from Star Wars.</p><p>While Bonelab features hours of narrative-driven content that will see players delving through medieval dungeons, infiltrating a modern-day facility with modern-day weapons, and even fighting void zombies and head crabs bent on pulling you even further into VR, the game really shines with its custom content. An in-game mod browser can be used to easily download user and developer-created content and play to your hearts content. Given the size of the Boneworks community and its fervor to mod games, there’s little doubt that Bonelab will be fun to play for years to come. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Duck and cover!</strong></p><p>Fans of arcade lightgun games absolutely need to try Crisis Brigade 2 Reloaded. Originally found on SideQuest and then App Lab, this VR arcade shooter has finally made it to the official store. Unlike the first title, which has very cartoony graphics and some extremely light-hearted humor, the second entry goes for a much more realistic aesthetic. This is the kind of lightgun game that you’ve been missing since arcades mostly went belly-up 15 years ago. It would comfortably sit alongside classics like House of the Dead and Time Crisis.</p><p>The difference is that you’re <em>in</em> the environment this time, not just standing in front of a giant arcade cabinet. Make sure to get some friends to pick up a copy so you can play alongside them because there’s nothing like rescuing the (ex) President while shooting it out in a Matrix-style lobby scene with friends. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p>While Espire 1 filled a bizarrely empty gap in the Quest’s library — the stealth genre — the game wasn’t the best example of what a truly great stealth experience in VR could be. To get that, you needed a PC and a copy of Budget Cuts 1 or 2. Thankfully, Espire 2 is out and fixes almost all the flaws of the original, including a co-op mode that lets you stealth around with a human teammate.</p><p>Espire 2 picks up where the story of the first left off but don’t worry, they’ll give you a recap of what happened in the first and fill in the little details along the way. The story in Espire 2 is far more convincing and impressive than the first, presenting tasks that feel weightier and narrators that know not to bother you when you’re focused on sneaking around. It also introduces a new smaller robot husk that you’ll control, changing up the puzzles enough to make the game feel incredibly fresh.</p><p>Folks who enjoy Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell will most assuredly enjoy the game, although it feels a lot more <em>video gamey</em> than a realistic stealth sim would. In other words, if you loved the quirky humor and obvious video game mechanics of the first two Metal Gear Solid games, you’ll feel absolutely at home here. —<em> Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>It&apos;s the classic story of dark vs light in a fantasy WWI-era world</strong></p>
<p>Roguelikes have become an increasingly popular genre in VR for many reasons. Like other Roguelikes (or roguelites), The Light Brigade is a single-player game that weaves a light narrative (pun intended) into each gameplay session. There’s definitely an overarching story here that’s deeper than most VR roguelikes but the gameplay is still the primary driver of your daily play sessions.</p><p>The Light Brigade takes place in a truly interesting fantasy world filled with darkness and WWI-era weapons. Much of the game feels like a narrative allusion to the horrors of war, specifically Europe’s World Wars, and it’s through the player&apos;s actions and a sprinkling of prayer that will drive away the darkness inhabiting the world.</p><p>Players will wield WWI-era rifles and pistols which are enhanced by magic, powering through randomly-generated worlds that escalate in theme and difficulty. As with other roguelikes, you’ll traverse through the world as far as you can, earning temporary power-ups and collecting permanent currency until you die upon whence you’ll be whisked back to the home hub and be rebirthed to try, try again.</p><p>It’s both the theme and the visceral gameplay that makes The Light Brigade so good — and so addictive. It’ll have you coming back again and again not only to hone your skills and progress through the intriguing story but also to see what power-ups you can find and how much better your weapons can get. — <em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Spider-Man heads to the arcades</strong></p>
<p>Not all sequels are created equal, but Swarm 2 takes the high-flying arcade action from the original title and adds a brilliant roguelike progression system on top of it. Jump in (literally), swing like Spider-Man with your grappling tools, and eliminate the aliens invading Earth.</p><p>Swarm 2&apos;s gameplay loop is as addicting as it is exhilarating to play. You&apos;re launched into an arena teeming with aliens that spawn from random portals across the map. However, it&apos;s not a static shooting gallery; this is a very, very active game. Armed with grappling hooks and pistols, you must pull yourself every which way to avoid attacks and position yourself to strike back — performing aerial acrobatics that only make sense with room-scale VR technology.</p><p>Each level lasts only as long as you — or the enemies — can survive. Other levels offer movement challenges that test your ability to accurately grapple as fast as you can without falling to your doom. Power-ups and new weapons are found and earned during play, and you&apos;ll soon find yourself in a zen-like state of grappling, pulling, shooting, and dodging.</p><p>Plus, dying isn&apos;t the end. Like any good roguelike, points earned during matches can be used to upgrade your arsenal and powers so your next run can be even better than the last. Can you defeat the swarm and save the Earth? —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>After the fall, don't get left for dead</strong></p>
<p>If you&apos;re a fan of zombie shooters — especially the kind that throws hundreds of zombies at you — After the Fall is the game you need. In a broad sense, the game apes zombie shooter classics like Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor in the best of ways, creating an alternate-reality world where climate change in the &apos;80s messed all kinds of things up and frost zombies suddenly appeared to mop up whatever was left of human civilization.</p><p>The game leans heavily into the &apos;80s theme, as the hub where you start each play session is a 1980s arcade, complete with playable Oregon Trail hunting mini-game-inspired versions of Arizona Sunshine, the developer&apos;s previous VR title. Up to 32 players will walk amongst themselves in this lobby and can be invited to a party with a single click. </p><p>You&apos;ll be shooting hordes of zombies alongside three other players, or you can always opt to let the AI take over those player characters, instead. Either way, it&apos;s a four-person crew that&apos;ll be collecting floppies to unlock new gun components, gathering harvest from every downed zombie, and spending that harvest to better outfit yourself for the next, even more difficult level. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/after-fall-review">After the Fall review</a> gives you all the reasons you need to hop on right this minute. </p><p>Since launch, Vertigo Games has supported After the Fall with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/after-fall-will-add-horde-mode-and-new-maps-frontrunner-season">new horde mode</a>, several new maps, guns, enemies, and plenty other new content, all free. And given the developer supported Arizona Sunshine for several years, you can expect even more content to come with time. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Striking the balance between military realism and cartoonish fun</strong></p><p>When it comes to VR military shooters, two names lead the pack: Onward and Contractors. You can find Onward mentioned below but, if absolute realism and tight tactics aren’t quite your style, Contractors should be right up your alley. As you might assume from the name, you’ll play as a military contactor battling it out for supremacy of a map. Usually, that means the team with the most kills wins.</p><p>If you’ve played Call of Duty or Counter-Strike before, you’ll feel right at home here. The game features an impressive on-body inventory system that can be played with or without full-body physics modeling, and the game sports a bevy of accessibility features to make it easy to play for folks with all abilities and comfort levels. It’s also got the most accurate weapon modeling and reload mechanics of any game in its class that isn’t called Onward. You’ll regularly marvel at the quality of the gun models, from the World War 2-era weapons to modern-day rifles, and even ancient ninja swords and bows.</p><p>Yes, you read that right. Contractors doesn’t just give players the experience of modern-day combat, it also lets you choose from three additional gameplay styles: WW2, Ninja, and the new Zombies survival mode, as well. Up and coming games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/alvo-quest-hands-on"><u>Alvo</u></a> offer up more agile movement systems and a different take on the formula, but Contractors has been a fan favorite of VR fans for years and just keeps getting better.</p><p>Last and most certainly not least is the game’s easy modding capabilities, where players can design and upload their own maps and areas, complete with custom textures and everything you would expect. Yes, that means favorites from other consoles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/halo-vr-multiplayer-unofficially-comes-to-the-oculus-quest-2">Halo multiplayer</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-can-finally-play-star-wars-battlefront-on-the-oculus-quest-2">Star Wars Battlefront</a> — which will never <em>officially</em> come to Quest 2 — can be played without having to sideload. Just search (or browse) for what you want and hit play. All the downloading is handled automatically and all you have left to do is win. — <em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Get in, get the goods, and get out while you still can.</strong></p><p>Ghosts of Tabor is THE VR extraction shooter to play, with tons of different environments to explore, realistic weapons, survival mechanics, and an addictive gameplay loop that&apos;ll regularly keep you coming back for more.</p><p>Tabor quickly rose to popularity after a successful alpha test in early 2023, ushering in an epic round of funding and rapid development shortly after. Its official launch on the Meta Quest store in early 2024 ensured its player base would continue to grow and it&apos;s one of the most popular VR multiplayer shooters today because of its loyal community.</p><p>Players will start off in their own space, hunkered down in an underground bunker where they&apos;ll amass weapons and other gear after each survival run. Equip yourself with things you&apos;ll find and buy as you set off on your own or with squadmates to scavenge what you can from war-ravaged wastelands.</p><p>But be careful: when you die in Tabor, you lose everything you had. The game is no joke, and it rewards serious players who employ skill and strategy with epic loot that can be had no other way. While exploring, you can also accept jobs from different factions, earning credibility that&apos;ll later turn into better items from each group&apos;s shop.</p><p>Do you have what it takes to survive? — <em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>The uber-creative, Tribes-like multiplayer experience</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to argue with free, but Gun Raiders is compelling enough on its own. Sporting gameplay that feels straight out of the classic Starsiege: Tribes games from two decades ago, players will join in one of several different multiplayer modes that take part in thousands of different maps.</p><p>To top that off, players will fly around on jetpacks, climb any surface they set their minds to, and wield dozens of different weapons — including fantastical and semi-realistic guns and melee weapons.</p><p>If that level of variety wasn’t enough to get you interested, keep in mind that this game is <em>completely free to play</em> and doesn’t require players to watch adds or sign up for some dubious account. It’s got an in-game shop and a battle pass that’ll get players unique skins and other cosmetic items for a few bucks. The game has already been through four seasons of content as of late December 2022 and isn’t slowing down any time soon.</p><p>This one’s definitely a shooter everyone should try, if for no other reason than the fact that it’s free <em>— Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Turning battle royale on its head ... literally</strong></p>
<p>When Population: One first got announced in late summer 2020, I&apos;m pretty sure I heard a collective sigh from the VR community. "Do we really need another battle royale game?" was heard across forums far and wide, but developer Big Box VR proved most everyone wrong a few months later. Not only is the game one of the single-best battle royale games on any platform, but its mechanics are so well-tailored to VR that it doesn&apos;t make sense to play Population: One any other way.</p><p>If you&apos;re a fan of games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, or Call of Duty: Warzone, you&apos;ll feel immediately at home in the standard gameplay mode. Fly into a map and make sure you&apos;re the last one standing to win. The unique setup becomes apparent immediately since it doesn&apos;t take place on one floor. VR&apos;s unique level of freedom is fully explored in this game because it lets you climb anywhere — and I mean anywhere — and glide off said structures by simply extending your arms like you&apos;re wearing a wingsuit. It&apos;s doing to the battle royale formula what Breath of the Wild did for third-person adventure games.</p><p>Big Box VR has also supported the game in a way that&apos;s making players come back for more. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/population-one-season-1-hands">Season One</a> added a new War Mode, new weapons like a katana, and plenty of fresh skins. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/population-one-season-2-hands-on">Season Two</a> grew the map with a Western-themed area, threw in tons of new weapons, and grew the max player count to 24. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/population-one-season-3-hands-on-preview">Kingdom Age</a> season converted part of the map into a massive medieval castle, with new swords and tools to freshen things up. And the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/population-one-metropolis-update-hands-on">Metropolis</a> update gave the world a Blade Runner aesthetic.</p><p>After that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/population-one-sandbox-update-1000-new-maps-and-reasons-to-keep-playing" target="_blank">Sandbox expansion</a> added over 1,000 new deathmatch and team deathmatch maps at launch on December 14, 2022 and even includes a full-fledged level editor. That in-game level editor makes it easy for anyone to create and publish their own maps and even bring their friends along for the fun, spinning the game into an amazing place to create and hang out. Now, the game is fully free-to-play so players can enjoy the evolving map and gameplay options without the financial commitment.</p><p>Rest assured, if you want a game that gives you plenty of reasons to play regularly, Population: One is that game. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

Here are the best music and rhythm VR games for the Meta Quest.</p><p><strong>Rhythm games in best overall: </strong>Beat Saber, Pistol Whip</p>
<h2 id="audica-2">Audica</h2>

<p><strong>Giving target practice a whole new name (and a theme song)</strong></p>
<p>When Audica was first announced in early 2019, my first thought was, "Sweet! Beat Saber with guns!" Turns out, that&apos;s not a really accurate description, as it stands wholly on its own as a game that defines the "rhythm shooter" genre. After all, developer Harmonix is responsible for creating Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Central, and many more music games.</p><p>So what makes Audica so good? Think of it as the ultimate target practice game, but one where the targets appear to the beat of dozens of killer songs. Watching the trailer above will give you a cursory glance at just how badass playing Audica will make you feel. That&apos;s particularly true of the hardest two difficulty levels, which will challenge not just your speed and your aim, but also your rhythm and your ability to multitask like never before.</p><p>The one downside is that Audica hasn&apos;t gotten any new official songs in a long time. Luckily, it&apos;s similar enough to Osu!, a rhythm game on PC, that somebody made a mod that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/add-over-one-million-songs-audica-brilliant-osu-converter">converts Osu songs to Audica</a> with no need to modify anything. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>A 20-year-old game that turned out to be perfect for VR</strong></p><p>Android Central&apos;s team has been a fan of this game for so long that our original Rez Infinite review was for the Google Daydream. Originally a 2001 Dreamcast game, this game has been refreshed for new consoles repeatedly before finding its true calling in VR. This port reuses the same five levels from the original with updated graphics while adding a new Area X level that lets you freely explore the world, built specifically for VR.</p><p>This musical rail shooter is more of a relaxing, atmospheric game than most of our other rhythm picks, but that doesn&apos;t make experiencing it any less powerful. Over the course of a few hours, the electronic soundtrack gets increasingly intense, and the screen gets filled with color and explosions as you shoot more and more enemies — with the music reacting to your shots.</p><p>Launched on the same day as the Quest 2 itself, Rez Infinite takes full advantage of the headset&apos;s power and looks marvelous despite being an "old" game. Just make sure you understand this game isn&apos;t like Beat Saber and its imitators: It&apos;s a transformative VR experience that will last you a few hours in the main campaign, plus more time in Area X, but it doesn&apos;t necessarily have replay value. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>Air guitar? Nah, it&apos;s all about air drums now</strong></p>
<p>To say that Guitar Hero is one of the most influential game series of all time would be a massive understatement. And there&apos;s a reason that Guitar Hero was such a pop culture juggernaut for so many years — playing covers of classic rock songs with fake plastic instruments is just plain fun! </p><p>Guitar Hero and other games like it might be gone (for now, at least) but there are plenty of VR games to fill the gap. The one that most successfully captures that totally radical rockin&apos; vibe of Guitar Hero is, without a doubt, Smash Drums. </p><p>VR means not having to buy and store those expensive plastic controllers, and there are ton of fun visual effects as you drum your way through tunes. Guitar Hero might&apos;ve tested the dexterity of your fingers but Smash Drums will have you testing your ability to multitask as you jam on your drum kit. It&apos;s a blast! <em>- Nick Ransbottom</em></p>

<p><strong>Beat Saber's rhythm rival gives you a different kind of workout</strong></p>
<p>You can&apos;t help but compare Synth Riders to Beat Saber. Both games have you swipe the Touch controllers at colorful objects to the beat of a large original soundtrack, plus new DLC packs from famous bands. Each song has different difficulty levels, so you can challenge yourself once you master the basics. You must not only move your controllers to the right spots, but also move your whole body to dodge obstacles, giving yourself a whole-body workout.</p><p>Don&apos;t think of Synth Riders as just a Beat Saber clone. BS is all about swiping your controllers like sabers, faster and faster on harder difficulties. Synth Riders&apos; gameplay is more of a dance, with the game guiding your arms into constant circular motions that make you bob, weave, and turn in circles. It lets you get into a more natural rhythm and lose yourself in the music instead of violently slicing to the beat.</p><p>Synth Riders has a dedicated community, thanks in part to its cross-platform multiplayer and its active dev team. You can regularly find other people to compete against in real-time for different songs or join the weekly Saturday Synth Fever dance party. Where other Quest games feel like their devs have already moved on to other things, Synth Riders is one you can count on to get constant improvements and new songs. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>Giving a whole new meaning to air guitar</strong></p>
<p>As someone who&apos;s owned several Guitar Hero games and plastic accessories over the years, I&apos;ve waited impatiently for a game that would recapture the magic. That game is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unplugged-hands-preview">Unplugged</a>, which takes the colorful-buttons-as-strings concept and uses hand tracking instead of a controller to simulate guitar playing.</p><p>The issue with inside-out VR cameras for hand tracking is that these cameras don&apos;t have a great angle for seeing what your hands are doing when they&apos;re facing away from you. But Unplugged works well because your fingers mirror the grip around a guitar neck, making them easily visible directly in front of the Quest.</p><p>Lower difficulties let you get a handle on the controls but don&apos;t really match the music. But as you advance to higher levels and learn how to properly hold your fret hand and master cords, you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;re truly playing along to your classic rock favorites like Free Bird, The Kids Aren&apos;t Alright, Spirit in the Sky, and Say It Ain&apos;t So. And post-launch DLC added artists like Muse, Slayer, Rob Zombie, and Pantera to the mix.</p><p>It&apos;s not the kind of rhythm game most VR gamers would be into, but it&apos;s the kind of rhythm game that old-time gamers will love.—<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p>According to the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise, Beat Saber players have burned billions of calories since the game launched, probably without even noticing. VR games have a real scientific advantage to exercise because the total visual distraction and spatial audio combine to keep your mind too occupied to notice how hard it&apos;s working. Any random VR game can get you sweating, but these are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-games-give-you-real-workout" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-games-give-you-real-workout">best Meta Quest exercise games</a> for people who want to stay fit without stepping outdoors.</p><p><strong>Exercise games in best overall: </strong>Supernatural</p>

<p><strong>Super Punch Out meets Rocky in VR</strong></p>
<p>Creed: Rise to Glory strikes the sweet spot between the more realistic Thrill of the Fight and the cartoonish Knockout League. As the eponymous boxing phenom played by Michael B. Jordan, you&apos;ll enjoy a short campaign where you take on opponents with different skill sets and techniques as you rise to the top. The campaign is relatively short at just a few hours of hard-punching, but you can follow it up with freeplay bouts or PvP matches against online opponents.</p><p>We tested our original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/creed-rise-glory-review-my-body-hurts-and-i-love-it">Creed: Rise to Glory review</a> on the PSVR and Oculus Rift, but the core mechanics that we loved remain unchanged for the portable version. You&apos;re guided by Rocky Balboa himself as you learn boxing techniques and wear out your arms on a punching bag, then step into the ring. Unlike games where you just swipe your controllers wildly, this game has a stamina meter that will tire out your character if you throw too many punches — so you need to be strategic. Don&apos;t worry. You&apos;ll still be incredibly sore after a few matches.</p><p>Though we wish the story mode were much longer, it at least succeeds in making you feel like a bonafide boxing star. And when it comes to fighting online opponents, you can choose or play against Rocky franchise boxers like young Balboa, Apollo Creed, and Ivan Drago. These cameos make your fights feel more dramatic like you&apos;ve stepped into the classic films. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>Boxing and dancing workouts combined into one app</strong></p>
<p>FitXR (the developers) took its former game BoxVR — a challenging boxing workout simulator that we loved — and turned it into FitXR, adding dance workouts and more detailed workout metrics for a more complete app experience. So whether you prefer straightforward punching and weaving or a more natural rhythm experience, FitXR will absolutely get you sweating.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitxr-oculus-quest-2-review">FitXR for Oculus Quest 2 review</a>, we had tons of praise for the game&apos;s "immersive, futuristic, psychedelic experience"; the mix of motivational rock, dance, hip-hop, and electronic music that&apos;ll keep you in the zone; and the detailed statistics. Just keep in mind that if you want to actually track burned calories, invest in one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">best fitness trackers</a> since the in-game calorie counter generally overestimates how many calories you actually burn per workout.</p><p>In exchange for a monthly subscription, you get access to fresh daily workouts and new licensed music. Along with boxing and dancing, FitXR added new features like a HIIT Studio, simultaneous "multiplayer" workouts, and a training mode to justify the subscription. For new subscribers, this offers good content for a smaller monthly fee than Supernatural. For those who bought the $30 game and $10 DLC before everything switched to a subscription, you can still access purchased content and received a free 90-day sub-trial. But many still found this change frustrating.</p><p>More recently, FitXR received a mixed-reality mode, followed by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zumba-fitxr-makes-fitness-fun">great Zumba add-on</a> that makes VR workouts much more exciting. A dedicated workout app that&apos;s simultaneously fun and good for your body, FitXR is worth subscribing to if you&apos;re serious about indoor fitness. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>Get your groove on without fear of anyone watching.</strong></p><p>The name Les Mils is legendary in the home workout scene, so it makes sense that the suite of Les Mils games available on the Meta Quest platform would be worth taking a look at. While Les Mils Body Combat is a great title, we love Les Mils XR Dance because it&apos;s different from any other dancing game on the platform.</p><p>XR Dance is all about teaching you all different types of dance, from hip-hop to latin, EDM, and just about everything in-between. Real instructors show you how it&apos;s done and a clever system of colored trails and markers ensures that you know exactly where to put your hands and feat to get the highest scores.</p><p>Plus, once you&apos;re comfortable with any given dance, you can show off your skills to the world with the leaderboard.

<p><strong>The best sports game for effortless exercise</strong></p>
<p>For me, dedicated workout or boxing apps can sometimes feel too much like <em>work</em>. Even putting on the Quest 2 can feel like a time commitment. If you&apos;re like me, you should find an active sports app that prioritizes <em>fun</em>, with burned calories and sweat as a neat side effect.</p><p>In Racket: Nx, you stand in the center of a giant dome and use your racket to bounce a ball against different hexagonal tiles, some of which give you extra points when you hit them. You can ricochet balls across multiple hexes for combo scores if you aim properly, but until you master the controls (or if it&apos;s a younger kid playing), you can just have fun hitting the ball over and over and watching the resulting light show. You don&apos;t need to be as accurate as in something like a table tennis VR game, and in fact, this is the rare game that&apos;ll have you spinning in full circles as you track the ball until you fully lose track of your real-world surroundings.</p><p>The main gameplay is single-player, with a campaign and endless mode, but you can also play co-op or versus modes with other Oculus players. While I love the original soundtrack, I also appreciate the option to add my own custom music, which makes me want to spend more time swinging my racket and enjoying my favorite playlists. Simple but endlessly replayable with very accurate controls, Racket: Nx is a must-buy whether you care about VR exercise or not. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p>It&apos;s no surprise that the devs behind Racket: Nx followed up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/underdogs-meta-quest">Underdogs</a>, which we called "the best workout app of 2024" despite not being a true "exercise game." Like with that game, the action-packed, arm-swiping gameplay inadvertently helps you burn calories but keeps you so focused on the violent mecha action that you won&apos;t feel like you&apos;re working out.</p><p>Underdogs is a mech brawler/ roguelike with a compelling story that&apos;ll have you taking on the mech-fighting world again and again, getting beaten down but slowly improving your skills and upgrades from one run to the next. You move by pulling your mecha along, gorilla style, so you don&apos;t get any motion sickness. The art direction is fantastic and the action-packed gameplay is a blast. — <em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p>Some sports-themed games in VR might be exercise-focused — like Creed with its Endurance Update — while others are created purely to recreate a specific experience in VR.

<p><strong>It's seriously real table tennis</strong></p>
<p>Eleven is VR table tennis for table tennis enthusiasts. That doesn&apos;t mean amateurs like myself won&apos;t have fun, though — quite the contrary, actually — as the game truly feels like a realistic representation of the actual sport. Since a paddle weighs pretty close to the same amount as a Touch Plus controller, and a ping pong ball ways basically nothing, the vibrations from the controller felt when the ball hits the paddle feel real.</p><p>If that weren&apos;t enough, the ball moves and bounces in a way that feels wholly authentic and realistic. Despite the realism, some players might find that they need to adjust the bounciness, spin, or even the throw coefficient to fit their own personal style of play better. It&apos;s these bits of customization, complete with the realism of regular play, that makes Eleven Table Tennis stand out from the pack.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve faced off against the best AI in the game — opponents that don&apos;t feel robotic or cheap in any way — you can hop online and play against your friends or random players. Just watch out, though, because even professional table tennis players agree this is the real deal, so you might just run into one of them in your online forays.

<p><strong>The ultimate Golf game, no matter what kind of golf you like.</strong></p><p>GOLF+ includes tons of world-famous courses, including Pebble Beach, Pinehurst No. 2, and Valhalla, which will let you feel like a real professional taking on tough holes. And If that isn&apos;t enough, the Pro Putt minigolf course lets players take to a full putting course — complete with sand traps and other obstacles — to take their putting game to the next level.</p><p>But what if you&apos;re not a fan of traditional golf? That&apos;s where the Topgolf portion of the game comes in.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever been to a real-world Topgolf location, you know how much fun it can be. Grab a drink, take a seat, and shoot for the best score with friends or family and have a great night out. But what if you don&apos;t have a location near you or don&apos;t have anyone close by to play with? The Quest version of Topgolf, now renamed GOLF+, is an incredible recreation of the experience, complete with perfect 8-player multiplayer functionality and even some great hats to wear during the experience.</p><p>Just like real-world Topgolf, you&apos;ll be hitting golf balls toward a uniquely shaped target that surrounds a traditional golf pin. Play for the best score, or shoot further out to see if you can nail some huge points while still getting close to the pin. Is the experience more about playing golf or hanging out with friends?

<p><strong>Do you have what it takes to be a star quarterback?</strong></p>
<p>When the first NFL Pro Era was released, it was the first licensed NFL game on the Quest 2, which was a big deal. Football isn&apos;t exactly one of the more popular sports to adapt to VR, especially compared to something like tennis. But rather than going the route of the Madden console games, NFL Pro Era plants you firmly in the role of quarterback.</p><p>It was a fun but flawed experience.

What players already liked about the first game is still there but there&apos;s a lot more to do. Most notably, there&apos;s a new Coach&apos;s Confidence mechanic that will let you unlock more play options as you earn confidence points with your coach during games.</p><p>More importantly, multiplayer has been properly implemented this time around.

Turns out that feeling was right: Nock is a fantastic experience that could just as easily fit in the Exercise and Sports categories; be prepared to work yourself into a sweat and rely on teamwork and strategy to win the day.</p><p>Nock has a straightforward premise — shoot the ball into the opponent&apos;s goal while defending your own — but you&apos;ll need to master more than just aiming at a moving target while moving yourself. You&apos;ll also need to master movement through the arena and up walls, which can get tiring, as well as figure out how to properly deploy and orient block arrows. </p><p>With a ton of replay value for the low price, Nock is undoubtedly one of the best Meta Quest games you can play. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>A relaxing trip without the long commute</strong></p>
<p>Who wants to wake up before the crack of dawn just to drive somewhere and sit for hours at a time? Not me, that&apos;s for sure. While fishing is supposed to be a relaxing way to spend your time, it&apos;s hard to think of something less relaxing than getting out of your bed at 4 a.m. on a weekend.

You just won&apos;t be able to eat what you catch after you&apos;re done.</p><p>Real VR Fishing ranks among the most consistently updated games you&apos;ll find on the platform. Aside from being one of the very first games to receive big graphics upgrades on the Quest 2 when it launched, the developers have regularly updated it with new areas, new fish, new clothes to wear in the game, and all sorts of other goodies to earn while fishing.</p><p>It&apos;s also got a really fascinating in-game "tablet" of sorts that lets you browse the web, watch youtube, or even just listen to music on your favorite streaming service while you play.

<p><strong>Caesar hopes you are thoroughly entertained</strong></p>
<p>For years, GORN has been the darling child of VR gamers who wanted to relive the days of the Roman gladiators. But GORN, in all its glory, is a pretty shallow game that stops being fun the moment you’ve exhausted all the gruesome ways to kill your enemies. Thankfully, Barbaria came along and not only honed in all the great parts of GORN’s combat system but also added some brains to the equation.</p><p>Barbaria is an “asynchronous multiplayer game” which means that your actions in the game are “recorded” and played back for other players. In this case, you’ll be assaulting other players’ bases and attempting to get through their defenses to capture the power crystals scattered throughout. Your earnings from these raids will allow you to earn and purchase defenses for your own realm which, you guessed it, will get raided by other players when you’re not playing.</p><p>This makes Barbaria a fascinating mix of action, fighting, puzzle, and tower defense. Any time you raid another player’s base — or complete one of the story levels created by the developers — you can take first-person control of your barbarian or zoom out and control things from a bird’s eye view, and even use magic as a huge demi-god to turn the tide of battle.</p><p>Like GORN, Barbaria is brutal and often grotesque, earning that M rating every time you chop a goblin’s head off and attach it to the end of your war axe. The physics-based combat works incredibly well and the weapons never feel overly heavy or light. You&apos;ll also be regularly surprised at how enemies can interact with the environment, both with their own actions and by being thrown into something clever.</p>

<p><strong>The robots have finally taken over</strong></p>
<p>You might just be a paper-pusher at TransCorp, but you quickly find out that you&apos;re seemingly the last human working at the massive conglomeration. One day, you receive a mysterious call at your desk that you&apos;re the next — and last — to go. Armed with only your teleportation gun and whatever "letter openers" you can find lying around, you must sneak your way up to the top of the building to discover what happened to your fellow colleagues and stop a dastardly plan to erase humans.</p><p>Budget Cuts was one of the first VR games to take advantage of roomscale VR movement. It does stealth better than any other VR game, even if some of the mechanics feel a tiny bit dated compared to more recent releases like Espire 2. After all, this is a Quest port of PCVR games that came out several years ago when VR headsets were tethered to expensive PCs and controllers were far simpler.</p><p>In the first half — which is actually the first Budget Cuts game — you&apos;ll traverse through office buildings, hide behind (and under) desks, and crawl through air vents. The sense of presence in this building is unparalleled, and you&apos;ll soon find yourself sticking your face on your floor to peer down through the ceiling in the game. It&apos;s wild.</p><p>The second half takes the formula to new heights with bigger environments, more weapons, and even scarier robots. You&apos;ll also finally figure out who that voice is on the other side of the phone — a twist I certainly didn&apos;t see coming.</p><p>Budget Cuts Ultimate is a perfect port of a near-perfect VR game and includes additional ways to play once you beat the story. Mutators modify the gameplay and add significant replay value to an already pair of incredible games, and Budget Cuts Arcade provides interesting side missions that score you based on your stealthiness. Can you get the highest score? —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>This roguelite is a heavenly romp through the gates of Hell</strong></p>
<p>When it launched on the PC as In Death in 2018, many players proclaimed it their favorite VR game. Unfortunately, developer Sólfar Studios couldn&apos;t keep it updated and later transferred the rights to Superbright, which now runs the Quest version of the title. The subtitle of In Death: Unchained is a duality in itself, referring both to the freeing nature of untethered VR that&apos;s brought about on the Quest platform and the never-ending quest in the game to top the leaderboards with ever-improving skills.</p><p>Like most roguelites, In Death: Unchained features a procedurally generated world that&apos;s never quite the same round after round. Set in three main areas of a godless afterlife, players will find themselves fighting through levels with a bow as their main weapon and the ability to fight melee if the need arises. The bow isn&apos;t just used to kill enemies, though; it&apos;s also an excellent means of traversal, thanks to a special arrow that works as a teleportation device. Skilled players will use this movement in tandem with free-moving joystick controls to outsmart enemies and bosses alike, all with gorgeous visuals and compelling boss fights.</p><p>In Death: Unchained, unlike its predecessor, has been updated and even overhauled several times now to change things up and keep the action fresh for veteran players. The move to seasonal content has also proven quite successful for the game and its players. In fact, it was among the first batch of games that was heavily updated to support the Quest 2&apos;s enhanced processing power, a testament to Superbright&apos;s dedication to the game. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Take to the skies and become an avenger!</strong></em></p><p>VR is all about letting you go to places or be someone you could never be in real life. That&apos;s exactly why Iron Man VR is so dang amazing! Many Quest games will transport you to another place or time, but few games are able to make you feel like a completely different person altogether.</p><p>Embody Tony Stark and don the famous Iron Man suit in this action-adventure game that spans 8-10 hours with an original story and movie-quality voice acting and script writing. There&apos;s nothing quite like Tony&apos;s one-liners, and you&apos;ll hear plenty of quips and puns along with snarky replies as you make your way through the story. And don&apos;t worry, there are plenty of things to unlock and upgrade, including new suit abilities and entirely different suits altogether.</p><p>Iron Man VR&apos;s controls are wholly unique, as well. You&apos;ll be using each controller to propel yourself around each level with Iron Man&apos;s palm-mounted rocket thrusters, giving you the real feeling of flying anywhere you want. When you&apos;re not on a mission you can chill at Tony&apos;s bougie Malibu home and tinker around in the garage with the Iron Man suit thanks to your AI companion Gunsmith and his brilliant inventions. But will they be enough to stop the Ghost? You owe it to yourself to find out! —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/until-you-fall-review" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/until-you-fall-review">Until You Fall</a> is a unique take on the hack-and-slash roguelite genre. Taking thematic elements from high-fantasy epics like Lord of the Rings and injecting it with a thick serum of Tron-like neon highlights, Until You Fall will have your jaw on the floor with its stylistic beauty, up until the moment the first enemy makes you drop to the floor. Then, as the name implies, you&apos;ll battle your way through enemy after enemy until you fall. Then, you respawn back in the hub to upgrade your character and do it all over again.</p><p>Until You Fall utilizes seriously realistic physics modeling that makes you feel like you&apos;re actually swinging the weapons you wield. There&apos;s something trippy about feeling like you&apos;re fighting with a giant neon-drenched ax, and Until You Fall nails that feeling with every single swing and block. Enemies will ruthlessly attack you in groups, and the end of each section brings the choice of one randomized power-up to reward you with.</p><p>Players will make their way through dozens of levels, separated by three tiers of difficulty, color, and enemy types, battling bosses at the end and collecting Aether. This ethereal currency is used to make those weapons even more brutal, giving you the edge in battle — once you muster up enough patience, that is. The question is, which part of you will fall first, your mind or your body? Until You Fall will challenge both. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p>Virtual reality is the perfect medium for horror games. Normally you can turn off the lights and try to make your home as horror-filled as possible, but there&apos;s still some objective distance between you and the screen. In VR, the monsters and nightmares are just an inch from your eyes, and there&apos;s no way to avert your gaze. The Meta Quest 2 and 3 have some genuinely frightening and fun horror VR games, but these are the first games you should try.</p><p><strong>Horror games in best overall: </strong>Five Night&apos;s at Freddy&apos;s Help Wanted, Walking Dead Saints & Sinners</p>

<p><strong>The long-awaited sequel to a VR zombie shooter classic — now with more doggo.</strong></p>
<p>Many VR gamers&apos; first VR FPS shooter/ horror game was Vertigo Games&apos; Arizona Sunshine. It took about seven years for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/arizona-sunshine-2-review">Arizona Sunshine 2</a> to amble its way onto the Quest 3 at a zombie-like pace. In many ways, it was worth the wait.</p><p>Fans of the original will love Arizona Sunshine 2. It retains the dark comedy essence of the first, complete with excellent dialog and one-liners. There&apos;s little funnier than the ramblings of a man who somehow survived the apocalypse and has gone a little crazy without other humans to talk to.</p><p>Like the original, Arizona Sunshine 2 has a core single-player experience, two-player co-op, and a four-player horde mode. That adds some important replayability, since the main game will probably take 6 hours or so, plus extra time for collectibles. </p><p>You do have new elements like a crafting mechanic and new weapons. But the biggest update to the sequel is Buddy, a dog companion who you can order to attack zombies or pick up nearby items. You can use him to stealthily take out zombies before they&apos;re alerted to your presence, or have him detect when a "dead" zombie is really biding its time. And you can store extra guns on his back, so you don&apos;t have to commit to one or two options.—<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Making dinosaurs scary again</strong></p>
<p>I was still in elementary school when the first Jurassic Park movie came out, and I&apos;ll never forget the wonder and horror that ensued. The concept was so fresh, and the dinosaurs were absolutely terrifying; the latter, in particular, was a concept that none of the many sequels captured. The many tense moments in that kitchen scene alone can be felt throughout the entirety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/jurassic-world-aftermath-review" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/jurassic-world-aftermath-review">Jurassic World Aftermath</a>.</p><p>You (stupidly) take a job to recover some lost data on good old Isla Nublar — two years after the fall of Jurassic World, might I add — and predictably crash land when a group of Pteranodons obliterates your aircraft. Once you make it to the facility, you realize the raptors are still hanging around and are ready to play cat and mouse with you while you are just trying to escape for your life.</p><p>Like any good stealth survival horror game, Jurassic World Aftermath makes you feel totally helpless against these creatures. There are no weapons and no real way to defend yourself. You just have a wrist-mounted gadget that can be used to activate old electronics remotely, along with a series of lockers, desks, and other debris to hide yourself in during the adventure. It&apos;s an astounding sensation of fear that&apos;s primal in nature and nearly flawless in execution. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/jurassic-world-aftermath-part-2-review">Jurassic World Aftermath Part Two</a> gives you more of the same story, scares, and gameplay, clearing up the first part&apos;s cliffhanger and adding new dinos and puzzles to keep things fresh. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Forget survival; this is pure horror</strong></p>
<p>If you&apos;re a fan of Japanese horror manga, you&apos;ve likely heard of names like Junji Ito and Shintaro Kago. If you&apos;ve not heard of these names, go ahead and Google their work — you&apos;ll immediately understand what you&apos;re about to undertake in Lies Beneath, a survival horror game inspired by these works. From the comic book style to the onomatopoeia that flies around the screen as you run, shoot, and kill, Lies Beneath will immediately transport you to a world gone wrong and completely upend your sense of reality.</p><p>Lies Beneath is a first-person survival horror that&apos;ll have you trekking through the woods and deeper into madness as you recover from the ashes of a fiery car crash. The demons you encounter could be real or just a figment of your imagination, but they&apos;re no less deadly regardless of their otherworldly appearance. You&apos;ll have to be savvy and sneaky on your journey if you&apos;re to avoid being overwhelmed, both by enemies and the thoughts that constantly grow louder in your mind.</p><p>Few games master the feeling of panic that Lies Beneath delivers. The game was developed with Meta Quest in mind, and, amazingly enough, all the character models were created completely in VR using Medium by Adobe. That&apos;s important since VR can give you an understanding of scale like no other visual medium can, and creating the enemies you face solely in VR has allowed the team to make models that are more convincing than what you&apos;ll find in other games. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

You want to kill a vampire ensconced safely in its coffin. To do so, you must disarm the protective traps, find and reassemble relics to bind the vampire, and find its weak point to stake, all without alerting it to your presence. </p><p>It feels like a more in-depth and murderous version of the classic board game Operation. The Quest has plenty of action-horror and straight-up horror experiences with some puzzles tacked on, but this feels like the rare experience where puzzles are naturally baked into the experience, and become more tense than usual because of the setting and stakes. </p><p>Rest assured that this is a <em>scary</em> experience. Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire has plenty of jumpscares, and you should be ready to fail over and over before you manage to succeed.

<p><strong>You thought death was scary? Wait until you see what's after.</strong></p>
<p>When I first played Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife as part of a hands-on event in March, I really only had an inkling of how scary the game could be. Turns out, the final version (check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wraith-oblivion-afterlife-review" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/wraith-oblivion-afterlife-review">Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife review</a>) is <em>considerably</em> scarier than I could&apos;ve imagined. There are few words to describe the feeling of dread the game paints at every corner, and you&apos;ll be turning quite a few of them as you roam the halls, rooms, and courtyards of the massive Barclay Mansion.</p><p>Wraith is set in the World of Darkness universe, including games like Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, and others. In Wraith, you play as a photographer that woke up dead one day and found himself trapped in the last place he was still alive: Barclay Mansion. As you roam the halls, you&apos;ll unravel the story of what happened, narrated by a very dead, very scary shadow of your former self. You&apos;ll quickly find out that everyone was a part of a mysterious seance, led by a woman tasked with calling upon the dead to heal the owner of the mansion. But, in true horror fashion, something went terribly wrong, and everyone was brutally murdered — or were they?</p><p>Along the way, you&apos;ll find spectres destined to rip and tear you to pieces if they spot you, and you&apos;ve got no good defense against them. Thankfully, you do have the special powers only bestowed upon a Wraith at the time of death — powers you&apos;ll only earn as you progress through the story.

<p><strong>Tetris no longer has a monopoly on colored shapes</strong></p>
<p>When you think of puzzlers, your brain almost indelibly goes to Tetris. The catchy tunes and hypnotizing movement of the pieces are only broken by the speed you have to keep up to win. So what if you took Tetris and made it decidedly more zen? That&apos;s maybe a semi-decent description of Cubism, a 3D puzzler that only makes sense in VR space, as it makes you feel like you&apos;re picking up physical colorful shapes and trying to fit them into another hollow shape.</p><p>What seems like a straightforward formula at first makes way for a brain-teasingly good time that&apos;s earned the game a nearly flawless score on the Oculus Store — and earned it many awards in the process. There&apos;s nothing quite like getting lost in the zone of solving puzzles only to find yourself emerge from VR a few hours later. Later puzzles are deceptively difficult, especially given the ease at which the game pulls you in.</p><p>It&apos;s truly the perfect example of a pick-up-and-play VR game since you can jump in for a few minutes at a time. Built-in hand-tracking support is fun and lends credence to this feeling; plus, with the recent update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-2-hand-tracking-presence-platform">hand tracking 2.0</a>, Cubism should control much more naturally than before without controllers.</p><p>Either way, pick it up.

<p><strong>In space, no one can hear you scream... when you can't solve that puzzle</strong></p>
<p>What could be a more perfect setup for roomscale VR than a giant do-it-yourself Rube Goldberg machine? A giant do-it-yourself Rube Goldberg machine in space with zero-gravity! Gravity Lab was one of the first roomscale games on PC VR platforms back in 2016 and received a marvelous port to the Oculus Quest.</p><p>Gravity Lab puts players in a defunct Moonbase that was clearly used for some weird science experiments. Are you supposed to be here? Are you part of the experiment? There&apos;s only one way to find out: Get to solving those puzzles so you can move on to the next! Most puzzles involve getting some ball or another item from one point to the next, but the limited number of pieces you can use make it a challenge.</p><p>After the first few levels, you&apos;ll have to really start thinking out of the (gravity) box as puzzles begin to increasingly evolve into ones that don&apos;t rely on gravity. The clever puzzles are injected with humor to spice things up a bit, and the simple narrative helps carry players from one level to the next without getting convoluted. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Relax and assemble real-life locations scanned into 3D puzzles. </strong></p>

I thought I would miss the tactile sensation of the pieces and the camaraderie of puzzling with others. But it turned out to be one of my absolute favorites, and doesn&apos;t require me to hunch over a coffee table to see the pieces as I work!</p><p>The base game has 17 puzzles — plus a ton of DLC with new temples, churches, fountains, and other cool locales and monuments from around the world — and each puzzle is split into different difficulty levels at 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 pieces. You can start with a smaller number and then jump into the hundreds for an entirely new challenge. You&apos;ll put together bundles of pieces and then set them aside so you can reserve the main area in front of you for the next matching set. And as you put pieces together, real-world spatial audio of that location will start to play, immersing you in the place you&apos;re creating. </p><p>Many of our Quest 2 favorites work best for gamers with their "VR legs" but can be nauseating for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-quest-games-avoid-motion-sickness">first-time Quest users</a>.

<p><strong>More than just the best graphics on the Quest 2. It&apos;s smart AND creative!</strong></p>
<p>Tired of VR games with simplistic graphics or cartoony visuals? Want to see the best the Quest 2 hardware can do? Then Red Matter 2 is for you. The developers at Vertical Robot proved that they could work magic with the original Red Matter, but Red Matter 2 is on another dimensional plane altogether. This game has the best visuals you’ll find on the Quest 2, bar none. They even, somehow, managed to get the Quest 2 to do ray-tracing, which is something usually only found on far more powerful consoles or PCs.</p><p>Now, while the visuals will certainly suck you in, the gameplay will keep you in the game for a long time, especially if you’re a fan of classic adventure titles. You’ll play as the same Atlantic Union agent as in the first game but, this time, you’re on a quest to find a long-lost friend whom you thought was dead. While you’ll be solving plenty of intricate puzzles that’ll have you scratching your noggin time and time again, Red Matter 2 ups the ante by adding in combat situations.</p><p>In addition to combat, players now have access to a jetpack that can propel them through zero-gravity situations and on gravity-heavy space stations. That gives players even more freedom of movement than they had in the original, which would often have you moving between areas in pre-determined paths. It’s an upgrade over the original, yet doesn’t lose any of the charm. Just make sure to play the original first — or watch a play-through on YouTube — if the story really matters to you. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>A party to die for</strong></p>
<p>When The 7th Guest originally came out in the early 90s, it was revolutionary — at the time, Bill Gates himself declared it to be the new standard in interactive entertainment. The 7th Guest was one of the first games to be available only on CD-ROM, which is one of the many reasons it&apos;s so influential. </p><p>Today, it&apos;s probably best remembered for the campy, chroma-keyed FMV sequences and playfully macabre puzzles. Does it hold up well? That&apos;s debatable. But regardless, there&apos;s now a VR remake <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-7th-guest-vr-is-a-party-worth-crashing">and it&apos;s fantastic</a>. </p><p>This new take on The 7th Guest completely revamps the game for VR. The environments look gorgeous, the new puzzles are challenging and make great use of VR, and it even keeps the iconic FMVs by using new actors with volumetric video technology.

Successful block-breaking leads to explosions of color across the screen. The Tetriminos descend to match the music&apos;s rhythm, and everything combines to make the experience feel magical, and that effect&apos;s only compounded in VR.</p><p>The newest feature is called Zone, which freezes falling blocks in place. You can use this respite to figure out your next move or place multiple blocks before they take effect, which lets you blow up more than the maximum four lines of blocks if you play your Tetriminos correctly. The game itself has a ton of different modes and over 30 levels, so there&apos;s plenty of replay value. It&apos;s also fun to join in on the Weekend Rituals and try to unlock new perks with your fellow players.</p><p>What took this game from fun to near-perfect is the new Connected mode with cross-platform multiplayer. There&apos;s a Connected mode where three players work together to beat a boss, Score Attack to beat fellow players&apos; scores in real-time, or Zone Battles where you send garbage blocks to opponents&apos; boards.

Catan VR has been around the block for several years now, with ports for PC VR and PSVR platforms. But it&apos;s better than ever on the Quest, thanks to the fact that there&apos;s no wire pressing against your back while you ponder your next move.</p><p>If you&apos;ve never played Catan, here&apos;s the lowdown: Players each take the role of a settler that has landed on the island of Catan and is determined to make it their new home. The problem is, every other player also has the same goal, putting players in a pinch to develop a tight strategy early on and adapt when necessary. The end goal is to amass a set number of points to win, earned by building settlements, cities, and roads that connect.</p><p>Catan VR is an exceptional way to play the game because it feels like you&apos;re sitting at the same table with all three other players. At $15, it&apos;s not a terrible expense to pick up, and it makes for a super easy game night with friends and family that might not live close enough to play in-person with you. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p>Whether you&apos;re a Queen&apos;s Gambit junkie, a fan of that infamous scene at the end of Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone, a former chess club prodigy, or just a fan of the game, Chess Club is exactly what you were hoping for in a VR rendition. Thanks to some excellent hand tracking, players can use the Oculus Touch controllers or their hands to grab and move pieces across the board.</p><p>If classic chess is a little too vanilla for you, Chess Club features fantasy pieces that will attack each other in classic battle chess fashion. Personally, I remember playing battle chess on a friend&apos;s DOS computer as a kid and relish the ability to be able to finally grab these pieces and look closely at them as they wreak havoc on one another.</p><p>Play against friends or AI opponents, change up your avatar, swap out timed rule modes, or just study your historical move list to become the next chess champion of the world. No pressure. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>A free VR gem that evokes RTS classics like Starcraft</strong></p><p>Have you ever dreamed of commanding an armada of spacecraft, on your way to conquering an entire galaxy? What if you met alien resistance and had to form your own strategies for galactic dominance? Maybe you just read Ender’s Game as a kid and envisioned yourself at a Command School simulator.</p><p>Whatever the case, Gods of Gravity lets you do all these things in a way that feels so natural you’ll wonder if you have transformed into some kind of strategic god. Gods of Gravity is a real-time strategy game reminiscent of PC classics like Homeworld and Starcraft, all set in deep space with an intuitive VR-only interface. Plus, it’s totally free to play. You’ll only pay if you decide you want to unlock all the maps, gameplay options, or the in-game map creator.</p><p>As a strategic god, you’ll directly command your ships from world to world using a variety of tools. Each map begins at a homeworld where you’ll want to quickly capture moons to provide resources to build more ships. Physically grab and throw ships or just warp them through wormholes to the next world you want to conquer but beware the other players vying for the same space.</p><p>Gods of Gravity can be played single or multiplayer but the goal is always the same: conquer (or destroy) everyone’s homeworlds and rule the galaxy. The game has seen several updates since its official Meta Quest store release including new god powers — you’ll choose one of these before beginning each round — and a bevy of maps to play in addition to all the community maps available. It’s a strategy gamer’s dream come true and an absolute blast to play with friends! —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>An incredibly complex, detailed real-time strategy game about terraforming Mars</strong></p>
<p>When classic games get ported to VR, one of the most common complaints is that the developers “dumbed the game down” in order to fit in the technical confines of a mobile VR headset. Per Aspera VR isn’t one of those games, perfectly porting every aspect of the flat game into what feels like a perfectly made-for-VR game.</p><p>Per Aspera is a technically detailed strategy game that’ll have you managing precious resources and sustaining human life on Mars, all while terraforming the planet and watching it evolve over time. The goal here is to make Mars completely habitable for humans and the game takes plenty of actual science and mixes it with fiction in a way that doesn’t feel far-flung at all.</p><p>In the game, you’ll play as an AI named AMI who goes to Mars first and uses the planet’s resources to build a habitable base for human colonists. It takes a bit of time before your first colonist will actually land on the planet, letting you get acquainted with the controls and deep research trees before diving into the real meat of the game.</p><p>As you explore the planet, you’ll find everything from abandoned research bases left by China and other countries, crashed satellites, and plenty of natural resources to mine. The goal is to, essentially, melt the planet’s ice caps and turn it into Earth 2.0 which, as you guessed it, transforms the landscape into a lush planet with plenty of water. This one is best played seated but can be enjoyed while standing.</p>

<p><strong> If you build it, they will come </strong></p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to live on a space station at least once in my life. There’s no telling if this will happen before my time on this planet has passed, but Spacefolk City offers me a chance to at least build some strange child-like approximation of what a city in space might look like.</p><p>Spacefolk City takes after many great building simulation games like Two Point Hospital, Two Point Campus, and even classics like Dungeon Keeper and Evil Genius. “If you build it, they will come” is absolutely the mantra here. Just like those classics, you’ll begin putting together your space city building-by-building, pathway-by-pathway until you’ve got a sprawling civilization that attracts aliens from all corners of the galaxy.</p><p>And these are really funky little aliens too. Hotdog aliens, pizza aliens, rabbit aliens with magic hats. It’s all super family-friendly and incredibly easy to build and design by just placing buildings where you think they should go, decorating them to make all your citizenry as happy as possible. You’ll even collect resources from passing asteroids and defend your cities from UFOs trying to steal things.</p><p>Plus, the developers have done an absolutely marvelous job of keeping the game updated with seasonal content that’s accessible year-round, adding to the dozens and dozens of campaign scenarios to play through. <em>— Nick Sutrich</em> </p>

<p><strong>Take to the sky for dogfighting, challenges, and exploration</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ultrawings-vr-review-become-pilot-youve-always-wanted">Ultrawings VR</a> came out when VR games were much less polished, offering a charming, low-resolution flying simulator that plenty of people loved. Ultrawings 2 arrived in 2022 with a lot more visual polish, a long-anticipated multiplayer mode, an open world of islands, and dozens of hours of gameplay to enjoy.</p><p>The game isn&apos;t a serious simulator on par with Microsoft Flight Simulator, but it does have very realistic-seeming flight controls and a mixture of both "serious" dogfighting challenges and more cartoonish minigames to keep you entertained. This game has tons of depth and we highly recommend it, unless you&apos;re especially sensitive to motion sickness. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p>You&apos;re technically supposed to wait until your child is at least 14 years old to play games in VR, but it&apos;s safe enough in moderation. Some parents will want games specifically for their young &apos;uns, while others will want games that kids <em>and</em> adults can enjoy. Thankfully, most of the best family-friendly games are ones that people of all ages will get a kick out of, even if they don&apos;t have the violence or serious storytelling of some other favorites.</p><p><strong>Family-friendly games in best overall: </strong>A Fisherman&apos;s Tale, Vacation Simulator</p>
<h2 id="angry-birds-vr-isle-of-pigs-2">Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs</h2>

<p><strong>It's exactly what you think it is</strong></p>
<p>Does Angry Birds even need an introduction? The game that practically defined quality mobile gaming proved to be a perfect fit for VR puzzle heads. Grab your slingshot, load it with a bird, and fling them at defiant piggies that just won&apos;t stop stealing eggs, no matter how many times you defeat them. Clever physics-based puzzles have been the hallmark of the series since its inception, and the translation to 3D space only makes them more compelling.</p><p>Developer Resolution Games has been behind over half a dozen VR hits and used that experience to translate Angry Birds to VR. It updated the game several times since the original launch, and players can now sling through over 100 official levels of mayhem, with each level topping the last in terms of complexity. There&apos;s even a level creator and thousands of community-made levels to play, so you can sift through those in your free time and aim to top the developers in their level-building skills after.</p><p>Plus, Quest 3 players can enjoy a mixed reality mode and hand tracking capabilities that are new for Spring 2024, letting you play Angry Birds on your living room floor as if it were a set of real toys. —<em>Nick Sutrich</em></p>

<p><strong>Another home-run puzzler from Owlchemy Labs</strong></p>
<p>A healthy majority of VR fans have played Job Simulator or Vacation Simulator (two other picks below). Developer Owlchemy Labs didn&apos;t stray too far from its comfort zone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cosmonious-high-review">Cosmonious High</a>; it may have a much different look and theme, set in a high school for aliens, but it has the same humor, puzzles, and creative mechanics we&apos;ve come to expect.</p><p>As an alien called a Prismi, you can adapt your abilities and powers to your surroundings, enabling some context-sensitive tools to find your way out of one brain-teaser after another. As you master your abilities, you&apos;ll interact with the charming students and teachers, made memorable by great voice acting and writing. As with any great family-friendly game, it&apos;s one a child can freely enjoy but that offers plenty of entertainment and depth for adults. —<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<p><strong>LEGO is finally in VR, and it&apos;s just as great as we&apos;d hoped</strong></p>
<p>Get up close and personal with LEGO sets just as if they were right in front of you, all without having to spend hundreds of dollars on each and every set. LEGO Brick Tales is an action game with light platforming elements that sees you controlling characters that walk around diorama-sized levels, each packed to the gills with secrets to find and little details to take in.</p><p>As you venture through each of the game&apos;s worlds, you&apos;ll solve levels and problems by building your own LEGO solutions, each of which is entirely physics-based and realistic. The diorama-like levels might be prebuilt, but there&apos;s nothing prebuilt about the contraptions and solutions you can build yourself.</p><p>Each world sports different themes, different playable characters, and tons of puzzles to build and solve. You can completely walk around each level and inspect it, and Meta Quest Pro and Quest 3 players can view each level in mixed reality space, making it look as if these LEGO worlds were built with real bricks right in your own home. It&apos;s unbelievably fun and more rewarding the more creative you are!</p>

<p>There&apos;s something timeless and deeply charming about 90s platformers. Max Mustard is inspired by all the best 90s 3D platformers like Super Mario 64, Sonic Adventure, Banjo Kazooie, and Crash Bandicoot, but the genre takes on a life of its own from a VR perspective.</p><p>Just as platformers jump from 2D to 3D, the jump into VR opens up a new way to see the world around your character, better judge distance, and even interact with the world around your character. Levels are often packed with unique power-ups that help you through the unique challenges presented in each, and the variety of power-ups and environments is unmatched from platformers on the Meta Quest.</p><p>With gorgeous Saturday morning cartoon-like visuals, a great soundtrack, and a fun storyline, Max Mustard will appeal to your sense of nostalgia just as much as it will to the younger gamers in your household.</p>

<p><strong>A VR classic that redefines the traditional platforming experience</strong></p>
<p>The original Moss is still one of the best Oculus Quest games despite its age, and we still recommend playing it. If you&apos;d rather just pick up one game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moss-book-2-review-psvr">Moss: Book II</a> explains the plot of the first game so you can dive right into it. Fans of the original will also love this long-awaited sequel thanks to revamped gameplay, puzzles, and combat. It, quite literally, picks up the second after the first game ends.</p><p>As with the original, you play a spirit who assists Quill, a brave young mouse warrior, in her fight against evil forces. If you wave at her, she waves back, and if she runs into a puzzle, she signs in ASL to tell you how to get past it. She feels like a living partner, not an avatar. When Quill runs into obstacles she can&apos;t get past, you move your head to look around the map and find ways past the obstacles, then guide her to them. </p><p>The sequel adds more complexity, letting you choose different weapons and form your own unique playstyle as you support Quill. You can also interact more directly with the environment to help your mouse companion traverse impossible obstacles instead of just finding a hidden path. </p><p>Our Moss: Book II reviewer played the entire campaign with the game cast to the TV and his son&apos;s eyes glued to the screen. It&apos;s an experience that both adults and older kids who can figure out the tricky puzzles will enjoy.—<em>Michael Hicks</em></p>

<hr>
<p>Android gamers can already play console-quality games on their flagship smartphones with the advent of Xbox Cloud Gaming and the Xbox Game Pass app. However, thanks to a recent U.S. court decision that barred Google from forcing Google Play Billing on developers, Microsoft will introduce new ways to buy and play games on Android. Starting next month, you&apos;ll be able to buy an Xbox game and stream it from the cloud on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> — all from the Xbox app.</p><p>The move comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-legal-setback-could-open-the-door-for-more-app-stores-on-android">following a landmark decision</a> by Judge James Donato in federal court that ruled Google must open up the Android app ecosystem to competitors. The changes stipulate that Google has to make it easy for third-party app stores to exist, distribute apps, and use their own payment systems. Google Play Billing, which was required and forced a revenue-sharing model with Google upon developers, is now optional. </p><p>That&apos;ll prop up other app and game marketplaces, like the one that&apos;s coming to the Xbox app. Xbox president Sarah Bond briefly shared the brand&apos;s plans in a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255?" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a> on Thursday, Oct. 10. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The court's ruling to open up Google´s mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility.

<p>"The court&apos;s ruling to open up Google´s mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility," said Bond. "Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android."</p><p>Microsoft&apos;s rivals, like Steam and PlayStation, have long offered mobile purchases. However, it looks like the recent Google antitrust rulings opened the door for Microsoft to offer similar features in the Xbox app. It would seem like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a> was the issue, though, because Microsoft already allowed users to purchase games on the Xbox Game Pass app through the Samsung Galaxy Store.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear whether Microsoft plans to make sweeping changes to the Xbox mobile app or simply add mobile purchases to the currently available options. The company previously acknowledged the existence of an Xbox mobile store in August and also continues to develop a web-based store.</p><p>Following regulations and court decisions from both the U.S. and E.U., we&apos;re already seeing more options become available for Android gamers. The injunction from the U.S. takes effect Nov. 1, and Microsoft says purchases will be possible in the Xbox app sometime after. </p><p>Meanwhile, game developer Epic brought the Epic Games Store to iOS and iPadOS in the E.U. after regulators forced Apple to open up its mobile platforms. It&apos;s also available on Android via sideloading. </p>

<p>Theoretically, there is nothing stopping Epic from officially launching the Epic Games Store on the Google Play Store when these new rules take effect. That&apos;s why the recent court decisions hold so much weight.  </p>

<p>It&apos;s fitting that the Xbox and Android ecosystems are finally coming together because they&apos;ve been trending in that direction for a while. Google has been forced to open up Android due to regulations and court decisions, while Microsoft has generally expanded the Xbox ecosystems of its own volition. </p><p>Although the company has continued to acquire publishers, Microsoft seems disinterested in keeping titles exclusive to Xbox hardware. Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment were the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/heres-when-four-xbox-games-are-heading-to-other-consoles">first four Microsoft games to toss their Xbox exclusivity aside</a>. Since then, Microsoft executives have thrown their support behind other hardware, like when Phil Spencer talked about the emergence of PC gaming handhelds (and even teased the potential for an Xbox handheld).</p><p>It&apos;s hard not to view Microsoft&apos;s shift toward an open-ecosystem future as a company failure since Xbox lost this generation of the console wars to PlayStation by just about every metric. It&apos;s also hard to deny the fact that this shift benefits consumers. Now, you&apos;re able to play the top games coming out of Microsoft studios on more devices. With Xbox Cloud Gaming, the options are even further expanded.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google seemingly hasn&apos;t been as interested in the idea of opening up Android or the Google Play Store at this level. But it&apos;s happening, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-ruling-the-good-the-unfair-and-the-unlikely">whether we like it or not</a>. We might start to see regulatory bodies and courts push harder against big tech and its monopolistic practices following this early showing, because it only took a few days for consumers to benefit from the U.S.&apos;s injunction against Google.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I recently spent part of an afternoon talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">MicroLED displays</a> with my colleague Michael Hicks and how they may not be quite ready for wearables just yet. I enjoy this type of discussion as I am more interested in manufacturing and "how it&apos;s made" than the final product in most cases.</p><p>You can read how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-leak-suggests-fenix-8-microled-watch-coming-but-reasons-for-skepticism">Michael dissects the latest MicroLED rumor</a> and why we should be skeptical. The tech is currently available, but issues with cost and manufacturing make it very expensive to produce consumer electronics like a smartwatch that uses it.</p>
<p>This isn&apos;t something we talk about very often even though it helps drive every decision of manufacturer makes: cost to produce versus profit per sale. It&apos;s the reason why we waited so long to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-g-flex-2-review">"bendable" OLED displays</a> become popular, why we had to wait even longer to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">phones that actually folded in half</a>, and taken to its logical conclusion, why Apple isn&apos;t selling foldable phones.</p><p>Using MicroLED as an example helps us understand this much better. The technology is potentially brighter than OLED, has a longer life, doesn&apos;t experience burn-in, is more energy efficient, and eliminates distortion from extreme viewing angles. It sounds like the perfect display material, and seeing it come in things like phones and watches would be great.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="gJbU4JvcToqC3srqxydZAb" name="Google-ar-glasses-prototypes.jpg" alt="Google AR prototypes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJbU4JvcToqC3srqxydZAb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>MicroLED is also crazy expensive to use for the display on a "cheap" off-the-shelf consumer device. This stems from manufacturing issues, making the cost of the parts very high when compared to current display tech. Nobody wants to see the cost of a phone rise another $200 or a smartwatch cost an extra $1,000 because the smaller the screen, the more manufacturing issues there are.</p><p>The tech is ready and could be used right now. Apple was said to be exploring using MicroLED on this year's Apple Watch but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240301-12054.html">abandoned those plans</a> when faced with the costs. We've heard rumors that Samsung is also exploring the tech, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-reportedly-buying-microled-display-maker-raxium-for-its-ar-push">Google purchased a MicroLED startup</a>, and most recently, Garmin is looking into the use of MicroLED. Companies want to use it because they think we will like the products that use it.</p>
<p>The only thing stopping it from happening is cost. That issue will be solved and when it happens, we'll see adoption of MicroLED for use in displays. Until then, we won't.</p><p>How does this tie into Apple and foldables? OLED displays are capable and not extremely expensive, and issues with bending glass have also been sorted out. Apple could build a folding iPhone tomorrow if it wanted. It doesn't.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="LdPSeZF7UP3JmZ7nzrmovB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-6.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the OPPO Find N3 Flip" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdPSeZF7UP3JmZ7nzrmovB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4129" height="2323" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to product development, making enough money is as important as making any money. Apple does not build a phone for you; it builds a phone for itself. It then spends money to tell you why you might want the phone it wants to sell. All companies do this on some level.</p><p>Apple's iPhone is the company's bread and butter. The money made from selling iPhones allows the company to spend money on other products, software development, and things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-m1-chip-helping-apple-expand-its-brand-lock">R&D for future projects</a>. Without a high enough profit margin for the iPhone, Apple would need to adjust its business to compensate. A foldable iPhone would sell like hotcakes, and people would be willing to put up with issues arising from the "new" tech. But Apple can't get the profit margins from one right now.</p><p>Samsung or Garmin will sell a device with a MicroLED display when it thinks it can make enough money from doing it. And Apple will sell a foldable when there's enough money to be made on every unit sold.</p>

<p>On August 2, 2021, Google's efforts in the consumer market were changed forever. This is when the Pixel 6 was officially confirmed, as Google seemingly grew tired of seeing its own phone being leaked over and over again. After a little over two months passed, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro were announced, with a subsequent release a week and a half later.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and Google's most recent Pixel lineup consists of four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">slab phones</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">foldable phone</a>, a tablet, and a watch. All of which combine to provide the cohesive experience we used to long for. More recently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a> was thrown into the mix, coming as a replacement for the long-standing Chromecast series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="KMwCNAjhNv7KsvzT2ASJsR" name="pixel-9-pixel-watch-2-pixel-buds-pro-2-pixel-9-pro-fold-family-5.jpg" alt="Pixel 9, Pixel Watch 3, Pixel Buds 2 Pro portfolio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMwCNAjhNv7KsvzT2ASJsR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think Google's quite done yet either, as the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-should-build-new-nest-hub-with-gemini">Nest Hub</a> will be four years old in March 2025, while the Nest Hub Max will celebrate its sixth birthday in May 2025. I'm still of the mindset that the Pixel Tablet is quietly operating as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-not-nest-hub-replacement">Google's replacement</a> for the Nest Hub Max, but I'm still hopeful for a Gemini-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/we-need-new-nest-hardware-not-pixel-tablet-2">Nest revamp</a>.</p><p>So why is it that the Google TV Streamer is more important than just being a replacement for a Chromecast? Because it's proof, to me at least, that Google is committed to providing a premium experience across its entire product lineup. It's no different than what Apple has been doing for years, but just at a little bit of a slower pace.</p>

<p>Not only does the TV Streamer serve up a new way to watch your favorite movies and shows, but it also operates as the central hub for everything in your home. This is thanks to the built-in Thread border router, in addition to supporting the Matter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices">smart home</a> standard. Speaking of which, this also means that you can connect the Streamer to Apple HomeKit, but it's not something I recommend.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sTUoLSkpReBCqgpNU62euM" name="google-tv-streamer-smart-home-panel-hands-on.jpg" alt="Smart Home Panel on Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sTUoLSkpReBCqgpNU62euM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not all, though, as the TV Streamer also introduced a new Smart Home Panel. Essentially, it's the same interface that you get when opening the Home app on your phone, lending more credence to the whole cohesive ecosystem idea from before. Of course, it's not some revolutionary idea or anything of the sort, but it is a new (and welcome) addition to the Google playbook.</p><p>No, the TV Streamer isn't as powerful as the latest Apple TV, and yes, it's probably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/turns-out-the-new-google-tv-streamer-has-a-different-chip-under-the-hood">using a processor</a> that's about as old as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/possible-nest-hub-max-refresh-spotted">Nest Hub Max</a>. But as long as Google doesn't fully embrace the Amazon route, implementing ads at every turn, then we should be fine for the next few years. Playing into Google's favor is that the TV Streamer offers twice as much RAM and storage compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Qr9kLgwdoBEGXBnWWMkVcV" name="amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review-13.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2023) review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qr9kLgwdoBEGXBnWWMkVcV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Let's hope Google never does this </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've reached the point where I feel more comfortable than ever recommending Google's ecosystem to those who are trying to figure out where to start. Amazon would probably be a close second, not because of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-fire-tv-stick">Fire TV</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire Tablets</a>, but because of the number of smart home companies that operate under its umbrella.</p><p>But with the TV Streamer providing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> and Thread support, you should (eventually) be able to tie those products into Google Home anyway. Better yet, you don't have to wait for smart accessory makers to implement Matter or Thread support, as you can just use Home Assistant on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a>. That's a story for another day.</p><p>The whole idea of providing a premium experience extends beyond even the TV Streamer and Nest Thermostat. I surmise it's also part of the reason why the Chromebook Plus moniker was born. This alone provides separation between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/best-chromebook-under-300/1000">cheap Chromebooks</a> and those that are more performant thanks to Google's minimum spec requirements. </p><p>Leading the pack in this regard is a familiar face, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-2024samsung-lenovo-chromebooks-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> will soon provide a premium experience at the high end of the space. Google and Samsung worked closely together during the development process. While that's something we've heard before (HP), Samsung and Google's relationship is just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-wear-os-google-smartwatch">a bit different</a> from the rest. </p><p>What I'm really hoping for is the Galaxy Chromebook Plus to lead the way for a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Pixelbook</a>. Sorry, but that's a drum that I'll never stop beating until it finally happens. In the meantime, I'll just sit back and finish watching the rest of this football game on the TV Streamer. </p>

Pick up the new Samsung Galaxy S24 FE 128GB and pay for an eligible data plan, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe/"><strong>the wireless carrier will hook you up with $649.99</strong></a> in promo credits over 36 months — enough to make the Fan Edition smartphone 100% free.</p><p>Unlike many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon offers</a>, this deal doesn&apos;t require you to trade in an old device or sign up for the most expensive wireless plan, either. The Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, and Unlimited Ultimate plans will all get you the max savings, and both new and existing Verizon customers are eligible. That&apos;s pretty darn impressive for a Samsung phone that&apos;s only been out since October 3rd. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a Verizon customer; you love Samsung Galaxy devices; you want a phone with long software support.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer to buy your phones unlocked; you&apos;re looking for a good trade-in deal.</p><p>Sleek and versatile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> boasts a Dynamic AMOLED 120Hz display with the efficiency of Samsung&apos;s very own Exynos 2400e processor under the hood.

After all, at $649.99, the Galaxy S24 FE isn&apos;t exactly cheap. If you prefer to buy your phones unlocked and can hold off a little while, I&apos;d probably wait for the Black Friday sales to come along and slash prices on the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S24 Plus. Those are both better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> than the FE, and the upcoming sale events are sure to knock the prices down considerably. </p><p>But with all of that being said, <em>if </em>you&apos;re a Verizon customer (or you&apos;re willing to switch) and you&apos;re in the market for a new Samsung phone, this S24 FE deal really can&apos;t be beat. </p>

<ul><li>A report states Google plans to improve how easy it is to access shortcuts on tablets and redesign its menu.</li><li>Shortcuts might be placed in a new side navigation "rail" on the side of a tablet's display and its menu could use a dual-column approach with search functionality.</li><li>Google brought a shortcut toolbar to physical keyboards for tablets in 2024 and upgraded the shortcut experience of Gmail and Chat.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might arrive with a useful update to improve the keyboard experience on Android tablets.</p><p>When looking through the recent QPR1 beta, Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-qpr1-keyboard-shortcut-menu-3488778/">Android Authority</a>) discovered Google&apos;s (potential) keyboard shortcut menu redesign. The change seems to address one particular problem: lack of ease. Rahman states that the recent QPR1 beta shows Google wants to add a "side navigation rail" for a tablet&apos;s assortment of keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>In testing, the rail appears as a vertical pill-shaped bar on the left side of a tablet&apos;s display. Tapping the hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) opens a sub-menu with settings, additional options, and "Show keyboard shortcuts."</p><p>Producing the menu in the beta shows that Google also redesigned that shortcut menu itself. Once it appeared, Rahman found certain aspects were moved into separate categories and contained spaces. For example, the list of shortcuts occupies the right side of the shortcut menu. The left side displays easy-to-tap categories for shortcuts. It seems Google plans to break things up into the following categories: system, multitasking, app shortcuts, and input.</p><p>Additionally, users can search for shortcuts to save time. The function works similarly to any "search" bar across Android&apos;s OS, like the app drawer.</p><p>It&apos;s also not clear when Google plans to roll this out. Rahman suspects it <em>could </em>arrive during the first QPR&apos;s release, which is slated for December 2024.</p>

<p>The publication&apos;s post notes how different the current menu looks. Most of the aspects are stacked, with the search bar on top followed by horizontal categories and the list of shortcuts beneath that. Moreover, Rahman adds that users normally reach for the top of their tablet to produce the shortcuts menu. This subtle placement change should make things easier.</p><p>The keyboard experience of tablets has been a consistent subject for Google as it rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/gboard-physical-keyboard-toolbar-tablets-rollout">a shortcut toolbar</a> for physical variants in January. The bar was a part of a Gboard update for USB-C or Bluetooth-connected keyboards. Users can find a toolbar at the bottom of their displays with "scrollable" pop-up windows and a list of shortcuts separated into categories across the screen.</p><p>Tablets even picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gmail-chat-foldable-tablet-updates-2024">a shortcut update</a> over the summer for a few of Google&apos;s Workspace apps.</p><p>The company rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a> in September — and it was a pretty chunky update. Some update highlights include a fix for Pixel Bluetooth, app crashes, stability issues, and a preview of a few new features. More importantly, Android 15 has been rumored to drop sometime in October.</p>

<ul><li>Whoop detailed in a blog post that it is rolling out a step-tracking update for its fitness band and app.</li><li>Users can find their tracked steps on "My Dashboard" and create a personalized "Weekly Plan" from the Plan tab.</li><li>The Whoop 4.0 band was announced in 2021 and offers improved blood oxygen and skin temperature tracking alongside integration with Whoop Body.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Whoop, a fitness band maker, details an upcoming tracking feature that might bring users joy.</p><p>The company stated in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/start-tracking-steps-with-whoop/">a blog post</a> that it plans to bring an update to its users that adds step tracking (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/09/whoop-adds-step-counting/">9to5Google</a>). Whoops cites scientific research behind why it&apos;s bringing step tracking to its band and app. It&apos;s suggested that people take anywhere from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext?ref=sampinder.co.uk">seven thousand to 10,000 steps</a> per day to reduce the risk of heart disease and obesity.</p><p>Whoop says its step tracking leverages the accelerometer within your fitness band. This will play off your "natural movement" alongside the incoming "step detection algorithm." The data Whoop takes in will be placed in daily, weekly, monthly, and six-month step "trends" for rediscovery.</p><p>With that, the post states users can create a "Weekly Plan" for their steps and milestone notifications. Moreover, the "Strain" aspect of the app was discussed. Whoop makes the clear distinction that Strain matters when you&apos;re exerting yourself rigorously with your muscles or working your cardiovascular system heavily.</p><p>It states walking shouldn&apos;t increase your Strain; however, if your heart rate elevates, the data will be considered as such.</p><p>In the Whoop app, users can find their tracked steps on "My Dashboard." User can customize their dashboard to move the step-tracking data higher or out of sight. The post states that "Weekly Plan" is done via the "Plan" tab. Through a separate press release, 9to5 confirmed that the update for Whoop will arrive today (Oct 10) and will likely continue to roll out over the next few days.</p>

<p>Whoop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-new-fitness-tracker-doesnt-have-just-live-your-wrist">announced</a> its latest fitness band, the 4.0, in 2021. The health tracker arrived as a modern approach to health analytics and is meant to be worn 24/7. With a comfortable, woven band, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop 4.0</a> can fit seamlessly into your lifestyle as it also lacks a bright, distracting screen.</p><p>An interesting aspect of the Whoop 4.0 is that users don&apos;t have to wear it on their wrists all day. The company states users can pick up some Whoop Body, which lets them slot the tracker into a shirt, sports bra, sleeve, or leggings and it will continue its job.</p><p>The device was already upgraded with improved blood oxygen and skin temperature detection. Now, with the arrival of step tracking, the Whoop might be a series of devices on your radar.</p>

<ul><li>According to reports, Qualcomm confirmed that several of its chips, such as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, experienced a zero-day exploit.</li><li>The attack seemed "limited" and "targeted," though Qualcomm does not know who it affected, only that devices from Samsung, Motorola, OnePlus, and more are involved.</li><li>Qualcomm confirmed that it fixed the zero-day bug in September 2024, but more information will surface from Amnesty International's research.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm and two more important parties step forward with information about a "zero-day" attack on Android.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/october-2024-bulletin.html">chipmaker detailed</a> on its Security Bulletin that it provided a fix for a "CVE-2024-43047" issue (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/09/hackers-were-targeting-android-users-with-qualcomm-zero-day/">TechCrunch</a>). The zero-day vulnerability wasn&apos;t stated as a widespread issue, instead, Qualcomm states it was a "limited, targeted exploitation." Of course, this issue caught the attention of Google and Amnesty International&apos;s Security Lab. Both companies have reportedly started investigating "the use" of the attack.</p><p>Google Threat Analysis Group delivered "indications" to Qualcomm about this issue before it took action. The report states Amnesty "confirmed" the Analysis Group&apos;s initial suspicions about the zero-day bug.</p><p>TechCrunch heard from Amnesty&apos;s spokesperson Hajira Maryam, who said the company is working on a research paper about the issue, "due to be out soon." Right now, nothing is certain about the purpose behind this exploit — and who it may have targeted. Qualcomm <em>did </em>confirm that the attack affected 64 of its SoCs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/snapdragon-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</a>.</p><p>Moreover, the company states the problem concerns Samsung, Motorola, Xiaomi, OnePlus, OPPO, and ZTE devices. While we&apos;re getting confirmation <em>now</em>, the issue has reportedly been rectified. A Qualcomm spokesperson informed the publication that "fixes have been made available to our customers as of September 2024."</p><p>Severe vulnerabilities are (unfortunately) a possibility with tech and Qualcomm suffered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualpwn-exploit-qualcomm-chips">a WLAN exploit in 2019</a>. "QualPwn" was its name and allowed would-be attackers unsanctioned access to a device via WLAN and its cell Modem remotely. The exploit was able to bypass Qualcomm&apos;s use of Secure Boot. Once inside, it was reported that attackers could&apos;ve gone deeper into Android&apos;s kernel and accessed user&apos;s data.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/project-zero-exynos-modem-vulnerability">similar incident occurred</a> with Pixel and Galaxy phones with Samsung&apos;s Exynos modem last year. Attackers could&apos;ve gained remote access via the modem to compromise a device and deal damage.</p><p>The good news with this current 2024 incident is Qualcomm has already fixed it (as of September) thanks to Google and Amnesty&apos;s help. What&apos;s to come to concrete information about who the attack may have targeted and the extent of its damage.</p>

However, it was quickly paused the next day because some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a> owners experienced issues like the device getting stuck with a blank screen right after the firmware update.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6" name="pixel-watch-2-final-review-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 while charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/301420568">Pixel Watch community post</a>, the company announced that it is still "actively working on a resolution." This means there is no specific release date for the new update just yet. Google notes that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> rollout will only begin later this year after the team mitigates "the observed issues." More updates regarding the rollout will likely be shared in the coming weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pixel Watch 1 and Watch 2 users experiencing the issues are guided to reset their smartwatches. The company is also providing relevant guides and steps on how to fix smartwatches with blank or frozen screens.</p>
<p>So, users who have installed the September update bearing <strong>AW2A.240903.005.A2</strong> version for the Pixel Watch 1 and Pixel Watch 2 with <strong>AW2A.240903.005.A1</strong> are likely the ones experiencing the aforementioned issues and are advised to reset their devices. </p><p>Although Google&apos;s prompt resolution of the Pixel Watch issue is welcome, it would have been more interesting if the search giant had developed a workable solution instead of giving the owners an ambiguous time frame.</p><p>For those wondering, Wear OS 5 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">first previewed</a> at Google I/O this year. It ought to bring major upgrades to battery life, fitness, and watch faces. For example, with Wear OS 5-powered Pixel Watch, users can experience 20% less power consumption than with the smartwatch bearing Wear OS 4.</p>

<hr>
<p>It&apos;s rare to see one of the biggest tech companies in the world admit that it&apos;s facing a significant problem. Well, that&apos;s exactly what Samsung&apos;s vice chairman of Samsung Electronics&apos; DS Division, Jeon Young-hyun, did in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/고객과-투자자-그리고-임직원-여러분께-말씀드립니" target="_blank">press release</a> this week. Young-hyun acknowledged that outsiders are viewing the company&apos;s current situation as a "crisis" and vowed to make changes and improvements that will benefit investors, customers, and employees alike. </p><p>"To our customers, investors, and employees who have always loved Samsung Electronics, Today, we, the management of Samsung Electronics, would like to first apologize to you," the press release, translated to English, read.</p><p>"The performance that fell short of market expectations has raised concerns about the fundamental technological competitiveness and the future of the company. Many people are talking about Samsung’s crisis," the statement continued. "All of this responsibility lies with us who are leading the business."</p><p>The past two years haven&apos;t gone smoothly for the South Korean tech giant. First, financial results and earnings started to slip in 2023 after encouraging post-pandemic figures. The release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> didn&apos;t seem to markedly improve things, with Samsung losing market share to its competitors throughout 2024. </p><p>The turmoil also drew attention to Samsung in less-than-favorable ways. In April 2024, Samsung initiated a six-day workweek for executives to create "a sense of crisis" among the company&apos;s leadership team. </p><p>Following the criticism of new Galaxy wearables, which many viewed as Apple design knockoffs, it was reported that the Samung MX Division&apos;s chairman, Lee Jae-yong, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">was "angry" at the team&apos;s design</a>. Of course, this left us wondering why a Samsung chairman was only finding about the products&apos; designs <em>after</em> they released.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That leads us to now, when Young-hyun is publicly apologizing for the company&apos;s lack of innovation. </p><p>"Samsung has a history of challenge, innovation, and overcoming that has always turned crises into opportunities. We will definitely make the serious situation we are currently facing into an opportunity for a leap forward," the statement read. </p><p>"Above all, we will restore the fundamental competitiveness of technology. Technology and quality are our lifeblood," Young-hyun wrote. "It is Samsung Electronics’ pride that we can never compromise on. Rather than short-term solutions, we will secure fundamental competitiveness."</p><p>Despite Samsung&apos;s efforts in April 2024 to rectify things, the so-called "crisis" seems to be getting worse before it gets better. The newly-launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> sold less than 300,000 units in its first two weeks of availability, according to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1828779774673928473?" target="_blank">Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, who has a solid track record. That&apos;s fewer units than the Galaxy Z Fold 5 sold last year, per the report, and seemingly continues Samsung&apos;s regression. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 is worse than Fold5... It seems that AI alone cannot save Samsung.Globally, only 270,000 units were sold in the first two weeks.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1828779774673928473">August 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Official estimations from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share" target="_blank">International Data Corporation (IDC)</a> confirm that Samsung has lost smartphone market share as of Q2 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. IDC reports that although Samsung moved over 53 million smartphone units in the second quarter, its market share dipped to 18.4 percent — down from 20 percent at the same point last year. Meanwhile, competitors Xiaomi and Vivo expanded their market share year-over-year. </p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, Samsung did ship more phones in Q2 2024 than anyone else. However, it might not be a coincidence that Xiaomi and Vivo — which are both pushing the boundaries of smartphone technology outside North America — are gaining on Samsung as it, by its own admissions, isn&apos;t innovating like it should be.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-19.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 screen on in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who has closely followed Samsung product launches and financial results for the past few years, it&apos;s not particularly surprising to me that sales are suffering. The company is releasing new devices, but they&apos;re not pushing the boundaries in a competitive smartphone market. </p><p>Take the standard Galaxy S24, which still packs the same camera system as the Galaxy S22. There&apos;s no reason we should be going three generations between camera upgrades. That&apos;s especially true while Apple and Google continue improving the camera systems on their base-model flagships. In all, the Galaxy S24&apos;s best feature was arguably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which made its way to the Galaxy S23 series eventually. </p><p>The worst offender is the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which shares the same rear main camera as the base Galaxy S24. That&apos;s despite the fact that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs over $1,000 more than the Galaxy S24 — and that it&apos;s really the same camera sensor as the nearly three-year-old Galaxy S22. I&apos;ve spent weeks with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a>, and it&apos;s Google&apos;s foldable that feels more innovative and exciting. There&apos;s no doubt about it. </p><p>It&apos;s hard to accept Samsung&apos;s apology as a reporter and reviewer that&apos;s closely followed the company&apos;s incremental updates for years, and watched brands like Pixel, OnePlus, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Honor trounce Samsung in terms of innovation. With that being said, it takes courage to acknowledge the elephant in the room, especially if you&apos;re a company as large as Samsung. Here&apos;s to hoping things improve starting with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> next year.</p>
