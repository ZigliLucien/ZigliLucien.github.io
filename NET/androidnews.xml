There are also new releases that fit the larger 45mm version of the Pixel Watch 3 to choose from.</p><p>You may not have as wide of a variety when choosing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> bands for the 45mm size option, but more third-party straps will definitely launch with time.

<p>The lovely Google Pixel Watch Active Band now comes in two sizes to accommodate the Pixel Watch 3, 41mm and 45mm. You can get this comfy fluoroelastomer band for any occasion.

<p>How I wish Google had figured out a way to use the same bands on both the 41mm and the 45mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-google-pixel-watch-3-should-you-buy">variants of the Pixel Watch 3</a>. They couldn&apos;t make this happen so now, anyone with the larger 45mm smartwatch is stuck with far fewer options when it comes to the best Google Pixel Watch 3 bands.</p><p>I highly recommend the Google Pixel Watch Active Band as the best overall band. And although you get this band in the box, I still suggest getting one more color to round things off. The Active Band comes in a couple of colors, but not all of them are available on the 45mm wristbands. Still, this is the most comfortable Pixel Watch 3 band hands down. You feel no fatigue or irritation even after wearing the band all day long and fleuroelastomer plays nice with sensitive skin. Also, the band&apos;s waterproof and it doesn&apos;t get dirty easily.</p><p>Style and pizzazz can be found in the Caseology Pixel Watch 3 lineup of wristbands. Both the Caseology Athlex Band and Caseology Nano Pop look sporty, are waterproof, and have an ergonomic wear experience. Swapping your existing strap with Caseology&apos;s bands is easy thanks to the spring action pin connector. And the best part is, if you&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> owner, you can grab a matching phone case to compliment your Pixel Watch 3 band.</p><p>Want even more choices?

<hr>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly "considering" if it should break up Google following the illegal search monopoly ruling. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/doj-considers-seeking-google-goog-breakup-after-major-antitrust-win?leadSource=uverify%20wall&embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> report, the DOJ reportedly looks at two potential divestments.</p><p>According to those close to the subject, if the DOJ continues this idea, it will push Google to divest its Android operating system. Such a move was formed due to Judge Amit P. Mehta&apos;s findings during the initial ruling. It was discovered that Google requires smartphone and other device makers to "sign an agreement" before receiving access to Gmail and the Play Store.</p><p>The other side of the divestment includes Google Chrome, which sources claim is included in the agreement OEMs must sign.</p><p>Instead of divesting, the DOJ may offer a more lenient option, such as pushing Google to share its search data with the competition. Such competitors include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-bing-edge-openai-chatgpt">Microsoft (Bing)</a>, DuckDuckGo, and more. The publication states that Google&apos;s stronghold over search provides it with "16 times" more data than the competition — while also gatekeeping that data to pad its lead over them.</p><p>Nothing is set in stone regarding the DOJ&apos;s potential shift to break up Google&apos;s hold in several areas.</p><p>However, it seems that Judge Mehta will have to accept any desired plans from the U.S. government before forcing Google to comply. As Bloomberg notes, the decision to break apart Google would cement itself as the largest move involving antitrust since AT&T and the infamous "Baby Bells" in 1984.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for any information about the current DOJ report. The company declined to comment on the ongoing process following the ruling.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">a landmark ruling</a> was brought down upon Google by Judge Amit P. Mehta who found that the company acted "illegally" to maintain a monopoly in search. Mehta stated Google enacted "shrewd business decisions" to obtain and retain the top spot on search over the competition. The 298-page ruling detailed Google&apos;s exchange with companies such as Apple to ensure it debuts as the default search engine on their devices.</p><p>It was found that Google made up 95% of the search market share in 2020, leaving Microsoft&apos;s Bing to make up the remaining 5%.</p><p>Google has had a long history with the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2020, the DOJ launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-government-set-file-antitrust-suit-against-google-today">an antitrust investigation</a> into the company due to its go-to status for search.

<ul><li>Google started rolling out its final patch for the Android 15 beta to enrolled Pixel testers.</li><li>The update is minor, only packing smaller fixes for issues that have appeared throughout this final stretch.</li><li>Google then announced that Android 15 QPR1 testing will begin "soon," potentially signaling a September launch of the next OS.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Development of Google&apos;s next major software version progresses as the company pushes another minor update for enrolled testers.</p><p>Google posted about its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1eri0u4/android_15_beta_42_now_available/">final Android 15 Beta 4.2 patch</a> on Reddit, which seems to hone in on several issues plaguing the software (and Pixels). The update should become available for enrolled testers soon. Devices ranging from the Pixel 6 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8</a> series, including the Pixel Fold and Tablet, are eligible for this patch.</p><p>Beta 4.2 isn&apos;t a substantial patch; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes#beta-4.2">its changelog states</a> that Google added a fix for a low frame rate issue caused by the camera. There was also a reported color saturation problem with the Pixel camera, which is also being rectified in the latest beta.</p><p>The remainder of the 4.2 patch is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where some devices were delayed in waking up.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a gray transparent bar was appearing when using the camera.</li><li>Fixed a camera issue that was causing a crash when changing zoom values.</li><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the UI to flicker.</li><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the YouTube app to crash.</li></ul>

<p>Enrolled users should continue to check to see if their device has picked up the update throughout the day. This can be done by hopping into <strong>Settings > System > System Updates</strong>.</p><p>Google also announced it will soon begin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1erml83/android_15_qpr1_beta_around_the_corner/">testing Android 15 QPR1</a> for interested Pixel owners. The company stated that this cycle will cover the December feature drop for Android 15 and that QPR1 builds upon the "bug fixes and improvements" from the beta. Pixel owners who are involved in Android 15&apos;s original beta testing <em>do not </em>need to leave the program to receive QPR1 testing access.</p><p>Those wishing to receive the stable version of Android 15 will need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices">opt out of the program</a>. The company offered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1erml83/android_15_qpr1_beta_around_the_corner/">additional instructions</a> on how to leave the program <em>without </em>wiping all of your data.</p><p>With the final Android 15 beta update here and the impending QPR1 testing afoot, users speculate September will hold the final product.</p><p>Throughout its testing, it&apos;s become evident that Google is plugging several features alongside better optimization into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. We&apos;re not staring at any major UI/design changes, but the smaller refinements should make for an overall better OS. Hopefully, with the update seemingly poised for September, perhaps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">the delays will be worth the wait</a>.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 comes in two sizes, and the smaller 41mm option is pretty darn similar to the Pixel Watch 2. You get a much better display and a few minor hardware upgrades for connectivity, but most of its coolest new tricks will also come to the Pixel Watch 2 with Wear OS 5. We're most excited to have a 1.4-inch display option, finally.</p></p>

<p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> vs. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> solely by their specs, you&apos;d assume that Google didn&apos;t make that many changes to its latest Android watch. It&apos;s fair to say that many of its coolest new features will also hit the Watch 2 soon, once it receives the latest Wear OS 5 update.</p><p>Even though Google gave the Pixel Watch 3 and 2 the same processor, sensors, battery, and other key hardware, it did make a few key changes to modernize the watch compared to the competition, primarily the revamped display with its second size option.</p><p>Below, we&apos;ll break down how the Pixel Watch 3 vs. 2 specs compare and whether Google did enough for you to upgrade.</p>

<p>When you look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 2 vs. 1, Google made plenty of changes</a>, but if you compare the Watch 3 vs. 2, you&apos;ll find more similarities than differences. Keep reading for a long laundry list of everything Google left unchanged between the Google Pixel Watch 3 and Watch 2.</p><p><strong>Processor: </strong>The Pixel Watch 3 retains the same Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chip as the Pixel Watch 2, along with other Android watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, and Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro. Even though the chip is two years old, it&apos;s still on the cutting edge for performance.</p><p>Specifically, both watches use four Arm Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz, plus a Cortex M33 MCU for background processes and 2GB of RAM. For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> has a new Exynos chip with one Arm Cortex-A78 core (1.6GHz), four Cortex-A55 cores (1.5GHz), and the same memory. </p><p>In other words, it&apos;s fair to say that the Pixel Watch 3 still matches the competition for performance, even if its chip is a repeat.</p><p><strong>Storage:</strong> Both watches give you 32GB of storage, offering plenty of space to download playlists and podcasts for phone-less streaming.

<p><strong>Sensors:</strong> The Pixel Watch 3 and 2 both borrowed their sensors from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a>, tracking your heart rate, resting HR, HR variability, blood oxygen, skin conductance for body response (cEDA), AFib detection (ECG), skin temperature, sleep duration and zones, and daily readiness.</p><p>Despite Google&apos;s new focus on running, the Pixel Watch 3 only offers standard GPS tracking (like the Watch 2), unlike the dual-band GPS you get on the Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p><strong>Protection:</strong> Either watch gives you an IP68 rating with 5ATM water protection. This means they&apos;re fully dust and water-resistant but shouldn&apos;t be submerged in shallow water for longer than 30 minutes or at a 50-meter depth for longer than 10 minutes.</p><p>Google gave the Pixel Watch 3 the same Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protective layer as its predecessor. Most smartwatches in this price range now use Sapphire Crystal, which is more scratch resistant, so you might reasonably find this disappointing.</p>

<p><strong>41mm design:</strong> Ignoring the new 45mm Pixel Watch 3 for a moment, the standard 41mm Watch 3 has the same diameter, thickness, and weight as the Pixel Watch 2. It has the same recycled aluminum materials and the same battery capacity. If it weren&apos;t for the display changes, you&apos;d have trouble telling them apart. </p><p>They use the same band connector, too, so your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-bands">Pixel Watch 2 bands</a> carry over to the Watch 3 — though <em>not</em> the Watch 3 45mm. They even share the same case colors (Matte Black, Polished Silver, or Champagne Gold) and the same band colors, except that the Watch 3 has a Rose Quartz band instead of Bay Active.</p><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>Once again, Google rates the Pixel Watch 3 as having a 24-hour battery life with AOD active, regardless of which size you choose. Even though the Watch 3 45mm has an extra 114mAh capacity, much of it goes directly into powering the extra display. </p><p>I&apos;ve heard some conflicting reports from Google staffers saying the 45mm Watch 3 might last longer than the 41mm Watch 3 and Watch 2, but I can&apos;t confirm that, so you shouldn&apos;t assume anything until we can test this for ourselves.</p><p><strong>Software: </strong>Although the Pixel Watch 2 uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> at the moment, it should update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> soon after the Pixel Watch 3 launches on September 10. So even though the Watch 3 is introducing some really cool features like live Nest Doorbell view and Fitbit Cardio Load, Watch 2 owners will receive them as well. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-metal-link-band-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Metal Link Band Close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why upgrade to the Pixel Watch 3 if so many things remain unchanged from the last generation? It&apos;s a fair question, but the Pixel Watch 3 vs. Watch 2 differences below could tempt you to switch.</p><p><strong>A new 1.4-inch option:</strong> Google finally took after Samsung, Apple, Garmin, and several other watchmakers by offering two size options for its mainline watch. </p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3 hands-on</a> tester Andrew Myrick, who also reviewed the Pixel Watch 2, praised the new variant, saying "any size concerns" he had with the "dainty" 41mm watch were "put to rest" by the 45mm option.</p><p>Wear OS 5 uses a flexible UI that adds more details and menu options for larger watch displays. In Andrew&apos;s test, he noted that the Watch 3 45mm had room for an extra four complications on the default watch face; similarly, when looking at the Fitbit app&apos;s Quick Start menu, he could see six sport icons on the 45mm Watch 3 compared to three on the 41mm Watch 3.</p><p>Best of all, this 45mm Watch 3 only weighs six grams more than the Watch 2 and measures the same 12.3mm in thickness, making it comfortably light combined with the default Active band. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AM58k4uyAjAsNjDAzKe5tG" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-with-pixel-buds-pro-2-4.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AM58k4uyAjAsNjDAzKe5tG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Revamped display: </strong>Google shrunk the Pixel Watch 2 display border by 16% for the Pixel Watch 3. Even though the screen space is the same as before, the glass rounds off the edge more quickly, so it doesn&apos;t feel as wasteful as before.</p><p>You also boost the display brightness from 1,000 to 2,000 nits, matching the Galaxy Watch 7 and Apple Watch Series 9. That earns it the name "Actua display," Google&apos;s term for displays bright enough to handle direct sunlight; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> also has an Actua display, though it hits an impressive 2,700 nits.</p><p>Another key Watch 3 display boost is to its refresh rate. The Pixel Watch 2 maxed out at 30Hz, making screen transitions more noticeable, while the Pixel Watch 3 has an LTPO display that hits a smoother 60Hz but can dip as low as 1Hz when you&apos;re using the always-on display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i" name="google-pixel-watch-3-google-tv-controls.jpg" alt="Google TV controls on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Both watches have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC contactless payments, GPS satellite tracking, and an optional LTE upgrade. Yet Google upgraded the Bluetooth standard from 5.0 to 5.3 this generation; while the data speeds and connection range don&apos;t change between these two, 5.3 consumes less power, both when sending data and when idling, and the connection itself is less susceptible to signal interference.</p><p>Google also gave the Pixel Watch 3 support for 5GHz Wi-Fi, which can typically deliver twice-as-fast download speeds as 2.4GHz. You&apos;ll be able to add new apps or sync your data much quicker than before.</p><p>One brand-new connectivity tool is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">Ultra Wideband (UWB)</a>. Phones and watches typically use UWB for finding lost devices nearby, or as a unique signature for unlocking things, such as car doors. In this case, Google promises that the Pixel Watch 3 will use UWB to auto-unlock your Pixel phone if it&apos;s nearby; we could also see further uses for it down the line.</p><p>Lastly, we&apos;ll point out that Google is charging $100 to add 4G LTE instead of $50 for the Pixel Watch 2. That might sound like a rip-off, but it appears Google is bundling two free years of LTE data with the watch; adding a watch to your carrier plan can often cost more than that in a year, let alone two, so it could make the Pixel Watch 3 LTE one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte">best LTE watches</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tM6xHPacLDCn8XUGC8wfz4" name="pixel-watch-2-final-review-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 charging animation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tM6xHPacLDCn8XUGC8wfz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Faster charging speeds:</strong> Here are the charging speeds for the Pixel Watch 2, Pixel Watch 3 41mm, and Pixel Watch 3 45mm:</p>

<p>As you can see, charging is relatively fast for all three watches up to 50% before slowing down to preserve battery life. The smaller Pixel Watch 3 is relatively speedy compared to the Pixel Watch 2, while the Pixel Watch 3 45mm takes a little longer than before because of its larger capacity. That, combined with the 24-hour battery life, means finding a convenient time to charge it could be tricky.</p><p><strong>Better HR accuracy for workouts:</strong> Google claims that the Pixel Watch 3 has the "most accurate heart rate for running" compared to the Pixel Watch 2 and 1. Why? Apparently these watches had issues with "light artifacts" that made it hard to catch rapid changes in heart rate during hard workouts, but Google "made significant improvements with generation tuning exactly for these challenging conditions."</p><p>Essentially, it&apos;s the same claim Samsung made with the Galaxy Watch 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, promising better heart rate data for hard runs. Samsung did <em>pretty</em> well in our fitness tests, but we&apos;re excited to test if Google does any better in our upcoming review.</p><p><strong>An extra year (?) of support:</strong> Google promised the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 would receive three years of security updates. We don&apos;t know yet whether that applies to the Pixel Watch 3, but it&apos;s not likely to get <em>fewer</em> updates than the Watch 2, so it should receive support through 2027 at least, while the Watch 2 will lose its support in 2026. We&apos;ll update this post when we have confirmation of this.</p>

<p>If you love the Pixel Watch 2 but wish it had a larger display, the Pixel Watch 3 will be a perfect option for you. It provides that extra space, naturally adjusting the interface so you see more information at once, and makes it much easier to read outdoors thanks to the extra nits.</p><p>Otherwise, the upgrades to the Bluetooth, wi-fi, and heart rate accuracy are fairly niche; the faster charging speed and enhanced display specs are great, but you might not be willing to pay another $349, unless you get some good trade-in credit for your Pixel Watch 2. </p><p>If you order from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_watch_3">Google Store</a>, they&apos;re offering a $220 mail-in rebate for your Pixel Watch 2, so it&apos;d cost you $180 to jump to the Pixel Watch 3 45mm. That&apos;s not a bad price, in theory!</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> today, and while the Pixel Watch 3 should take its place on our list after we review it, the Watch 2 will receive many of its best perks like the revamped Fitbit training tools and better Pixel phone integration. You may decide to be patient and wait for the Pixel Watch 4, in the hopes it has more significant upgrades to performance and battery life.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>Google just unveiled its new Pixel phones, including its latest foldable model, but carrier compatibility is already causing ripples.</p><p>According to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/at-t-says-it-wont-carry-googles-pixel-9-pro-fold/" target="_blank">CNET report</a>, AT&T has decided not to carry the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. This move means Google misses out on AT&T&apos;s massive subscriber base, unless customers go for the unlocked version.</p><p>It’s a shame AT&T won’t carry the latest foldable from the tech giant. With a bigger screen, a sleeker design, and better proportions, it’s a serious contender for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top foldable smartphone</a>.</p><p>Simply put, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is impressive, but it’s a letdown for potential buyers that AT&T won’t be offering it.</p><p>It’s also puzzling that AT&T would skip the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, especially since the carrier still offers the first-gen Pixel Fold and plans to carry the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Google’s latest foldable fits right in with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>, packing the same top-tier features, including the Tensor G4 chip and advanced Gemini AI. Plus, its ultra-thin design makes it all the more premium-looking.</p><p>On the flip side, AT&T is still offering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s main competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>While AT&T’s decision to skip the Pixel 9 Pro Fold remains a mystery, it could be due to underwhelming sales of the first-generation Pixel Fold. But for now, it&apos;s anybody&apos;s guess.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if AT&T will officially support unlocked Pixel 9 Pro Fold devices on its network. We’ve contacted AT&T for more details and will update this article when we receive a response.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold will launch on September 4 for $1,799. While Verizon and T-Mobile are on board, AT&T&apos;s choice to skip Google&apos;s new foldable is a notable outlier among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">major carriers</a>.</p>

The decision comes down to two things: clean software and consistent cameras. While most Android skins have decent interfaces these days, there&apos;s still a lot of overt styling, and I prefer what Google does in this area with Material You.</p><p>And while Google doesn&apos;t have the outright lead in cameras these days — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> take better photos and videos — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> takes the most consistent photos, and it does a great job with portrait shots and moving objects.</p>

<p>That said, Google&apos;s phones aren&apos;t without issues. I&apos;ve had a litany of problems with Pixels over the years; the panel on the Pixel 2 XL had washed-out colors, it didn&apos;t take much to break the Pixel 3 XL (I did it twice in two months), the oleophobic coat on my Pixel 4 XL wore out in under three months of use, and the volume rocker on the Pixel 7 Pro detached randomly one day. Last year, the Pixel 8 Pro decided to charge sporadically, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-already-doubting-the-long-term-durability-of-my-pixel-8-pro">USB-C port was to blame</a> — this was an issue on the Pixel 6 Pro as well.</p><p>Look, most phones have some issue or another, but the percentage of hardware-related problems I&apos;ve had with Pixels is significantly higher than any other brand. With Google now guaranteeing seven years of updates, it needs to do better in this area, and if the messaging around better durability is any indication, it looks like the brand is taking this seriously.</p><p>While that&apos;s undoubtedly good, Google for some reason just can&apos;t seem to nail the basics. Some of this is down to the choice of hardware; Google used Samsung&apos;s Exynos 2400 as the foundation for the Tensor G4, and other than newer cores, it is nearly indistinguishable to the Tensor G3.</p><p>Google made it clear that it doesn&apos;t want to chase performance numbers, and the brand instead chooses to focus on the TPU that powers all the AI features on its devices. That&apos;s fine by me; I don&apos;t use the Pixel 8 Pro because it is the fastest, but because it has a good overall experience. But what&apos;s annoying is that Google doesn&apos;t do any meaningful thermal management — even on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> generation — and that makes these devices prone to throttling and overheating.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV" name="google-pixel-9-with-buds-pro-2-peony-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Peony pink Google Pixel 9 next to the pink Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the arbitrary feature gating; most global models of the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL include a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> modem, but the phones sold in India use an older Wi-Fi 6 modem. All other flagships sold in the country have Wi-Fi 7 as standard, but Google decided to not bother.</p><p>Even on the global version, Google randomly decided to not include features like 8K video and Night Sight video on the standard model, limiting these to the Pro variants. In a similar vein, the base models still come with 128GB of storage, and that&apos;s ridiculous in 2024; even mid-range phones now start at 256GB, and at this point, Google is just nickel-and-diming customers in this regard.</p><p>Hilariously, the base models of the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have an unnecessary 16GB of RAM and woefully inadequate 128GB of storage, and there isn&apos;t another brand that offers this configuration. It&apos;s clear that Google is trying to emulate Apple, and is using a similar pricing strategy to upsell storage variants.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="scfUdVxyWnHitQpX3n7tQh" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-06-display.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scfUdVxyWnHitQpX3n7tQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s also the question of pricing; the Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 and the 9 Pro XL at $1,099, and that&apos;s for phones with 128GB of storage; you&apos;ll need to pay another $100 to get 256GB models of these devices, and Google doesn&apos;t have anywhere as generous trade-in offers as Samsung.</p><p>Granted, these are minor irritants, but they matter on a flagship. There really isn&apos;t much to distinguish most flagships these days — at least on the hardware front — so every misstep is amplified. Google says its devices are the best at AI — and they are — and so it&apos;s asking a premium. Again, that&apos;s justified; ultimately, it&apos;s down to the brand to dictate what its phones cost.</p><p>But Google needs to understand that if it wants to price its phones in line with Apple and Samsung, it needs to deliver equivalent features; I&apos;m just not sure it is doing that.</p>

<ul><li>Google has launched the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL in India.</li><li>Thankfully, all three models are available in a single variant with 256GB of storage.</li><li>The Pixel 9 and 9 Pro don't cost that much more than their predecessors.</li><li>Google also introduced the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in the country, and that will set you back ₹1,72,999 ($2,061).</li></ul>
<p>Google unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 generation</a> earlier than usual this year, and the brand also showcased the awkwardly-named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. There are a lot of differences this time around, and I&apos;m not just talking about the accelerated launch — the Pixels have a new design language with flat sides that makes them look like an iPhone, and there are three models: the standard Pixel 9, a Pixel 9 Pro that has the same dimensions as the regular model but with a telephoto lens at the back, and a Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>If you&apos;ve used a Pro model in the Pixel series in the past, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is what you&apos;ll need to get. With the foldable, that makes four new devices. Outside of the differences with the design, Google is changing how it&apos;s selling phones in India; it just started assembling the Pixel 8 series locally, and it may do the same with the Pixel 9.</p><p>As a result, there isn&apos;t a noticeable increase in pricing from last year. The Pixel 9 is sold in a 12GB/256GB model and is available for ₹79,999 ($953), and that&apos;s actually less than the equivalent Pixel 8, which debuted at ₹82,999 ($989). The Pixel 9 Pro costs ₹1,09,999 ($1,310) for the 12GB/256GB model, and while it is marginally more than the ₹1,06,999 ($1,275) asking price of the Pixel 8 Pro last year, that phone was only sold in a 128GB model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-rose-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL, meanwhile, debuts at ₹1,24,999 ($1,489) for the 16GB/256GB model, and that&apos;s on par with what the Galaxy S24 Ultra costs in the country. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold, meanwhile, is available at ₹1,72,999 ($2,061), making it the costliest foldable in the country — the Galaxy Z Fold 6 retails for ₹1,64,999 ($1,966).</p><p>What I like about Google&apos;s positioning is that all models come with 256GB of storage as standard. However, there are no other variants available, and if you want more storage, there isn&apos;t an alternative. I don&apos;t understand why Google does this year after year — surely, it isn&apos;t too hard to have all colors and storage variants of a phone available.</p><p>Anyway, if you&apos;re interested in a new Pixel, you should just get the Pixel 8 series; the standard Pixel 8 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/google-pixel-8-hazel-128-gb/p/itm67e2a2531aaac?pid=MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ">currently discounted to ₹58,999 ($703)</a>, and that is a good value considering what&apos;s on offer. While I think the Pixel 9 is decent in its own right, it isn&apos;t worth an additional ₹21,000.</p><p>Pixels never sold well in India in the past, and I don&apos;t see that changing with the Pixel 9 generation. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is unlikely to find any takers; foldables are still a niche, and while Chinese manufacturers are making inroads in this category, I can&apos;t see anyone shelling out more than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to pick up what Google is offering.</p>

<ul><li>An early demo following an APK dive surfaces additional details regarding Google's "Audio search" for Circle to Search.</li><li>Details in the Google app's recent beta shows that Circle to Search can listen in on your device's music while also accepting humming and singing for queries.</li><li>Other information states that Google plans on bringing a split screen mode to Circle to Search for Pixel devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google hammers away at more AI software for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>; however, there&apos;s more in store for its convenient search feature.</p><p>We&apos;ve been expecting Circle to Search to pick up audio lookup for a while, and a demo by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-audio-search-first-look-3470398/">Android Authority</a> takes it for a spin. An APK dive into the latest beta version (15.32.36) of the Google app shows how this feature, "Audio Search," might work in a stable release.</p><p>From <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/uerc9sZJjTA">the demo</a>, producing Circle to Search will display a new music note beside the search text box. Tapping it will overlay a graphic on top of your current display. If you&apos;ve hit play on Spotify or another listening service, Circle to Search will use that for your query.</p><p>The software will listen in for a few seconds before switching your display to the Google app&apos;s search results. The song&apos;s title will pop into the text field at the top, as well.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the latest beta builds upon previous suspicions by showing the company&apos;s plans to let users "sing or hum" a song on this screen. This is similar to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-search-for-a-song-on-youtube-by-singing-or-humming">Search a Song</a>" in the Google app or YouTube Music, accessible by hitting the microphone icon or Search in the latter app. Users can play, hum, or sing a song for music-based queries.</p><p>The publication states that Google may display a quick bubble when opening Circle to Search <em>after </em>this feature arrives for informative reasons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:546px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.89%;"><img id="9M96B5kHoMqNagUhxsBdHT" name="google-circle-to-search-audio-search-feature-leak.jpg" alt="An APK dive leaks Google's "Audio search" functionality for Circle to Search early." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9M96B5kHoMqNagUhxsBdHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="546" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was first speculated that Google was developing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/circle-to-search-audio-lookup-spotted">an audio lookup feature</a> for Circle to Search in June. Back then, the feature was awfully barebones, only offering a quick glimpse at the music note icon that would signify its availability. Moreover, it still doesn&apos;t seem as though Google will let users attach a text-based add-on to their query <em>before </em>the software runs its search.</p><p>The demo suggests users can alter the lookup afterward, which might have to do. Despite the feature advancing between beta versions, there&apos;s no telling when users could see this rollout.</p><p>In other news, there&apos;s a chance Google will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">bring split-screen support</a> to its search function. Shortly after Android 15 Beta 1.2, it was discovered that Pixel phones could be in line for this QoL (quality of life) addition. Samsung devices don&apos;t suffer from this lack of support, which could indicate a simple lapse during software development on Google&apos;s side.</p>

This year, Google had quite a bit of hardware to show off, including a total of four smartphones, as well as a new smartwatch and some earbuds. And, of course, it&apos;s not a Google event without a few hundred mentions of AI or Gemini.</p><p>Hopefully, you&apos;ve been following our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-event-2024-live-blog-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-3-gemini-and-everything-else-we-expect-to-see">Made by Google 2024 live blog</a> so you don&apos;t miss out on all the fun, but here&apos;s a quick roundup of everything that was announced.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-9-9-pro-and-9-pro-xl-2">Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, Google launched not one, not two, but three mainline Pixel 9 phones. The best part is that you can get a larger Pixel 9 Pro XL and a smaller Pixel 9 Pro, which matches the size of the regular Pixel 9. This way, you have a choice of size for your next Pro device.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> has some fun colors and a new design language that could be seen as an evolution of the Pixel style we&apos;ve seen in recent years. The display, frame, and back panel are completely flat, while the new floating camera visor mostly retains the iconic Pixel design cues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-rose-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Underneath, the phones are powered by the Tensor G4 chipset, which boosts AI performance and more. The base model has 12GB of RAM, while the Pro phones have 16GB of RAM, more than enough to juggle apps and handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> processing.</p><p>The cameras also received some upgrades, with a new ultrawide sensor for better low-light capture and improved selfie cameras. There are also tons of new AI camera features for users to take advantage of, such as Add Me, which lets users add themselves to photos, and upgrades to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, which can enable 8K video on the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">preorder the Pixel 9 series now</a>, starting at $799.

<h2 id="pixel-9-pro-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-obsidian-porcelain-side-by-side-angle-closer.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Porcelain and Obsidian face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of a Pixel Fold 2, Google unveiled a rather different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Evolving from the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">original foldable</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold adopts a similar design language to the Pixel 9 series, sporting a thin, flat chassis. The camera housing has changed from a bar to a more rectangular shape, and the device comes in only two colors.</p><p>The external screen is the same 6.3 inches as the Pixel 9 Pro, while the internal display is now a large 8-inch panel, bringing a more expansive view of content and apps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-prompt-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, unlike the last model, which ran a slightly outdated chipset, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes with the same Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, making it quite a powerful phone.</p><p>You&apos;ll get all the same AI features as the Pixel 9 series, although the camera specs aren&apos;t as robust. The primary camera is a 48MP sensor, while the other cameras come with 10MP resolutions. Still, you should be able to take some great photos thanks to Google&apos;s phenomenal computational photography.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-preorder-deals">preorder the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> with a starting price of $1799 and two available color options. The phone should ship in September.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-watch-3-2">Pixel Watch 3</h2>

<p>The third iteration of Google&apos;s Pixel Watch may look exactly like its predecessors, but there are some notable changes and upgrades. Even though it has the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> now comes in two different sizes: 41mm and 45mm. The bezels around the displays are also smaller, meaning you get a more immersive smartwatch experience and more room to play with apps and such.</p><p>Google has also included plenty of new fitness features aimed at runners, allowing users to create their own custom running routines and follow guides to warm up or cool down. Fitbit also now has new readiness and cardio load scores to help you prepare for the day and learn how hard you&apos;re pushing yourself during workouts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1614px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="YSHercLpApdM8cDrDW6SSJ" name="google-pixel-watch-3-official-render-nest-tile.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 3 Official Render - Nest Tile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YSHercLpApdM8cDrDW6SSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1614" height="907" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Years after Google&apos;s first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a> hit the market, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> land with a new Tensor A1 chip. This promises to bring enhanced audio quality, better ANC, and long battery life. There are also features like Clear Calling and Automatic Conversation Detection, which reduce background noise in calls and pause music when you&apos;re talking.</p><p>The Buds Pro 2 have exceptional battery life, with 12 hours per charge without ANC and 8 hours with it on. The earbuds also support Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> network, so you can locate them easily.</p><p>These are also the first earbuds to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> support, so you can access the AI assistant from your buds without needing to remove or unlock your phone.</p><p>You can preorder the Pixel Buds Pro 2 now for $299.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-and-other-ai-features-2">Gemini and other AI features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-01.jpg" alt="Talking to Gemini Live on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini is getting plenty of upgrades. Google provided a new demo of Gemini Live, a conversational assistant coming to Pixel phones. The assistant allows users to have more natural-sounding conversations, which can help them come up with new ideas. The demo was pretty impressive, and Gemini Live is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">going live on Pixel 9 devices</a> starting today, August 13, for users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a>.</p><p>Gemini can also be used to identify anything on your Pixel&apos;s screen.</p>

<p>In addition to Gemini, Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio also bring new helpful and impressive AI capabilities. The former stores your screenshots and analyzes the information on device so that you can recall things later. The latter allows you to type prompts to create images, and it&apos;s even good at generating legible text on these images.</p><p>The new Call Notes feature will record and transcribe/summarize your calls.
