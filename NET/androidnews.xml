<ul><li>Samsung is only months away from launching new smartwatches, and they’ve appeared in new FCC listings. </li><li>The model numbers appear to match the standard Galaxy Watch 7, but not the rumored Galaxy Watch 7 Pro variant.</li><li>Instead, the FCC listings could indicate the long-speculated Galaxy Watch FE is nearing a launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Leaks and rumors around the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 series</a> are heating up, but we just got official confirmation that new smartwatches are coming in the way of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=Y&application_id=zbnNiYP2Den8e4GS3bLJ8w%3D%3D&fcc_id=A3LSMR861" target="_blank">Federal Communications Commission (FCC) listings</a>. Every new product that comes out with wireless connectivity, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular, must be registered and approved by the FCC. There were new listings tied to Samsung for a “smart wearable” device, and there is a strong likelihood that these are upcoming Galaxy Watches. </p><p>The listings, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/05/17/galaxy-watch-7-stops-through-fcc-galaxy-watch-fe-too/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>, cover the following model numbers: SM-L300, SM-L305, SM-L310, SM-L315, and SM-R861. This aligns with prior leaks and what we’ve seen in previous filings. Last month, Samsung had to file paperwork with the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-bluetooth-certification#:~:text=The%20model%20number%2C%20SM%2DL305U,the%20current%20Galaxy%20Watch%206.">Galaxy Watch 7 will use the Bluetooth 5.3 spec</a>. The first four model numbers filed with the FCC match the ones that appeared in the Bluetooth SIG filings earlier. </p><p>Though the FCC filings only officially list these devices as ”smart wearables” from Samsung, that isn’t surprising. Companies try to keep the exact device they’re listing under wraps, but a specific FCC requirement usually reveals more about these devices. When registering a device, companies need to explain how users can find the regulatory information on that device. In this case, Samsung says that regulatory info is found on the About Watch page, confirming that these models are indeed Galaxy Watches. </p>

<p>We’ve already seen the model numbers for the Galaxy Watch 7 before, which represent the first four model numbers in the above list. These account for both watch sizes (40mm or 44mm) and both connectivity options (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + LTE). As such, there doesn’t appear to be any confirmation of the rumored Galaxy Watch 7 Pro or even something like a Galaxy Watch 7 Classic based on these listings. </p><p>The last model number, SM-R861, is perhaps the most interesting. It doesn’t align with Samsung‘s typical model numbering scheme for flagship Galaxy Watch devices. This is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-likely-to-bring-galaxy-watch-fe-soon">likely the Galaxy Watch FE</a>, or whatever Samsung plans to call its budget Galaxy Watch wearable. It could be called the Galaxy Watch FE or the Galaxy Watch 4 (2024), according to leaks. The latter option may be correct, as the Galaxy Watch 4 model numbering starts with SM-R860, just like the unnamed wearable that appeared in FCC listings.</p><p>We’re going to find out more about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 lineup, and perhaps a budget Galaxy Watch model, at Samsung Unpacked this summer. We’ll also probably hear about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, which was previewed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>. </p>

<ul><li>People who both upgraded to the Android 15 beta and have an eligible T-Mobile plan are now seeing a page in settings for satellite messaging. </li><li>This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this menu for satellite messaging, but it’s the first time it has actually appeared in working form for users. </li><li>Previous reports revealed that T-Mobile and Starlink were partnering to support satellite messaging on 15 Android devices. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>So far, the biggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> feature revealed to date is likely satellite messaging. There have been countless leaks and rumors regarding the feature, which still hasn’t been officially confirmed by Google, even after its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a> developer conference. However, the closest thing we’ve gotten to an official confirmation just happened — people running the Android 15 beta on a device with T-Mobile cellular service are now being informed about satellite messaging, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/satellite-messaging-t-mobile-android-15-3444192/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reported.</p><p>A few T-Mobile users took to Reddit to share the new settings menu that appeared on their Android 15 device. It’s called <strong>Satellite Messaging</strong>, and it can be accessed by navigating through <strong>Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs > T-Mobile</strong> on devices running Android 15 Beta 2. Though some have managed to force show the Satellite Messaging menu in previous versions of Android 15, the settings page is only starting to appear by default in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-just-landed-for-google-pixels-and-non-pixel-devices-too">Android 15 Beta 2</a>. </p><p>Here’s what the Satellite Messaging page will look like in Android 15, as shared by u/erichola on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1ct1no1/satellite_messaging_option_appeared_on_my_pixel_7">Satellite messaging option appeared on my Pixel 7. </a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile">r/tmobile</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Under the <strong>About satellite messaging</strong> section, there’s a sentence explaining how and if T-Mobile customers can take advantage of satellite messaging in Android 15. “You can send and receive text messages by satellite as part of an eligible T-Mobile account,“ it reads. While we don’t know what T-Mobile plans are supported right now, we do know that the user in question has T-Mobile’s Magenta plan. As such, we can assume that Magenta users will likely be able to use Android 15 satellite messaging without paying extra.</p><p>Notably, there don’t seem to be any restrictions on when and how satellite messaging can be used on Android 15. Many satellite-based features launched in the past are specifically designed to be used in an emergency. Satellite messaging on Android 15 is unique in that it appears to work anytime Wi-Fi and cellular are unavailable, and not limited to those dire situations.</p><p>T-Mobile already announced a partnership with Starlink, and plans to launch text messaging by satellite at some point this year. This is probably the reason why the carrier is the first to appear in the Android 15 settings app. Other carriers may appear in the future, and AT&T is already working on a satellite messaging strategy of its own. As Android Authority surmised, the Android 15 settings menu for satellite messaging doesn’t look like it is unique or exclusive to T-Mobile.</p><p>The presence of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-beta-satellite-messaging-spotted">satellite messaging</a> in the settings menu all but confirms it is coming in Android 15. However, users likely won’t be able to actually use it until their carrier rolls out support for satellite messaging. </p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome found testing a new flag for iOS devices that will enable Circle to Search.</li><li>It appears to be an updated version of Google Lens Search for iOS handsets.</li><li>Previously, similar functionality appeared through the Google Search app via a new shortcut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Circle to Search appears to be expanding to more devices, according to new findings from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macobserver.com/ios/google-chrome-for-ios-will-soon-get-circle-to-search-feature/">The Mac Observer</a>. This comes after the recent findings of Circle to Search being spotted on iOS devices through the Google Search app&apos;s shortcut workaround.</p><p>Per the publication&apos;s latest findings, Google is working on an updated version of Google Lens Search for iOS dubbed "LensOverlay," the supposed bundle will likely bring the popular Circle to Search feature. And, it will be incorporated into Google Chrome for iOS handsets through a flag dubbed "Lens Circle to Search."</p>

<p>When enabled, iPhone users can search for anything on their screens by circling or squiggling them, provided they are doing so in the Google Chrome app. The Mac Observer further notes that it can be accessible through the Google Lens app on the iOS handsets.</p><p>While it is unclear when the feature will roll out officially, it is believed to venture soon for iOS handsets. It still needs to be determined for iPad users whether this incorporation is part of a recent report, which suggested Apple was in talks with Google to bring its Gemini model to iPhones.</p>
<p>The new spotting is followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-workaround-for-iphones">recent workaround</a> through the Google Search app, which allowed iPhone users like the iPhone 15 Pro to assign their Action Button to launch Google Lens, which lets users scan their current screen. </p><p>While it&apos;s not the same methodology as Circle to Search, it still effectively completes the same job. It is not just for the latest iPhones; it also works for iPhones without an Action Button. Instead, they have to dig into their accessibility settings and look for double tap/triple tap at the back shortcut, enabling users to screenshot their current screen and open up the new Google Lens shortcut for analysis.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>After a brief hiatus, Xiaomi reentered the tablet segment with the launch of the Pad 6 last year. That particular model was aimed at the mid-range category, and continues to be a solid choice if you want a large tablet with powerful hardware and stellar battery life. The brand&apos;s more recent Pad 6s Pro 12.4 has even better hardware and a 3K panel with 144Hz.</p><p>But Xiaomi is always at its best when making budget products, and this is true when it comes to tablets as well; last year&apos;s Redmi Pad was one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best budget tablets</a> around, and the latest Redmi Pad SE has a few tweaks to the design and upgraded hardware. Xiaomi is building on that foundation with the introduction of the Redmi Pad Pro, which has a larger 12.1-inch panel with an increased QHD resolution, 10000mAh battery, and a new design that uses aluminum liberally.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting is that Xiaomi has retained the 3.5mm jack and MicroSD slot, and the Redmi Pad Pro is still aimed at the budget segment, making it one of the best value-focused tablets you can buy today. My favorite feature is that it runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box; Xiaomi has been underhanded in this regard, launching several devices — including the Redmi Pad SE and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro+</a> — with Android 13 so it wouldn&apos;t have to roll out as many software updates, and that thankfully isn&apos;t an issue with the Redmi Pad Pro.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to buy a budget tablet with a massive screen, here&apos;s why the Redmi Pad Pro may just be the best option currently available.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi Pad Pro in China on April 10, 2024, and the tablet made its global debut on May 20. It is available in three configurations: a base model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, an 8GB/128GB version, and a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>Xiaomi sells the Redmi Pad Pro with the keyboard case and stylus as a bundle in China, but that isn&apos;t the case in global markets. The tablet starts at £269 ($340) for the 6GB/128GB version in the U.K., going up to £299 ($380) for the 8GB/256GB model. Xiaomi is bundling a case as well as the Redmi Buds 5 with every order in the U.K. The stylus costs an additional £59 ($75), and the Redmi Smart Keyboard is debuting at £89 ($113).</p><p>In other countries in the region, the Redmi Pad Pro is set to start off at €299 ($325), with pre-orders kicking off May 21 and general availability from June 3. Xiaomi will launch the tablet in India, but as of now, there&apos;s no telling when that will be the case.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-pad-pro-design"><span>Redmi Pad Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zSrfWgwC3xuYNEgfGyBNrT" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-1.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro with keyboard case on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSrfWgwC3xuYNEgfGyBNrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Redmi Pad SE has a distinct resemblance to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-12-pro-review">Xiaomi 12 series</a>, and while the Redmi Pad Pro has a similar aesthetic, the new camera housing is visually distinctive. The oversized rings around the camera evoke memories of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a>, and they dominate attention at the back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="APt7puh4HP7cnpVDUTaScZ" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-21.jpg" alt="Detailed view of the rear cameras of the Redmi Pad Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APt7puh4HP7cnpVDUTaScZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a single 8MP camera at the back, so the LED flash gets the same adornment, and considering the camera lens and flash module are rather small, the outsizes housing looks almost comical. But what matters is that it doesn&apos;t protrude too much from the chassis, so there is no wobble when using the Redmi Pad Pro on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="u2DcQAa7egQHncpGbP9JrX" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-14.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro volume button on the right side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u2DcQAa7egQHncpGbP9JrX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi sells the Redmi Pad Pro in three color variants — Grey, Mint Green, and Ocean Blue — and the green and blue models have very subtle pastel shades. That&apos;s understandable given that tablet designs tend to be more conservative, and to Xiaomi&apos;s credit, there are absolutely no issues with the build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x2XbgFFVYJG3MjyQh6KmLX" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-13.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro's Dolby Vision branding" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2XbgFFVYJG3MjyQh6KmLX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the tablet is aimed at the budget segment, you get an aluminum chassis that feels great to hold and use. The rounded edges and beveled sides make a big difference in this area, and while it is heavy at 571g, the tablet balances the weight evenly, so it doesn&apos;t get uncomfortable with extended use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZcpjmHf8puS4VbTyevA74Y" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-15.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro bottom view with 2.5mm jack and USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZcpjmHf8puS4VbTyevA74Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power button is located at the top, with the volume buttons on the right. You don&apos;t get the ability to slot in a SIM card and connect to cellular networks, but there is a MicroSD slot that lets you extend the storage by an additional 1.5TB. What I like is that the Redmi Pad Pro has a 3.5mm jack, and there are no issues when using IEMs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19</a>.</p><p>On the audio side of things, Xiaomi offers four speakers on the Redmi Pad Pro — two on either side — and they sound great in their own right. Overall, the tablet gets a lot right on the design front, and it doesn&apos;t feel like a budget product.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-pad-pro-screen"><span>Redmi Pad Pro: Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rFMpaSQ5SKsmJeLpGQvPbW" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-9.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro home page with icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rFMpaSQ5SKsmJeLpGQvPbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Redmi Pad Pro comes with a 12.1-inch IPS LCD panel that is ideal for streaming content. The panel has a resolution of 2560 x 1600 with a standard 16:10 ratio, and it has Dolby Vision integration and a layer of Gorilla Glass 3. The maximum brightness isn&apos;t particularly high at 500 nits, but I didn&apos;t have any issues using the Redmi Pad Pro outdoors. The tablet goes up to 600 nits in HBM mode, but there&apos;s no noticeable difference when streaming videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kgxJextjSzjBC4XwCTCw2V" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-4.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro's keyboard case docked to the tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgxJextjSzjBC4XwCTCw2V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the Redmi Pad Pro has Widevine L1, and it is able to stream 1080p and HDR content from the likes of Netflix and YouTube without any hassle. While color fidelity isn&apos;t obviously as good as an OLED panel, the Redmi Pad Pro has plenty to offer in this area, and Xiaomi&apos;s factory calibration continues to be among the best around. The default Vivid mode has vibrant colors and good contrast, and you can tweak the color balance according to your tastes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pE8cFTczZfuGchfCxRxdNY" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-17.jpg" alt="Bezels on the Redmi Pad Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pE8cFTczZfuGchfCxRxdNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Larger tablets are great for reading, and the Redmi Pad Pro includes Xiaomi&apos;s excellent Reading mode. The feature allows you to change the intensity of the colors, or switch to a monochrome palette, and this is ideal if you want to read an e-book. The tablet is decent enough when it comes to playing games as well — you can connect a Bluetooth controller with ease — but the hardware doesn&apos;t have as much grunt, limiting the potential to enjoy demanding titles.</p><p>The best part about the screen on the Redmi Pad Pro is that it has a 120Hz refresh rate; navigating the UI is smooth, and the difference is noticeable even when switching from the 90Hz Redmi Pad SE. That said, you&apos;ll need to go into the settings to enable 120Hz mode, as it is set to Auto out of the box.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nPkF3zhVp8nuf8fkX4ZFaY" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-16.jpg" alt="Camera of the Redmi Pad Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nPkF3zhVp8nuf8fkX4ZFaY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t have any issues with the panel on the Redmi Pad Pro, and my only quibble has to do with the considerable bezels around the screen. I get that this is a budget tablet, but Xiaomi should have done more to trim the bezels. Talking about the bezels, the front camera is located on the leading edge, and while it isn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve used, it holds up well in video calls.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-pad-pro-hardware"><span>Redmi Pad Pro: Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WexdwMVPzUAB6F2zedyYCa" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-23.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro about device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WexdwMVPzUAB6F2zedyYCa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi outfitted the Redmi Pad Pro with a Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, and although the chipset is good enough in daily use, it isn&apos;t exactly powerful. I noticed lag sporadically in mundane tasks like browsing in Chrome or switching between apps, and while it doesn&apos;t hinder usability too much, it is irksome.</p>
<p>The memory and storage modules are similarly dated, with Xiaomi using LPDDR4X modules with both the 6GB and 8GB models, and UFS 2.2 storage across the board. Thankfully, there&apos;s Wi-Fi 6 this time around, and you get Bluetooth 5.2. There&apos;s no NFC, you don&apos;t get any high-res codecs, and there&apos;s no ingress protection.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, you don&apos;t get fingerprint authentication on the Redmi Pad Pro either; you&apos;ll need to use face unlock or the usual passcode to log in to the device, and that&apos;s annoying. Xiaomi uses a side-mounted fingerprint reader that&apos;s baked into the power button on plenty of its budget and mid-range phones, and that would have been ideal on the tablet. That said, face unlock has been reliable, and while it isn&apos;t as secure,</p><p>The cameras are strictly average as well, and outside of video calls, the 8MP camera at the front doesn&apos;t have much utility. The 8MP camera at the back has a dedicated Night mode and takes usable shots in daylight, but you&apos;re better off using your phone cameras instead.</p><p>Switching over to the battery, the Redmi Pad Pro has a 10000mAh unit that is among the largest in this segment. I haven&apos;t used the tablet enough to judge battery life, but in less than a week of usage, it has lasted considerably longer than the Redmi Pad SE and any other budget tablet I used recently. I also like the fact that it has 33W charging, and while it takes nearly two hours to charge, it is noticeably faster than the 18W tech that Xiaomi offers on the rest of its budget tablets.</p>

<p>Xiaomi sells two accessories with the Redmi Pad Pro: a standard folio case that has decent protection, and a keyboard accessory dubbed the Redmi Smart Keyboard. I used the Xiaomi Pad 6 extensively with its keyboard case, and Xiaomi is doing things a bit differently with the Redmi Pad Pro; the case doesn&apos;t connect to the tablet using pogo pins at the back, instead relying on Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Pairing the case to the Redmi Pad Pro is about as seamless as it gets; there&apos;s a toggle on the right that enables Bluetooth connectivity, and it automatically shows up in the device list. The case securely holds the Redmi Pad Pro, and the keys have good tactility. There&apos;s no backlighting, but outside of that, the Redmi Smart Keyboard nails the basics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wxyVCHdUcMxDwNh2QmfX8W" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-7.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro stylus attachment" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wxyVCHdUcMxDwNh2QmfX8W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other accessory is a stylus called the Redmi Smart Pen, and it is similarly decent. It has 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity, and there&apos;s no noticeable latency when using the stylus to take notes or doodle. The bundled sketching utility is pretty basic, but you can use something like Infinite Painter and make detailed sketches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qsxpxkF6L8SZ9Ltxw799PW" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-8.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro stylus charges via USB-C" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsxpxkF6L8SZ9Ltxw799PW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the stylus itself is quite good, it doesn&apos;t attach magnetically to the Redmi Pad Pro, and that limits its usability. I also noticed connectivity issues, and had to toggle the Bluetooth modem on the tablet to be able to use the stylus again. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-pad-pro-software"><span>Redmi Pad Pro: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="arVTVf3G87TEfEsfSVxVqZ" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-22.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro's multitasking highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/arVTVf3G87TEfEsfSVxVqZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t too much to talk about on the software side of things, with Xiaomi offering HyperOS 1.0.3.0 based on Android 14 out of the box. That in itself is a big deal, as Xiaomi has thus far been unwilling to pre-install Android 14 on its 2024 budget devices.</p><p>You get most of the same features as the phone build, and there is a decent amount of customizability. Xiaomi doesn&apos;t include many tablet-focused utilities; you still get a split notification pane with the toggles accessible via the right side, and there isn&apos;t a gesture to launch split-screen multitasking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z3mdbCL49vbMkNHAqGdBsW" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-10.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro notification pane Control Center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z3mdbCL49vbMkNHAqGdBsW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You will need to press down on an app card within the overview menu and select the mode manually, but once you pull up two windows side-by-side, you can easily resize and change the width of each window, and close both at the same time. The overview menu uses Xiaomi&apos;s standard vertical configuration, and there isn&apos;t a setting to switch it to horizontal scrolling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4G46ZcqCUQNRqFvT4mjP5X" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-11.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro's notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4G46ZcqCUQNRqFvT4mjP5X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The leftmost pane shows Google&apos;s Discover feed, and there&apos;s no way to disable it. The interface is in need of a visual overhaul, but it is better optimized than MIUI; Xiaomi now needs to turn its attention to polishing the visuals. On the whole, it is easy to navigate and use, and although there is a lot of overt styling, it isn&apos;t anywhere as cumbersome as previous versions of the skin. My biggest quibble is that the toggles in the Control Center don&apos;t have any labels.</p>
<p>When it comes to updates, the Redmi Pad Pro will get two platform updates along with three years of security updates. That is in line with other budget tablets, but considering Xiaomi&apos;s lackadaisical attitude when it comes to platform updates, the tablet is unlikely to make the switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> sometime this year — or even in Q1 2025. That said, at least you&apos;ll get the update at some point, as well as Android 16 when that becomes available.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-pad-pro-the-competition"><span>Redmi Pad Pro: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QsWHSKHcrAirELZcyzbRia" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-25.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro next to Redmi Pad SE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QsWHSKHcrAirELZcyzbRia.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no shortage of budget tablets, and if you&apos;re looking to maximize value, Xiaomi&apos;s Redmi Pad SE ticks a lot of the right boxes. It also has a large screen, and while the hardware isn&apos;t as powerful as the Redmi Pad Pro and you miss out on the accessories, it is much more affordable. </p><p>If you need powerful hardware, the Xiaomi Pad 6 is still a great choice in 2024. It has a brighter panel, is terrific at gaming, and while the battery doesn&apos;t last as long, it has a leg up over the Redmi Pad Pro in all other areas.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-pad-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Redmi Pad Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPpbjryeHPrgNP2inxhrRa" name="redmi-pad-pro-review-24.jpg" alt="Redmi Pad Pro home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPpbjryeHPrgNP2inxhrRa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a large tablet</li><li>You want the best battery life in this segment</li><li>You want a good keyboard accessory</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need biometric authentication</li><li>You want long-term updates</li></ul>
<p>Xiaomi did all the right things with the Redmi Pad Pro. The switch to a larger screen, 120Hz panel, and increasing the battery size gives the tablet a distinct advantage over the Redmi Pad SE. While it won&apos;t dethrone the iPad, it is noticeably better to use than most budget tablets, and that in itself is a sizeable achievement.</p><p>The Redmi Pad Pro does a great job at the basics, and while you don&apos;t get the accessories bundled with the tablet, the keyboard is worth the investment if you need a budget tablet for productivity. In a similar vein, the stylus is a good choice if you want to sketch on the go.</p><p>I don&apos;t have many negatives to share; the hardware isn&apos;t ideal for gaming, and the lack of a secure authentication system is irksome. But outside of that, there really isn&apos;t much missing here, and if you need a reliable budget tablet with a 12.1-inch screen, the Redmi Pad Pro is a standout option.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google TV will be gaining Android 14 TV OS with new features.</li><li>The new version promises improvements in performance, sustainability, accessibility, and multitasking.</li><li>Next to the new update, there are new Gen AI recommendations to look forward to.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google TV users are in for a treat as the search giant has announced that Android 14 is coming to their smart television sets alongside the smartness of Gen AI. </p><p>Through an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/android-14-and-compose-on-tv.html">accompanying blog post</a>, the new Android version for devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast with Google TV</a> promises improvements in performance, sustainability, accessibility, and multitasking to help users have a more engaging TV experience. </p><p>The indicated performance improvements promise to bring "a snappier, more responsive TV experience." Google is also adding a handful of energy modes that will help users save power consumption when their TVs are in standby mode. These will primarily comprise of three modes: low energy, optimized energy, and increased energy mode, which are clearly illustrated in the image shared by Google in the announcement post (attached below).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1358px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.18%;"><img id="CHpGLhuZGxWDDuEGciNwNH" name="google-tv-enegry-saving-modes-01.jpg" alt="Google TV new energy modes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHpGLhuZGxWDDuEGciNwNH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1358" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The updates further add new accessibility features such as color correction, enhanced text options, and improved user navigation. These can be turned on or off per user preferences with the help of remote shortcuts. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/here-are-all-android-tv-devices-google-tv">Google TV</a> users with the new software can expect better multitasking as Picture-in-Picture support is coming to all Android 14-supported TVs. </p><p>Google has further shared little guides for developers on incorporating the new features on their apps that will help users take full advantage of the new operating system upgrade. As such, the search giant is also releasing Compose for TV in <strong>1.0.0-beta01</strong> for developers, which helps them build apps in new ways. </p>

<p>In addition to these improvements, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">Gen AI</a> will further bring nifty additions to Google TV users to help improve their watching experience. For instance, if a movie or TV show doesn&apos;t have a description on the Featured carousel on the home screen on Google TV, it will now showcase AI-generated descriptions (based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> model) for the movie or TV show and tell users what to watch. </p><p>These AI-generated content descriptions are also more personalized based on users&apos; preferred actor and genre. They can also be seen in users&apos; preferred native language. </p><p>The other highlights include quickly pairing the Google TV to wireless headphones or speakers with a single tap with the help of Fast Pair.</p>

He was the eldest of our friend group and the only one at the time who had a license and a car. He had something else none of us had at the time: a boomin’ system. Two 10-inch subwoofers in a beautifully crafted speaker box, complete with amps, crossover, and any other technology the late 80’s had to offer. The bass his twin tens put out was so aggressive when maxed that you could almost feel it messing with your heart rhythms when you sat in the back seat. That is not hyperbole.</p><p>When I first donned the new Sony ULT Wear wireless noise-canceling headphones and pressed Play on my “Bass Test” playlist, I immediately started smiling like the Cheshire Cat. The ridiculous (in a good way) bass response immediately evoked nostalgia for that late 80s and early 90s trunk-rattling boom bap. *If your system was high caliber, your trunk didn’t rattle btw.</p><p>Bass like this isn’t for everyone, so it’s a good thing that Sony put some thought into ULT Wear, creating a pair of noise-canceling headphones that very likely will work for most listeners. Fear not bass curmudgeons, I’ll drop bars on why you still may want to take a listen.</p>

<p>Sony’s ULT Wear headphones are widely available not only on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/all-headphones/p/whult900n-h">Sony.com</a> but also on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Canceling-Wireless-Headphones-Comfortable/dp/B0CWVXTK6Z?th=1">Amazon</a>, B&H Photo, and brick-and-mortar stores like Best Buy and Walmart. They cost $200 and are available in Black, Forest Gray, and Off-White. As a lover of all things camo, the Forest Gray variant is calling my name!</p><p>According to price tracker camelcamelcamel.com, the previous-gen WH-XB910N headphones could be purchased for less than MSRP pretty frequently, so it’s a good bet that the ULT Wear (WH-ULT900N) will soon be available for less than $200.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Where do I begin? Thinkin’ of a master plan. With nothin’ but bass inside these cans. 

Eating fish, which is my favorite dish, I began my review with a bass playlist!</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Okay, enough riffing on Rakim and “Paid in Full,” which just happened to be one of the first songs I had banging through the specially designed 40mm drivers on these closed-back over-ear headphones. What makes these headphones different from Sony’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">venerable WH-1000XM5</a> is their focus on earth-shattering bass response, but they also share some features with the XM5, like the V1 Processor chip. The model for these headphones is WH-ULT900N, so technically, they’re the successor to and share some DNA with a product in Sony’s ExtraBass lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/treat-your-ears-best-buy-has-cut-dollar100-off-the-bass-heavy-sony-wh-xb910n">WH-XB910N</a>.</p><p>I’m glad Sony moved the focus away from a model number and went with ULT, which is short for "Ultimate." That makes remembering the name much more straightforward. To help give you a memorable experience, Sony <em>packed</em> the $200 ULT Wear with features. They’re running Bluetooth 5.2, and along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> like SBC and AAC, you’ll get Sony’s LDAC codec carrying your tunes. If you want to slip into something higher resolution, you can connect via aux cable to your audio source, provided you have the proper dongle or mobile DAC. </p><p>The ULT Wear have active noise canceling onboard, which Sony says is improved over the previous generation. Like the ULT modes, you can access and change ANC modes with a button on the left earcup. You&apos;ll also find the power button and all ports there. The large, thick, thermo-foam earpads on the ULTs are quite comfortable and do a decent job providing passive noise cancellation. The companion app also has a feature that will choose your level of noise cancellation based on your location and activity, which I found to be spot on in its adjustments to my environment. </p><p>Caveat emptor: You’ll need to be okay with giving Sony that level of location-based access to your life. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="77QSpirD64HcFLW3ACKjAC" name="sony-headphones-connect-app-ULT-WEAR-location-access.jpg" alt="Sony ULT WEAR Headphones Connect App" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/77QSpirD64HcFLW3ACKjAC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to noise-canceling, you also get an adjustable ambient sound mode so that you can maintain your situational awareness while listening if necessary. I keep it all the way up as that provides a level of amplification to my surroundings. However, if you only need transparency when communicating with someone, Quick Attention makes that possible by placing your hand over the right earcup, which temporarily activates ambient sound mode on the fly until you remove your hand. </p><p>I haven’t fully vetted the battery life claims just yet because these seem to go and go, but Sony says you’ll get up to 30 hours of playback with ANC on and 50 with it off. Rapid charging via USB-C gives you 1.5 hours of playback on a three-minute charge, while 10 minutes gives you five hours of playback.</p>

<h2 id="ultra-bassy-without-being-basic-2">Ultra bassy, without being basic</h2>
<p>With some specs out of the way, let’s talk about what makes these headphones the “ULTimate.” I was grinning ear-to-ear as I listened to LL Cool J’s “Going Back to Cali,” followed by N.W.A. and “Dopeman.” Masta Ace’s “Born to Roll” remix was an anthem known for being bumped from high-octane sound systems back in the day, but I also wanted some more heavily engineered sonics to sip from, so I loaded up Skrillex&apos;s “Mumbai Power” and The Roots’ “Do You Want More?!!!??!” For serious jeep-beat nostalgia, I even nodded my head to L’Trimm’s “Cars That Go Boom.” </p><p>What’s great about the ULT Wear is that none of these songs sounded muddy because of the hyped bass response. Allow me to qualify that statement, though. While not muddy, bass on ULT2 mode definitely upstages the other frequencies, but that&apos;s kind of the point here. The increase in bass also had punchy mids, which helped bring forward vocals. High frequencies weren’t washed out either, as I discovered while listening to “Mumbai Power.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tgGSkBA9SQ9esf6j2wkcqL" name="sony-ult-wear-ULT-badge-table.jpg" alt="Sony ULT WEAR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tgGSkBA9SQ9esf6j2wkcqL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big feature here is the ULT button on the left side of the headphones, which gives you three levels of bass amplification: ULT Off, ULT1, and ULT2, but there’s more customization to be had. You can fine-tune the bass response with the CLEAR BASS slider as you play with the various EQ presets or create your custom preset using the five-band EQ in conjunction with the ULT and CLEAR BASS settings.</p><p>Before you do all of that, I recommend hitting the Find Your Equalizer menu and tuning the overall sound to your hearing. Pick a song with a good balance of vocals and instrumentation, then play that while choosing from two screens of different EQ options. In my testing, this made a difference in how bass and mid-forward the overall sound signature was.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Av5z9juey4EmyW9vNr2BsB" name="sony-headphones-connect-app-ULT-WEAR-EQ.jpg" alt="Sony ULT WEAR Headphones Connect App" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Av5z9juey4EmyW9vNr2BsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With my custom EQ and ULT1 with CLEAR BASS set to +3, listening to other genres of music is enjoyable. Art Blakey’s “Moanin’” is bright and delightful, with a really solid sound separation in the stereo image. Highs are restrained as the shrill horns in this track weren’t a tad uncomfortable like they can be. Other tracks, like a remastered “Let’s Dance” by David Bowie, are immersive, and Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” is still airy, though a bit restrained in nuance as well. </p><p>To my point about customization, simply changing to the Treble Boost preset, where CLEAR BASS is set to “0” and bass enhancement is set to “ULT1,” restores some nuance back to the mix. Clarity is added to your sound by activating Sony’s Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) technology, and I feel it does a solid job of delivering just that.</p><p>While watching movies and videos, there is no latency with dialogue while connected via Bluetooth. The EQ feature set here makes it easy to customize sound so that those boomy bottoms don&apos;t hinder your enjoyment of film scores and dialog. The taiko drum scene in episode two of "Blue Eye Samurai" is definitely "warmer" through the ULT Wear, but my EQ customization keeps dialog and sword sounds bright and crisp.</p><p>Last, on the sound front, know that the upgraded microphone array in the ULT Wear will also give you a solid calling, Zoom, or Google Meet experience. They do a fine job of canceling background noise for those you&apos;re speaking to, and when you&apos;re silent, they do a solid job of muting your environment if you&apos;re out here on these streets.</p>
<h2 id="bass-by-wire-2">Bass by wire</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p7sUbtsspEK2uRmL2X4LLL" name="sony-ult-wear-FOSI-DAC-CU-table.jpg" alt="Sony ULT WEAR, Fosi D2 DAC, Pixel 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7sUbtsspEK2uRmL2X4LLL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Bluetooth LDAC experience won’t leave you wanting, and the analog experience with the 3.5mm cable is also solid. Bonus points for being able to use it when you run out of juice!</p><p>I connected the ULT Wear to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> using the included aux cable attached to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">one of the best small DACs</a> under $100, Fosi Audio&apos;s mini DS2, and was not disappointed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">Listening to hi-res audio</a> through this powerful USB-C DAC presented bright, airy, and full-bodied music for closed-back $200 headphones. I listened to Tidal tracks, as well as FLAC files, through VLC media player. Just so you know, you’ll be able to use the 3.5mm aux with the headphones powered on or off, and you’ll get two different sound signatures depending on that power state. Powered on, you get the bass-heavy profile, but the sound is more neutral when powered off.</p><p>One of the issues with bass-heavy recordings revealed by the ULT is how well producers and engineers master tracks. Listening to some hip-hop tracks, I see that there’s a bit of mud in the mix, while others have deep, resonant bass that is tight without muddying mids or highs. The Roots, Dr. Dre, Skrillex, and several other producers of heavy bass and sub-bass tracks clearly show they know how to bring the thump without dulling the vibrance of the rest of the image. Others, not so much. DSEE helps those tracks out a bit, but when actively listening, you learn the difference between quality technical engineering and rough-around-the-edges compositions from different creatives.</p><p>Speaking of quality technical engineering, I’m not a huge fan of touch controls on headphones, but the ULT WEAR’s controls are responsive and intuitive. Not only that, but the proximity sensor, responsible for controlling the ability to pause music when you remove the headphones, was equally responsive. There’s a split-second latency when removing them, but they unpause play when placed back on your head with no lag whatsoever. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sony-ult-wear-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Sony ULT Wear: What could use improvement</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tNe8rxes5ECwQJ8owDCEUM" name="sony-ult-wear-in-case-folded-table.jpg" alt="Sony ULT WEAR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tNe8rxes5ECwQJ8owDCEUM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sony has done a fine job engineering these heavy hitters, so there are only a couple of things I found that could use some improvement. First off, there is no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a> audio support. You won’t get that on the pricier 1000XM5 either, so that really is a Sony technical decision I’d like to see it changed in its next generation of headphones. That said, I do prefer using a mobile DAC, so that isn’t a huge deal for me.</p><p>I tried setting up head-tracking optimization, but I couldn’t get it to work. You have to hold the phone level in front of your face as you swivel your head up and down, not side-to-side, but I think this glorious beard is throwing that technology off. Something else that gets “thrown off” is the ability to use LDAC and multipoint at the same time. I don’t know why that is, considering that the WH-1000XM5 received an update last year, which made that possible.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sony-ult-wear-competition"><span>Sony ULT Wear: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kekHRtZ5PbrCzDa5XgPZQY" name="JBL-live-770nc.jpg" alt="JBL Live 770NC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kekHRtZ5PbrCzDa5XgPZQY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JBL)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There aren’t many options this heavy on features at $200. You can look at the JBL Live 770NC, Sennheiser Accentum Plus, or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/beats-studio-pro-launch">Beats Studio Pro</a>, which initially retailed for $350 but can frequently be found for under $200. </p><p>You should definitely check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-accentum-plus-review">Sennheiser Accentum Plus review</a> to see if those are a better match for you. Having personally tested Beats Studio Pro, I’d say that you’ll have to take a hard look at the two products. With the ULT, you’ll get LDAC, EQ customization, and other features not found on the Studio Pro. Still, some users will find that Beats has a much more balanced, nuanced sound profile without sacrificing satisfying bass response.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy Sony ULT Wear if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Bass is life.</li><li>You want comfortable, long-wearing headphones</li><li>You want a lot of features for a decent price.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy Sony ULT WEAR if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Neutral sound is life.</li><li>You need USB-C audio.</li></ul>
<p>Though a bass lover&apos;s guilty pleasure, Sony&apos;s ULT Wear present a much broader value proposition at this price point, which should appeal to quite a few people. The ANC is solid, the app is feature-packed, you can listen to your music over the wire if you drain the battery, and you have support for LDAC on board. </p><p>Sony packs a lot of punch into this booming set of headphones, making them a tough act to follow for the small pool of offerings at or around $200.</p>

<p>This week, Polar released a 22mm "Payment Wristband" with an NFC chip embedded into the strap, enabling tap-to-pay if your watch doesn&apos;t support it. We haven&apos;t seen tech-filled watch bands since the early days of Pebble and Galaxy Gear, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/en/media-room/polar-introduces-payment-wristbands-powered-by-fidesmo">Polar&apos;s modular tech</a> has me curious if this abandoned idea deserves a renaissance.</p><p>Smart straps died for several reasons. Put tech in a strap, and it naturally loses its flexibility, is more prone to failure, requires a power source, and is generally less comfortable. It also prevents users from swapping in their own straps since it means losing functionality.</p><p>Instead, with massive watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> on the rise, designers use lightweight bands as crutches to offset the extra weight. A thick, tech-filled band would be counterproductive. </p><p>With that context, it&apos;s hard to imagine why anyone would want "smart straps" to return. Still, handled correctly, smartwatch bands have untapped potential, and some companies have begun to explore that potential.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-ill-fated-history-of-apos-smart-apos-watch-bands-2">A brief, ill-fated history of &apos;smart&apos; watch bands</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7tiAXF6CZj9TkpcHsVxfsb" name="gear16_0.jpg" alt="A side view of the Samsung Galaxy Gear (2013)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tiAXF6CZj9TkpcHsVxfsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The original Galaxy Gear, with its visible camera bump. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original Samsung Galaxy Gear packed a 720p camera with autofocus, two mics, and a speaker into its band. Samsung&apos;s engineers saw that extra band space as an opportunity to keep the main watch more compact, instead of cramming everything into one space. </p><p>Our original reviewer called the 73g Gear "bulky and uncomfortable" and the strap&apos;s camera sensor a "wart." Samsung&apos;s engineers agreed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-2-gear-2-neo-and-gear-fit-review">Gear 2</a> moved the camera and mic/speaker tech onto the watch, and future iterations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-s2-review">Gear S2</a> had a much greater focus on style and comfort. From then on, you could swap any band onto a Gear or Galaxy watch without losing essential tech. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Companies have tried to put smart watch bands on watches before, but they never took off.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In that same early era, Pebble launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-time-review">Pebble Time</a>, its 2nd-gen watch, on Kickstarter with a unique "Smartstraps" gimmick. It featured a "smart accessory port" so third-party strap makers could pack tech and sensors into their straps that would sync directly with the watch. </p><p>Pebble offered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-announces-million-dollar-fund-bring-smartstrap-ideas-life">$1 million in funding</a> for Smartstrap devs, promising users add-ons like GPS, heart rate, or extended battery life. There was even an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/parag-smart-band-could-add-nfc-payments-pebble-time">NFC payment strap from Pagaré</a>. However, once Fitbit acquired the failing Pebble brand the following year, the concept died before it could truly begin. </p><p>These "optional" health and fitness add-ons became default features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> over time. Watch designers have become so efficient at squeezing useful components into a 13mm case that pushing tech into a thick band would unnecessarily complicate matters.</p>

<p>Sony took a different approach, selling standalone smart straps that you attach to non-smart luxury watches. Its 2015 Wena Wrist Pro tracked your steps, calories, and sleep. It even had a bizarre sliver of an OLED screen that displayed tiny contextual data along your wrist. However, its excessive price and limited features made it a novelty that never caught on.</p><p>It also sold a standalone fitness tracker with built-in GPS and HR data called the Wena Wrist Active. I mention it because Sony designed it with a unique connector that lets you mount any watch onto its front, adding classic style while keeping the health data.</p><p>Besides the 2013 Hands On Talk Watch, which had a mic and speaker embedded in the strap (thanks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>), I don&apos;t know of any other smartwatches with smart bands. The concept seemed to die off quickly, as most brands emulated Apple or Galaxy Watches in design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.03%;"><img id="aVQf63s2jy5LnHHjeeCQ6T" name="fitbit-pressure-sensoring-patent-figure-7.jpeg" alt="A Figure from the patent "Pressure sensor integration into wearable device" showing how a watch would tell you to adjust your fit for a proper Fit Score." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aVQf63s2jy5LnHHjeeCQ6T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2251" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: U.S. patent office; Fitbit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar&apos;s €59 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/payment-wristband-22mm" target="_blank">Payment Wristband</a> has one straightforward application: It is designed to make consumers pay for NFC themselves rather than add the tech to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a> or other watches. It&apos;s a niche tool, unlikely to achieve high sales, but still quite useful.</p><p>Are there other smartwatch "extras" that could fit inside a 20mm or 22mm watch band? It&apos;s complicated. </p><p>Ultramarathoners would love the original Pebble concept of a battery-enhancing, swap-on strap. Here&apos;s the problem: You&apos;d need an energy-receiving port in the strap connector — probably not Quick Release-compatible — and engineers would need to keep the band light and flexible despite how thick batteries typically are. Plus, encasing batteries in TPU material leaves them vulnerable to damage and failure.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t have a design or engineering background, but an add-on strap with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">Ultra Wideband</a> seems more feasible. UWB lets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> owners pinpoint their lost Apple Watch or use their watch as a digital car key; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-plans-to-give-watch-unlock-a-boost-with-ultra-wideband-tech">next Pixel Watch could add UWB </a>as well. But an UWB strap, like an NFC strap, could theoretically work as a standalone add-on for any watch.</p><p>Straying freely into wish-fulfillment territory, I suspect most Garmin watch fans would love a strap that added LTE compatibility. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a>, they&apos;ve waited in vain for more cellular options that would make Garmin watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-smartwatches-have-emergency-sos-fall-detection">more useful in emergencies</a>. </p><p>Like a battery strap, though, an LTE strap would be difficult to implement. Despite how small a 5G chip is, a standalone receiver with the necessary power source would be the <em>opposite</em> of portable. You&apos;d need a physical connection through the strap to the main CPU, and I just don&apos;t know if that would work. </p><p>For any other potential watch add-on, the engineering challenge alone makes it more likely that smartwatch brands would simply...put the tech in the watch. For example, you might assume a band could track an athlete&apos;s sweat loss, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-patented-perspiration-sensor-for-tracking-sweat-loss">this Apple patent</a> shows how a watch would track that data directly from the main body.</p>

<p>Currently, the only practical application I know of for a dynamic watch strap is found on portable blood pressure watches. Several models have <em>inflatable</em> straps that expand during BP readings for more accurate results, in theory. I couldn&apos;t tell you if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>&apos;s BP readings are more or less accurate with a normal watch band.</p><p>The next frontier is all about neural interface bands. Think of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-apple-watch-double-tap-on-galaxy-watch-6">Double Tap feature</a> made popular with the Apple Watch, only with much better accuracy because these bands can read the signals from your brain, knowing that you intend to make a pinching motion even if your fingers barely move. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mudra-band.com/" target="_blank">Mudra Band</a>, released this year, replaces your typical watch strap and becomes a neural controller for any Apple computer, TV, Vision Pro, or other devices. Tech nerds could get a lot out of this, though it costs nearly as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Series 9</a> itself. </p><p>Meanwhile, Meta is making its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-says-neural-interface-controls-are-close-to-ready">own neural EMG band</a>, promising mid-air typing to chat with an AI. CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims the "neural interface continuously gets better over time at understanding each person" and says it&apos;ll be product-ready in a couple of years. I&apos;d have to assume it&apos;ll be pricey, as well. </p><p>Perhaps that&apos;s the future of smartwatch strap tech that we should expect: expensive, niche, a bit gimmicky, and with cool implications. More straightforward smart straps with feature additions or battery enhancements sound pretty neat in theory, but a bit too impractical and costly to the consumer for companies to invest in the idea. </p>

The impressive AI capabilities of the Galaxy S24 series have significantly boosted trust in Exynos processors.</p><p>In early May, Samsung and Synopsys <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.synopsys.com/2024-05-02-Synopsys-and-Samsung-Electronics-Collaborate-to-Achieve-First-Production-Tapeout-of-Flagship-Mobile-CPU-with-Leading-Performance-on-Samsung-Foundrys-GAA-Process" target="_blank">announced</a> in a joint press release that they had successfully mass-produced a prototype 3nm process design. While not explicitly mentioned, it&apos;s widely believed that this 3nm process will be used for the Exynos 2500.</p><p>Although Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 series remains the frontrunner in both performance and energy efficiency, Exynos chips are narrowing the gap, offering a compelling, cost-effective alternative to Qualcomm’s options.</p><p>The enhanced efficiency of the Exynos 2500 chipset is likely tied to its manufacturing technique, which minimizes energy leakage and boosts drive current in the chips. Reduced energy leakage offers clear advantages, while increased drive current affects the power flowing through the chip&apos;s components, enhancing both their speed and overall performance.</p><p>Apart from the Galaxy S23 series, which featured Snapdragon chips across the board, the Snapdragon-equipped versions of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S phones sold in the US have typically surpassed other versions in efficiency.</p><p>This year, the Galaxy S24 models with the Exynos 2400 chip nearly matched their Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 counterparts. However, consumers in Europe and several other regions still found themselves with devices that were not quite on par with those available in the US.</p><p>However, a significant efficiency boost in the new Exynos could give global users an advantage over US models, despite the performance gap with Snapdragon.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need something you can trust to stay alive for days on end outside, with solar charging that can offer a potentially unlimited battery life; you want a smartwatch with extreme GPS accuracy, suitable for outdoor activities like backpacking, hiking, camping, and more; having a built-in LED flashlight is a major selling point for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer a slim, lightweight smartwatch; having a super-high-resolution watch display is important to you.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the solar charging capabilities on the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar make it our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">favorite Garmin smartwatch for battery life</a>. Depending on how you use it, you can get up to 145 hours of battery life with solar charging when only using GPS. However, with the watch&apos;s Expedition GPS Activity mode, the company says you can get unlimited battery life with solar, so there&apos;s that.</p><p>This is one of, if not the, largest smartwatch Android Central has tested, so it might not be the best option for those who need something really lightweight. It also doesn&apos;t offer the best-looking smartwatch display out there.</p><p>However, the Instinct 2X Solar makes up for much of what it lacks in screen aesthetics and size with its features and durability. At this price, it seems like a pretty solid smartwatch option for those who love the outdoors—especially with summer right around the corner.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google I/O 2024 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-keynote-made-cool-ai-features-look-boring">the most developer-focused developer conference</a> we&apos;ve seen in quite a while, and it was full of AI talk. The phrase was mentioned in some form or another more than 120 times, in fact. For consumers, most of the AI features mentioned won&apos;t have a tangible impact on the way they use technology. That&apos;s with the notable exception of one feature — AI scam call detection — that could become the most important Android feature added to the platform in years. </p><p>Google is testing scam detection alerts. Although the company shared a preview of the feature in action at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2024">Google I/O</a>, we don&apos;t have a release date or many details at the moment. Google promised to share more details "later this year," and that&apos;s the best timeline we have. Still, the idea behind the feature is a great one, and it looks impressive in demos. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're testing a new feature that uses Gemini Nano to provide real-time alerts during a call if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams. This protection all happens on-device so your conversation stays private to you. More to come later this year! #GoogleIO pic.twitter.com/l87wGCz62x<a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1790449419684573288">May 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The proposition is simple: AI will help unknowing users avoid falling victim to a cell phone scam. It uses on-device AI to detect words and phrases commonly associated with phishing scams and alert the user that the call they&apos;re receiving is likely a scam. For example, in the demo video, Google showed off a scam detection alert that appeared after a so-called "bank representative" asked a user to transfer funds to a new account. </p><p>Essentially, the AI model would be trained to figure out what kinds of requests have a tendency to be fraudulent. The most common type of phishing scams today involve scammers asking people to pay them through gift cards. As such, AI scam call detection could inform a user that a scam is likely once the caller asks them to send gift card redemption codes. </p><p>Surprisingly, the feedback coming from users on social media about AI scam detection hasn&apos;t been overwhelmingly positive. However, this feature has the potential to do the most good of anything announced at Google I/O, and here&apos;s why. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G6sYDy7nJGY5qbZ43aGV9G" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-call-screening-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro call screening" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G6sYDy7nJGY5qbZ43aGV9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let&apos;s address the obvious question: do we really need AI to tell us that we shouldn&apos;t transfer our life savings based on one unsolicited phone call? It might be hard to believe, but the answer is yes. Chances are, if you&apos;re reading Android Central, you probably have a higher understanding of tech literacy and internet safety than the average person. Technology enthusiasts can spot scams instantly, and most of us know better than to even pick up the phone when we don&apos;t know the number and aren&apos;t expecting a call. </p><p>Not everyone is well-versed enough in technology to spot scams quickly and effectively. Older people often fall victim to these types of scams more often than anyone. We can all probably think of someone in our lives who might be fooled by a scam phone call, especially as scammers evolve and find new ways to try to trick people. </p><p>If you still aren&apos;t convinced spam calls are a massive problem in 2024, here are some numbers to back it up. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/#scam-detection" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing this feature, Google referenced a study from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newswire.com/news/global-losses-to-scammers-exceed-1-trillion-as-1-in-4-lose-money-to-22145725" target="_blank">Global Anti-Scam Alliance</a>. It found that just in 2023, people around the world lost an estimated $1.026 trillion to scams and identity theft. The report included 49,459 people from 43 countries and shows just how prevalent scams are. </p><p>Though these are estimated figures, we have more concrete data in the U.S. The FBI releases an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank">Internet Crime Report</a> each year chronicling the reports of online theft and scams and the amount of money that was stolen. In 2023, there was a whopping $12.5 billion lost due to digital scams in the U.S. That&apos;s up from $10.3 billion in 2022 and $6.9 billion in 2021. The number of online scams and the amount of money lost are both sharply increasing. For reference, only $3.5 billion was lost in 2019 — so the amount of money lost has tripled in a five-year period. </p><p>There are all different kinds of online scams and identity thefts that contribute to the Internet Crime Report. However, the largest number of complaints reported to the FBI came from phishing scams. In 2023, there were 298,878 reports of phishing scams in the U.S., and that&apos;s more than all the reports from the other four categories combined. </p><p>For those unfamiliar, scams using the phishing method try to trick users into willfully giving up information or money. When someone calls you pretending to be a bank or the IRS, for example, they are attempting to phish your credentials or cash. These are precisely the types of scams that Google&apos;s scam detection feature could thwart using AI.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s feature works by analyzing your calls in real-time and matching words and phrases with those commonly used in scams. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-must-balance-ai-features-with-privacy">Sounds like a privacy nightmare</a>, right? Actually, it isn&apos;t because Google is using on-device processing for the whole thing. For years, companies have used on-device processing to keep certain sensitive types of information from leaving your device. Google has the Titan M2 security chip, and Apple has the Secure Enclave. </p><p>In this case, Google is using the Gemini Nano model to detect potential scams in your calls. That means Google won&apos;t be able to listen to your calls or even collect any data from them. It&apos;ll all happen on your phone, using Google&apos;s smallest AI model, without any information being sent down to the company. </p><p>This does come with its downsides, like phone compatibility. Since it uses Gemini Nano, the scam call detection feature would likely only be compatible with certain phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> if it launched today. Gemini Nano is said to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">coming to the Pixel 8</a> later on and could be coming to more phones in the future. But for the sake of privacy, only devices capable of running Gemini Nano will be able to make use of this functionality. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve long said that AI will be far more beneficial to the casual, uninformed tech users than the enthusiasts — especially in the beginning. A perfect example of this concept is Google&apos;s plan for AI scam detection alerts. They might not help you or me, but they will help tons of people avoid scam attempts before they are put in an awful situation. </p><p>These are the kinds of features that can be the difference between a life-altering mistake being made and a crisis being easily avoided. That&apos;s why, throughout all the AI nonsense Google went on about at I/O, these scam detection alerts are what I&apos;m most looking forward to seeing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. </p>
