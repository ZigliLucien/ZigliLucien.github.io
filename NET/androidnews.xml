                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New information reveals what to expect from the Pixel 9 handsets.</li><li>The company will likely offer a Google One AI Premium plan for Pixel 9 owners who purchase the device before October 31, 2025.</li><li>The offers also include six months of Fitbit Premium subscription and three months of YouTube Premium.</li></ul>
<p>Google is gearing up to launch the Pixel 9 series next week on August 13. Thanks to countless leaks, we have seen a lot of what&apos;s coming.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-bonuses-freebies">Android Headlines</a>, some leaked material hints that Pixel 9 Pro Fold buyers will get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a> for free with every purchase of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. Besides, they would also get six months of Fitbit Premium subscription in addition to three months of YouTube Premium subscription.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.39%;"><img id="nc8Cxg6uTg7r25mSeecz2c" name="Google-Pixel-9-pro-promo-leak.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Promo leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nc8Cxg6uTg7r25mSeecz2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1064" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that these freebies are not just for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> but also for the other products in the line-up, like the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the newbie Pixel 9 Pro XL. Yes, provided that they purchase any of these products before October 31, 2025, which is probably up until the next Pixel series launch next year. This means that any users purchasing any Pixel 9 product over the course of the next year can take advantage of these freebies.</p><p>Another leak from last week revealed the pricing and specs of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series and shared the launch offers. The details shared then were more or less the same, per the publication. Since the emphasis is naturally on AI, the Google One AI Premium plan is a good choice that the company wants to offer to Pixel 9 series buyers.</p>
<p>They not only get access to Gemini&apos;s Advanced feature but also benefit from 2TB of Google One storage. The bundled offer is usually charged $19.99 per month if bought separately. Google also offered many freebies with a purchase of the Pixel 8 last year but this Gemini Advanced offer would be something new.</p><p>The company offered a six-month trial of the Google One Premium 2TB plan for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and Pixel 8 Pro buyers, and the offer persists until December 31, 2024. Similarly, the more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> offers a three-month trial of the Google One Premium 100 GB plan, which ends next year on December 31, 2025.</p><p>These offers truly sound interesting for potential buyers of the Pixel 9 series after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">launch event</a>. It will be encouraging to see what else Google has in its store next week.</p>

<ul><li>A photo of Huawei's former CEO, Richard Yu, has started circulating social media because it seems he's holding a tri-folding phone.</li><li>A Weibo tipster stated the device is similar to a prototype they've seen with a 10-inch inner display alongside speculation that it could launch before Q4 2024.</li><li>An early report claimed that Huawei started "mass-producing" a tri-fold phone in February and that it would feature a display similar to the running theory.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The foldable world could be in for a shake-up as a photo suggests Huawei&apos;s tri-fold device is very real.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/09/huaweis-tri-foldable-phone-spotted-in-real-launching-soon/">Gizmochina</a>, a photo of Huawei&apos;s former CEO Richard Yu preparing for a flight shows him supposedly holding a tri-fold phone. Enhancing the image offers a vague look at where the device might bend (or fold) to open/close. Additionally, it looks like the far left of the device is slightly bent, potentially indicating the first hinge&apos;s placement.</p><p>Chiming in is Chinese Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/Orr2aF2z9?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), who claims that the device in question is the real deal. They claim the photographed device is similar to a previously witnessed prototype with a double hinge design. More importantly, the device is rumored to feature a 10-inch inner display when open.</p><p>A punch-hole selfie camera is speculated for the "far left" of the internal display. A specification rumor states the tri-fold phone will contain HiSilicon&apos;s Kirin 9 series SoC. Additionally, DCS suggests this tri-fold device will debut "earlier than the Huawei Mate 70."</p><p>The publication states that the Mate 70 isn&apos;t expected to hit the shelves until Q4 2024, which <em>could </em>mean we&apos;re closer to the world&apos;s first tri-folding device than we realize. Take this with a grain of salt, but speculation states we could see anywhere from now until September.</p>

<p>Huawei&apos;s tri-folding phone is expected to debut with a "premium" price tag. Users on Weibo have also started wondering if the company will include a stylus due to its size.</p><p>The idea of a "tri-fold" phone piqued consumer interest reports claimed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-huawei-new-foldable-phone-push">Huawei started developing such a device</a> earlier this year. That post stated the Chinese company started "mass-producing" a device that would fold twice to form a "Z" shape. Similarly, early rumors claimed the device would offer a 10-inch internal display, which continues to be the running theory.</p><p>Unfortunately, the device never arrived during the first half of the year as the report claimed. So, we&apos;ll have to see if this next rumored timeframe pans out.</p><p>The other side of that report dealt with Samsung who were supposedly putting the "rollable" phone idea back on the table. The Korean OEM did show off a prototype of a rolling phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">during CES 2024</a>, so maybe that theory holds water.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When Google took the wraps off of the latest iteration of the Nest Learning Thermostat, there was something very familiar about it. After a few minutes of pondering, I finally figured it out — it&apos;s a blown-up Pixel Watch on the wall. Well, it&apos;s missing the crown, but instead, it adopts a rotating dial around the display, something the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch</a> team could adopt from the Nest team.</p><p>Based on the leaks, Google is already aiming to solve one of my complaints about the Pixel Watch, as we&apos;re now hopefully going to see a larger model released. Now, I&apos;m hoping Google will adopt this Nest Thermostat design feature to future Pixel Watch models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uxuyBUSfwF6bNdVougL4km" name="nest-learning-thermostat-4th-gen-changing-temp-promo.jpg" alt="Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) changing temperature lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxuyBUSfwF6bNdVougL4km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m no engineer, so I don&apos;t know if it would actually be feasible, but I would love to see a Pixel Watch with the ability to navigate the menus by swiping your finger around the outer casing.</p><p>This is basically the premise of navigating menus or adjusting the temperature on the thermostat. After spending a few minutes playing around with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">4th Gen Nest Thermostat</a>, this kind of interaction makes much more sense than smudging up the screen. I can&apos;t help but wonder why Google hasn&apos;t done this with the Watch, especially when it&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s a bit of "one hand washes the other" going on internally. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I&apos;d love it if we saw some type of physical rotating bezel akin to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, but that&apos;s unlikely. I can&apos;t imagine Google making a watch large or bulky enough for something like that to even be implemented.</p><p>Speaking of Samsung, it has used a touch-sensitive bezel in different Galaxy Watch models over the years. We&apos;ve also seen physical rotating bezels on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review">Galaxy Watch 3 Classic</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Watch 4 Classic</a>, and Watch 6 Classic. Rather disappointingly, Samsung opted against bringing it back with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. </p>

<p>Admittedly, I&apos;ve found that the touch bezel solution is <em>very</em> hit or miss, seemingly only working when it wants to. But since there isn&apos;t a digital crown on any Galaxy Watch besides the Ultra, the only other way to interact with your watch is to swipe up, down, and around on the screen. </p><p>It&apos;s really not <em>that</em> big of a deal unless you&apos;re someone like me who has sausage links for fingers. My fat fingers get in the way of being able to see everything, and it&apos;s frankly just a frustrating experience, especially when dealing with such small crowns like the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>Perhaps that&apos;s the reason why we have yet to see anything like what the Nest Thermostat offers being integrated into Google&apos;s wearable. Samsung and Google have supposedly been working closely together on the platform ever since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-wear-os-google-smartwatch">partnership</a> was announced alongside Wear OS 3. Because of that, I can only assume that Google has some kind of idea about the benefits and pain points of the touch bezel.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not expecting anything drastically different from the Pixel Watch 3 series. Hell, I&apos;m just happy that all signs point to Google releasing a larger version, almost as excited as I am about a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel Fold</a> (odd name notwithstanding). </p><p>I also don&apos;t want to go so far as to presume that this is something that Google has in the cards for a future Pixel Watch model. Who&apos;s to say that the company "gives up the hardware goose" after this year and just lets Samsung become the only real choice if you want an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>? It&apos;s not outside the realm of possibility, especially if Google ends up needing to find more projects to send to the graveyard.</p>

<p>No matter what, seeing the similarities between the 4th Gen Nest Thermostat and Pixel Watch has me a little excited. Instead of "the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing," it <em>feels</em> like there&apos;s some cross-pollination happening. If you need any additional evidence of this, just check out the design of the different screens on the Thermostat. You can&apos;t tell me that they don&apos;t look like Pixel Watch faces. </p><p>Hopefully, this will become a trend with Google devices, as long as it makes sense and is not done just for the sake of it. </p>

<ul><li>Google started rolling out version 7.0 of the Authenticator app, which overhauls its UI to fit its Material 3 design.</li><li>The redesign adds two new features: Privacy Screen and a search option for app security and convenience.</li><li>Google shifted to storing your one-time codes within your account instead of your device last year as it pushes toward a "passwordless" world.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Authenticator, the helpful one-stop shop for your two-factor passwords, just picked up a big redesign with new features, seemingly rolling out soon for all users.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/08/google-authenticator-material-you-redesign/">9to5Google</a> quickly spotted the redesign (v7.0) rolling out on Android, which brings the app up to Material 3 code. Because the Authenticator app holds the (literal) key to our accounts, Google has rolled out a new "Privacy Screen" feature. The company intends to bolster the app&apos;s security with this feature by restricting access using your lock screen credentials.</p><p>Activated within the app&apos;s settings, users can enable Privacy Screen which will use your previously set PIN or biometric as its own. Users can then set how quickly the Authenticator app requires another password entry.</p><p>The app offers the following options: immediately, after 10 seconds, after one minute, and after 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The second addition involves the ability for Android users to search for content between Google accounts. Moreover, the publication states the app has now integrated the hamburger menu icon with the account switcher.</p><p>Some smaller changes join the update via the QR code scanning viewfinder. Google added some privacy information, stating the image captured isn&apos;t shared, only the "scan results." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-visual-search-ui-grid-view">Unlike Lens</a>, Google doesn&apos;t keep the image you&apos;ve snapped stored anywhere (or for any purpose). The QR code scanner also adds a flash option at the top right corner for illuminating darker codes.</p><p>Several screens and the accompanying UI across the Authenticator app have been overhauled to fit Google&apos;s Material design. The post states that version 7.0 of the app hasn&apos;t become available for most Android devices. When it does, users can download it via the Play Store.</p><p>Google&apos;s work with the Authenticator app has been kept relatively quiet other than the app&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-authenticator-account-sync">one-time code sync for accounts</a>. The feature aimed to solve user frustration behind losing their device or having it stolen. Google moved the codes used for 2FA (two-factor authentication) to your account instead of storing them natively within the device.</p><p>If users don&apos;t like that idea, they can always disable the sync option or not sign into a Google account. This is all part of Google&apos;s efforts to create a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fido-passwordless-security">passwordless</a>" world as it introduces new options like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-account-passkey-access-by-default">passkeys for accounts</a>.</p>

<p>Google is making some interesting changes to the Pixel series this year. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> will not only feature a brand-new design, evolved from the current design, but it will apparently come in three variants, marking the return of the XL model. There have long been rumors that Google will give us a Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and it seems the rumors are likely true.</p><p>Google itself has already begun teasing its devices, revealing the design of the Pixel 9 Pro. The device will have a very flat frame, a flat back panel, and a free-floating camera visor that protrudes from the back and is no longer attached to the frame. It also appears that the corners will be fairly rounded, and the phone will retain a triple camera setup with the temperature sensor on the rear.</p><p>In the teaser below, the phone also appears in what looks like a Porcelain colorway.</p>

<p>Based on leaks and rumors, the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro will be roughly the same size, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review">featuring 6.3-inch displays</a>, with the main visual difference being the lack of a third camera lens on the Pixel 9. Meanwhile, the rumored Pixel 9 Pro XL will apparently feature a larger 6.8-inch display, giving you two sizes of Pro phone to choose from.</p><p>All phones are set to be powered by the Tensor G4, which is rumored to offer a mild performance boost over the Pixel 8 series. We also expect to see 50MP primary cameras across the board, with a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP telephoto for the Pro phones.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> is going through a bit of identity crisis, as the successor is switching up its naming and instead going with something a bit longer: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. It&apos;s a bit of a mouthful compared to "Pixel Fold 2" but it will seemingly bring the device closer to its Pixel 9 siblings in name, while the device also adopts a design closer to the other phones.</p><p>We&apos;ve already seen plenty of leaks showing off the design of the phone, but Google has also teased the device, giving us a good look at the new rectangular camera housing. The phone has a flat frame and what appears to be a wider body with more expansive internal display. Official teasers haven&apos;t yet shown the outer display, but rumors suggest it will be identical to the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro at 6.3-inches, while the internal display will measure eight inches.</p>

<p>Like the other phones, it will likely be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">Tensor G4</a> chipset and come with 16GB of RAM, although it could feature a smaller battery than its predecessor.</p><p>The cameras may be downgraded compared to the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The primary camera is rumored to be a 48MP unit, with two 10.8MP sensors for the ultrawide and telephoto cameras. We&apos;re also expecting 10MP sensors for the inner and external selfie cameras.</p>

<p>While Google has yet to officially tease its next Pixel Watch, we've seen plenty of leaks that tell us what we need to know. It seems that this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> may finally be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-leaks-again-in-promo-video">offered in two sizes</a>, which should accommodate people with larger or smaller wrists. Not only are the sizes increasing, but so is the display, with the bezel shrinking as a result. The smaller watch may sport the same 1.2-inch panel, while the 45mm variant may come with a 1.4-inch display, both with up to 2,000 nits of brightness.</p><p>As for the chipset, it's rumored Google is sticking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a>, which proved to be quite performant on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. The downside, however, is that there won't seem to be much in the way of battery gains, with leaks suggesting we'll see 36 hours per charge when used in Battery Save mode.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Pixel Watch 3 may gain some new fitness features, with an increased focus on running, as well as other capabilities such as a live view of Nest Doorbell feeds.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-2">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</h2>

<p>Google may finally grace us with a new flagship pair of Pixel Buds this year, which could come with a new design. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaked-ad-design">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> were recently leaked, showing off the case, which looks more or less the same as before. However, the buds may be offered in some fun new colors, including Raspberry, Porcelain, Haze, and Mojito.</p><p>It's also rumored that these may be the first earbuds to feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-gemini-capabilities-spotted">Gemini compatibility</a>, which would let you talk to the new chat assistant straight without taking out your phone. This would be quite an interesting step as Google is seemingly working to replace Google Assistant, and it could be the first of many Gemini-compatible earbuds.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that AI will have a big presence at the Made by Google event, as it will be injected into just about everything that gets launched. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-new-google-ai-features-claims">According to a leak</a>, the Pixel 9 series is set to gain some interesting Google AI features, including Add Me, Studio, and Pixel screenshots. The first appears to be able to capture a group of people in a single shot, which may include someone not in the photo, like whoever&apos;s taking the picture.</p><p>Studio appears to be some type of image generator, while Pixel screenshots may be some new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-recall-faq-everything-you-need-to-know">Recall</a>-like feature that will be the new home for your screenshots, allowing the phone to analyze and remember information stored on the images to bring up later.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:160.42%;"><img id="ToduuzxfpBG9SLSbhuZYHV" name="google-pixel-9-google-ai-rumored-overview.jpg" alt="Sources claim the Pixel 9 will receive "Google AI," a collection of AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToduuzxfpBG9SLSbhuZYHV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="384" height="616" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what new capabilities Google intends to surprise us with, as the rumored features sound quite interesting already. Of course, we'll learn more about what these new Pixel devices can do at the event.</p>

<p>One thing that we may or may not get at the Pixel 9 Made by Google event is Android 15. The beta is already on its last legs, having reached <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-3-platform-stability-rollout">platform stability</a> in June. It seems like a matter of time until we get the stable version of the software, but it remains unclear if that&apos;ll be the case, with rumors swirling that the Pixel 9 series may launch with Android 14.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is expected to arrive on the Pixel Watch 3, and Google has already teased new capabilities and battery-saving features for the update. Samsung smartwatches have had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">access to the beta</a> for some time, with the company&apos;s One UI Watch flavor sitting on top. Hopefully, Pixel Watch users won&apos;t have to wait much longer to update their devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google was spotted testing a new build of Wear OS that supposedly runs off the next major Android version.</p><p>The existence of a test build was reported to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-5-1-android-15-3469455/">Android Authority</a> by a rumored "insider," stating Google has started developing a Wear OS 5.1 update. It was stated that the new build swapped out its initial lettering, opting for "AP4A" instead of Wear OS 5&apos;s "AW2A" number.</p><p>This new Wear OS 5.1 build is reportedly based on Android 15, a theory seemingly bolstered by the shift in build ID number. Wear OS 5, by comparison, is still on Android 14.</p><p>More importantly, the unknown insider said that Google was testing the upcoming software on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> internally. The company&apos;s Wear OS software has always lagged behind the <em>current </em>Android software — and was never so consistent. Wear OS 4 debuted in August 2023 and with Wear OS 5 arriving first on the Galaxy Watch 7, it seems that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Google hit its stride</a>.</p><p>With that in mind, there&apos;s uncertainty about whether or not Google will keep the update as "Wear OS 5.1" or if it&apos;s just testing Wear OS 6 early. Mishaal Rahman writing for the publication states that the specifics of the 5.1 update are unknown. However, if Google were to update its "APIs or app-facing system behaviors," that could warrant a major number increase.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve got a toss-up regarding when Google could launch the Pixel Watch 3 as it has yet to tease it. The company is gearing up for an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event on August 13</a>, so we&apos;ll see when the device will launch. Google&apos;s Pixel Watch 3 is expected to arrive sporting Wear OS 5, which was said to come "later this year" during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5">developer preview</a> in May.</p><p>While we await the "stock" version of Wear OS 5, Google previously clued us into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">a few of its key upgrades</a>. When running default settings, Google stated the software will utilize 20% less power when compared to last year&apos;s version.</p><p>Additionally, Android Health will deliver improved running data and goals alongside Health Connect upgrades. Another critical aspect of the base Wear OS 5 software is that it runs off last year&apos;s Android 14. With Google seemingly more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">committed to annual Wear OS release cycles</a>, perhaps this 5.1 update is a testament to that. We&apos;re still waiting for the stable launch of Android 15, so maybe the company&apos;s looking to sync up these launches.</p>

Bundle the purchase of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 (or the Z Fold 6) with any six-month data plan at Mint, and the T-Mobile-owned MVNO carrier will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6/6473480/"><strong>hook you up with a $100 discount AND six additional months of wireless service</strong></a> for free. </p>

<p>Just in time for back-to-school season, pick up a new Samsung foldable alongside ANY six-month data plan at Mint Mobile and you'll score a straight $100 off the phone plus six extra months of wireless service for free. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is a cutting-edge clamshell device with a durable folding hinge, super-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 performance, and seven years of software support straight out of the box. We've already seen quite a few <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-deals">Z Flip 6 deals</a>, but this is the first time Mint has gotten involved. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6/6473480/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="007612a3-aa31-4506-a5df-cc5f5b078e65" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,100" data-dimension48="$1,100">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Just like the Z Flip 6, if you pair the purchase of the premium Z Fold 6 with any six-month data plan at Mint Mobile, you'll get a $100 discount alongside six free months of coverage. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is like a premium smartphone and tablet all rolled into one, coming complete with a nearly-invisible center crease, a ton of AI features, and top-of-the-line Snapdragon performance. It's also very expensive, which is why <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-deals">Galaxy Z Fold 6 deals</a> should be taken seriously.  <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6/6473054/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="76e5e228-460a-448f-8803-28a722f98e08" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB: $1,900" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB: $1,900">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re sick of paying phone bills every month; you want to use one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in the industry; you have good T-Mobile coverage in your area. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you don&apos;t want to be stuck with a single wireless carrier for a year; you&apos;re already locked into a contract; you can find a good trade-in deal elsewhere. </p><p>If you&apos;re not totally sold on this Mint Mobile deal just yet, let me break it down so you see why it stands out from other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-mvno-deals-of-month-year-is-it-time-to-switch">MVNO promotions</a>. For starters, it&apos;s important to note that Mint Mobile operates with a "buy in bulk" plan system. Customers pay for their wireless service in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time, picking from four simple data plans powered by T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network. Once their time allotment has reached an end, customers have the option to purchase another data plan or cancel their account without penalty. </p><p>The nice thing about this system is that you can simply pay for a year of wireless in advance and not have to worry about another phone bill for the next 12 months. For example, even if you signed up for six months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>&apos;s <em>most expensive </em>Unlimited data plan and bought the Galaxy Z Flip 6, you&apos;d make a single payment of $1,180 (or $50 per month with affirm) and be hooked up with a great 2024 device AND an entire year of wireless service. No more phone bills, no confusing eligibility requirements, and once the year is over you&apos;re free to switch carriers again or update your plan with zero hassle. </p><p>It&apos;s basically the perfect deal for anyone who wants to pair an innovative new phone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> in the business, as long as you don&apos;t mind being stuck with a single carrier for a year. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s updated weather app, set to launch soon on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series, is already available for early testing ahead of the tech giant&apos;s big event on August 13.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-weather-app-sideload-apk-available-3469072/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, you can now manually install the beta version of Google’s updated Weather app through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/weather-14/weather-14-1-0-20240318-637962058-release/weather-1-0-20240318-637962058-android-apk-download/" target="_blank">APKMirror</a>. It works on devices running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> or later, but expect some glitches since it’s still in development.</p><p>Google is about to roll out a new, feature-packed Weather app as a standard part of the Pixel 9. What started as a feature in the Clock app will soon become its own standalone app. However, it might end up being a Pixel-exclusive when it officially launches.</p><p>The app features a sleek, rounded design for a fresh look, but the weather data it provides is pretty much the same as what you’ve seen in previous widgets.</p><p>Leaked screenshots show the new Weather app has a clean, user-friendly design with easy access to hourly and 10-day forecasts. It also highlights wind speed, visibility, air pressure, and humidity. Plus, you can customize most tiles, though the 10-day forecast tile stays put, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/07/pixel-weather-leak-install/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the new Weather app is easy to use without needing a Google account. But if you want to sync your saved locations across devices, logging in with a Google account is the way to go.</p><p>Keep in mind that this early version of the app might miss some features planned for the final release. Leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1821418757685686710" target="_blank">AssembleDebug</a> suggests that AI-driven weather summaries and detailed maps could be part of the full version. Given Google’s recent focus on AI, it’s likely these advanced features will be included.</p><p>Sideloading means installing apps from outside the Google Play Store, skipping Google’s security checks, so be very cautious: only use apps from trusted sources and be aware of the risks involved.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 kept the same design as last year (only slightly thicker) and shed the classy Classic upgrade option, which you may not like. But the Watch 7's revamped BioSensor will make the watch more useful for health monitoring, the new Exynos chip loads apps faster, and LTE fans will appreciate the doubled storage for better on-wrist music playlists.</p></p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 and 7 could be twins, at least on the surface. If you were hoping the Watch 7 would make changes to things like the display, battery capacity, or overall <em>look</em> — or if you have the Watch 6 Classic and love your rotating bezel — then you may want to stick with your Watch 6 for now, as it's still an excellent smartwatch.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 follows a similar template to the Galaxy Watch 6. Most Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Galaxy Watch 6 upgrades can be found in its performance, storage, and health/fitness tracking.</p><p>Changes to the colors and bands aside, you&apos;d have a lot of trouble telling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch 6</a> apart; they have the same display sizes, protection, digital bezel, and overall look, with their weights differing by less than a gram.</p><p>Below, we&apos;ll compare the Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Watch 6 to help you decide whether to trade in your Watch 6 for the Watch 7 or to hold out for the Galaxy Watch 8. Even though the Galaxy Watch 7 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> available today, you may not find enough major differences to justify an upgrade.</p>

<p>If you own the Galaxy Watch 6, these aspects of your current watch will remain unchanged with the Galaxy Watch 7:</p><p><strong>Displays:</strong> Both watches ship in 40mm and 44mm case sizes, with matching 1.3-inch and 1.5-inch displays. They have the same resolution (432x432 or 480x480, based on the size) and the same 2,000 nits of brightness, which is fairly standard for flagship watches and is only beaten by the 3,000-nit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</p><p>Plus, both rely on a digital touch bezel, letting you scroll your finger along the display edge to slide down menus or across Tiles. We&apos;re ignoring the Watch 6 Classic and its physical bezel for this comparison. </p><p><strong>Memory</strong>: Both watches have 2GB of RAM, the current max we&apos;ve seen in smartwatches.</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: Technically, the Watch 7 40mm and 44mm weigh 0.1g and 0.5g more than their Watch 6 counterparts, but your wrist could never tell the difference. It&apos;s the same physical profile.</p><p><strong>Protection: </strong>Both watches have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">maximum ingress protection</a> for dust and water resistance, specifically lasting for up to 30 minutes in 1.5 meters of water or 10 minutes in 50 meters of depth.</p><p>They also have equal sapphire display scratch protection. Samsung claims they both passed MIL-STD-810H tests for high/low temperature, altitude, humidity, immersion, salt, fog, dust, vibration, and drops.</p>

<p><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> While the Galaxy Watch 7 might last longer than the Watch 6 (more on that below), the actual capacity remains unchanged for both sizes. The 44mm Watch 7 and 6 have 125mAh extra capacity, but the larger display mostly cancels this out.</p><p><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Either watch provides the same efficient Bluetooth 5.3 standard, NFC payments via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Google Wallet or Samsung Wallet</a>, WiFi 2.4 and 5 GHz, and LTE connectivity. For the latter, you have to pay for the cellular Watch 6 or 7 upfront for $50 extra, then add it to your cellular plan.</p><p><strong>Software:</strong> As of early August, the Galaxy Watch 6 hasn&apos;t updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, but that should change soon after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> launch, according to rumors. From that point onwards, the Watch 7 and 6 will have the same software and security updates until mid-2027, when the Watch 6 runs out of support. That means another three years of comparable software perks, if you don&apos;t upgrade.</p><p><strong>Sensors:</strong> While the Watch 7 did get an important sensor upgrade, what it tracks is mostly unchanged from past generations: resting and current heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), passive atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection, active AFib detection (ECG), skin temperature, blood oxygen (SpO2), nighttime breathing rate, and menstrual cycles.</p><p>You also get the same accelerometer and gyroscope for workout tracking, barometer for elevation data, geomagnetic sensor for navigation, and ambient light sensor to auto-adjust the display to your surroundings. </p>

<p>Why upgrade from the Galaxy Watch 6 to the Galaxy Watch 7? Here are the main differences, based on differences between our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7 review test</a> and our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 review</a> (and my subsequent months using the last-gen watch):</p><p><strong>Better heart rate accuracy:</strong> The Galaxy Watch 7 has 13 heart rate sensor LEDs to the Watch 6&apos;s four LEDs. Where the Watch 6 had green, red, and IR sensors, the Watch 7 adds new colors — Blue, Yellow, Violet and Ultraviolet — while needing fewer photodiodes to power them all.</p><p>Samsung claims that the Watch 7&apos;s "optimal allocation" of green, red, and IR LEDs "more accurately measures health metrics such as heart rate, sleep quality, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and stress levels" than the Watch 6. In particular, it&apos;s supposed to be 30% more accurate during high-intensity workouts.</p><p>I performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a> — the Ultra and Watch 7 share sensors — and it did very well for heart rate accuracy, though it still struggled a bit to track heart rates in the 170+ bpm range. Still, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-fitness-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 6 fitness test</a> gave me less accurate results, so athletes will be happy with this change.</p><p><strong>More accurate dual-band GPS:</strong> The Galaxy Watch 7 is the first Samsung watch to have dual-band GPS, which tracks you from multiple satellite types (older L1s and newer L5s) to circumvent signal blockage or reflections off of buildings, mountains, tree cover, and so on.</p><p>Again, the Watch Ultra did extremely well compared to a dual-band Garmin watch in our tests, only 0.01 miles off after nearly 10 miles. This accuracy should apply to the Watch 7, as well.</p>

<p><strong>AGEs index (and future health data): </strong>With those extra LED colors, Samsung tracks your body&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">advanced glycation end products (AGEs) index</a>, or the products that form in your bloodstream in response to excess sugar; a high AGEs index can be a warning sign for serious health conditions like diabetes or heart disease.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s announcement claims that this new metric is "one of the many new advanced features planned for the next Galaxy Watch" enabled by the new LED colors. In other words, any new health metrics Samsung works on will come to the Watch 7, but <em>not</em> the Watch 6 because of its limited LED colors. </p><p>We can&apos;t say whether this health data will be worth the update, and the Watch 6 already catches several health warning signs. The Galaxy Watch 7 is future-proofed for health data, but you could probably wait another year for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Watch 8</a>, when Samsung has implemented more of these mysterious health features.</p><p><strong>A thicker Galaxy Watch 7:</strong> Samsung says that the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 6 are 9.7mm and 9.0mm thick, respectively. Neither is that skinny; Samsung doesn&apos;t include its BioSensor when measuring its watches, which is quite misleading. In truth, the Watch 6 is about 12mm thick, while the Watch 7 is at least 13mm thick. </p><p>Our Watch 7 reviewer noted that "The dome of the array curves higher, making the watch sit higher on lanky wrists like mine, but for thicker wrists, you shouldn&apos;t notice much of a difference." In other words, the new and improved health data has a visual impact on how it looks in real life, even if it&apos;s identical from the top-down.</p><p><strong>Colors and watch band options:</strong> The Watch 6 shipped in Graphite, Gold, and Silver, while the Watch 7 comes in Green, Cream, and Silver. </p><p>Aesthetics aside, the Watch 6 had more band options at launch: Sport, Extreme Sport, Hybrid Leather D or Leather T, and Fabric. The Galaxy Watch 7 has three core options: Fabric, Sport, and Athleisure. As always, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">third-party Galaxy Watch 7 band options</a>, but fans of leather or more breathable sport bands might be disappointed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="9UNAC8Hicc5fbuv4o2dZTb" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-media-playback-youtube-music.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's media playback controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UNAC8Hicc5fbuv4o2dZTb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The Galaxy Watch 7 uses one ARM Cortex-A78 1.6GHz core and four Cortex-A55 1.5GHz cores; the Watch 6 uses dual Cortex-A55 1.4GHz cores. As you might expect, this gives the Watch 7 much more capacity for high-end processing and faster app loading times.</p><p>In practice, our Watch 7 reviewer noted that it&apos;s "the zippiest smartwatch I&apos;ve ever used, but it&apos;s not magnitudes faster" than the Watch 6, "at least during everyday activities." That&apos;s similar to my experience with the Watch Ultra, which shares the Watch 7 chip; it loads apps very quickly, but the Watch 6 was also quite fast thanks to the comparable RAM.</p><p>Some of its extra performance capacity goes directly into running the extra LED sensors, which require more power to run. Otherwise, the Exynos W1000 is more future-proofed for future Wear OS updates, which might take more advantage of the extra power.</p><p><strong>Storage: </strong>The Galaxy Watch 6 has 16GB of storage, or less than 6GB once you account for default Wear OS software. That doesn&apos;t leave much wiggle room if you like to download music, podcasts, or audiobooks for streaming on the go while leaving your phone behind. Thankfully, the Watch 7 has boosted storage space up to 32GB, giving you more wiggle room for media and apps.</p>

<p><strong>(Slight) battery life boost: </strong>Samsung never gave us an official battery life estimate for the Galaxy Watch 7. Our reviewer found that it lasted two days (48 hours) with standard use and sleep tracking, while it lasted closer to 33–36 hours with more outdoor use (which uses more nits of brightness) and one dual-band GPS workout.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 was rated to last 40 hours at launch, and yours has probably lost a little of its capacity since then. Our Watch 7 reviewer credits the Exynos W1000&apos;s "improved efficiency" as being able to handle certain tasks without as much battery burn, and it&apos;s fair to say that the Watch 6 will be less capable of handling demanding app tasks moving forward.</p><p>As a side note, some early Galaxy Watch 7 users have reported the opposite, with their watch barely lasting a day per charge. We&apos;re hoping this stems from early Wear OS 5 bugs that&apos;ll be resolved soon, since they would presumably affect the Watch 6, too.</p><p>If you&apos;re not much of an active Wear OS user and primarily use your Galaxy Watch 6 to check notifications and the weather, you&apos;re probably fine. Power users will benefit from a little extra capacity, but you&apos;ll need the Ultra for a true boost.</p><p><strong>No more Wireless PowerSharing: </strong>An unintended side effect of the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s health sensor redesign is that it prevented Samsung from making it compatible with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Wireless PowerSharing</a> standard. </p><p>You can no longer charge the Watch 7 (or Ultra) by placing it atop your flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>, while you still can do so with the Galaxy Watch 6. It&apos;s a useful trick if your Watch 6 dies and you don&apos;t have a charging puck on hand, though quite finicky if your phone has a protective case.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KRotNvqeMknorvCre7tVzD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-1.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRotNvqeMknorvCre7tVzD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is offering a trade-in deal of a $99 Watch 7 and a free second band in exchange for your Watch 6. As long as that deal&apos;s available, you have plenty of reasons to upgrade. If you&apos;re paying full price or own the Watch 6 Classic, it&apos;s harder to justify the switch.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is significantly better than the Watch 6 in key areas, with only a couple of minor drawbacks with its thickness and disabled PowerSharing in exchange for better health and fitness data. It&apos;s not <em>that</em> much faster than the Watch 6, and Samsung has to figure out the current battery drain issue, but it&apos;s more than we expected, given many Android watches keep the same CPU across generations. </p><p>If you have the Watch 6 Classic, you&apos;ll lose your stylish steel design and better bezel controls in exchange for all of the above perks and a lighter fit. That&apos;s probably a tough pill to swallow unless you <em>don&apos;t</em> like your Classic.</p><p>As for standard Galaxy Watch 6 owners, you may want to wait another generation for the differences to be more significant. This could depend, however, on whether you believe the rumors that Samsung wants to switch to a squircle design with future watches. If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> ends up with a squircle display — which Apple users love and plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> owners hate — then maybe there&apos;s no reason to wait.</p>
