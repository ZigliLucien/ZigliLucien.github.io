<ul><li>Microsoft is launching a brand new mixed reality experience in Windows with Volumetric Apps on the Meta Quest platform.</li><li>Developers can sign up to preview the new development API, allowing them to bring their existing apps into 3D space.</li><li>Microsoft says that its example app, Creo, took only a single day to turn into a Volumetric App with the new API.</li></ul>

<p>Microsoft may have pulled the plug on its Windows Mixed Reality VR platform at the end of 2023, but the company continues to invest in other VR platforms with yet another new announcement. The company says that Volumetric Apps, its answer to Apple&apos;s Spatial apps, will be coming to Meta Quest headsets via the Windows platform in the near future.</p><p>Developers can sign up for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.co/ru5kdOmtqW">Volumetric Apps API</a> and be among the first to migrate apps into a spatial environment, making it easier for customers to interface with them while wearing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> headset.</p><p>Microsoft showed off the new API at Build 2024, its annual developer conference, but kept the presentation short. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1792974464424317307">one-minute demo</a>, Microsoft showed off Creo, a CAD-based engineering software, along with the user manipulating and customizing an Xbox controller in 3D space.</p>

<p>Microsoft says that Volumetric Apps will be coming to the Meta Quest platform, suggesting that the company is further enhancing its relationship with Meta and potentially providing a Quest-exclusive way to run Windows.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft announced that Meta Quest 3 users will be able to use Windows 11 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-oculus-quest-is-getting-windows-11-and-microsoft-office">from the headset</a> but has yet to reveal more specific plans. Presumably, Microsoft will utilize Meta&apos;s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/">Quest Link</a> software so users can connect to their PCs either wirelessly or via a USB-C cable.</p><p>In addition to Volumetric Apps, Meta Quest owners can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xbox-game-pass-meta-quest-launch">stream Xbox Game Pass</a> to their headsets and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/microsoft-office-is-finally-available-on-meta-quest-headsets">use Microsoft Office</a>. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">limited edition Xbox-branded Meta Quest headset</a> is also expected to arrive sometime later this year.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a stylish, premium-feeling smartphone with excellent performance and battery life; you like to buy your phones unlocked. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want the absolute best camera technology on the market (if so, look towards Google or Samsung); you&apos;re looking for a trade-in deal. </p><p>As senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda stated in his glowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12 review</a>, this flagship phone easily "holds its own against the best that Samsung, Xiaomi, and Google have to offer". You get a truly stunning 120Hz OLED display with two days of battery life on a single charge, plus some great camera tech and five years of software updates guaranteed. </p><p>Sure, you could spend a little more on a Galaxy S24 Ultra or Pixel 8 Pro and receive marginally better camera tech and some newfangled AI features, but if you don&apos;t need all of those bells and whistles, you&apos;ll enjoy an equally-great experience for considerably less cash by going with the OnePlus 12. </p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, this offer really only makes sense for folks who like to buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">unlocked phones</a>.

<ul><li>More users are beginning to notice Google's new single-line text field redesign for Messages.</li><li>Previously, the field would contain various shortcuts but those will are now lessened and will disappear once a user begins typing.</li><li>Google started testing an edit button for texts in its Messages beta, giving users 15 minutes to go back and fix mistakes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Messages is starting to pick up its text field redesign as it rolls out "widely" to more users.</p><p>The redesign moves many of the icons that muddled the text field, bringing a cleaner single-line design, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/22/google-messages-single-line-text-field/">9to5Google</a>. The UI previously held icons for Magic Compose and Gallery, among others.</p><p>Now, what users should begin noticing is an emoji smile (icon) on the far left of the text box. The far right will now display a plus icon, opening the sub-menu for your gallery, GIF search, stickers, files, and more.</p><p>The redesign sees the text field go from the left side of your screen to the right before hitting the vocal moods icon by default. Inside, users will notice an emoji smile (icon) on the far left of the text box. The far right will now display a gallery and a plus icon, which opens the sub-menu for your gallery, GIF search, stickers, files, and more.</p><p>However, once you begin typing, the gallery icon disappears, leaving the plus icon ready to open up that secondary panel.</p>

<p>Curiously, 9to5 notes that while the update has been seen more widely, users on the stable version of Messages still have the old look. The previous single-line field design slid the box over to the right, giving ample space for auxiliary icons. Our internal tests with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> show that the right-aligned text field is still active in stable mode.</p><p>If you&apos;re also seeing this, continue to check for updates for Messages as we enter the later portion of the week.</p><p>With this slight redesign arriving for the stable app version, Google has started a test for beta testers, which involves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-text-editing-beta-changes-spotted">a text edit button</a>. Long-pressing a recently sent text will produce a pencil (edit) icon on the top bar. Users can quickly correct any mistakes, which will be reflected on the other parties&apos; devices. Note: users have a shorter 15-minute time limit to edit texts, instead of 30, as previously seen.</p><p>May also held the debut of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-starts-getting-voice-moods-and-recorder-redesign">Voice Moods</a>" in Messages. Users can access nine voice moods alongside relevant emojis to tack onto it. The cards users see in their messaging threads are colorful and fun, with emojis plastered all around them.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has reportedly decided to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC in the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 "exclusively" in 2024.</li><li>The report suggests that the company considered "cost control" and "efficiency" when making the decision.</li><li>It was previously rumored that Samsung would swap Qualcomm and its Exynos chip in the U.S. and other regions, as it did last year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new report claims that Samsung is preparing to lean on Qualcomm&apos;s latest flagship chip only for its upcoming foldable phones.</p><p>The information stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4847">The Elec</a> (Korean), who states the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 will only feature the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/22/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-snapdragon-8-gen-3-report/">9to5Google</a>). The devices are expected to see the "For Galaxy" tag attached to the chipset, similar to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">flagship smartphones</a>, once they launch.</p><p>Additionally, the publications added that Samsung "considered cost control" when choosing Qualcomm&apos;s chip. The report states that Samsung based its creation of the Flip 6 and Fold 6 on Qualcomm&apos;s flagship chip.</p><p>The company would reportedly run the risk of driving up the cost of its devices if another processor was tossed into the mix.</p><p>The other processor this is referring to is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">Exynos 2400</a>. The publication states that Samsung did not snub its own SoC due to its performance. Rather, siding with Qualcomm throughout was made on the foundation of "efficiency."</p><p>Moreover, it seems that the company is waiting for its Z series foldables to reach the numbers of its S series phones "before adding another processor."</p>

<p>In March, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">it was speculated</a> that Samsung would follow a route similar to the Galaxy S24 series. The company packed the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the devices for the U.S. but slid in the Exynos 2400 in other regions. The change in chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">didn&apos;t seem like a bad thing</a>, as Samsung boosted its in-house chip with a new CPU and NPU for speed and other enhancements.</p><p>However, Samsung reportedly plans to shift to Qualcomm exclusivity for its foldables in 2024, which could be a boon for consumers.</p><p>Those rumors suggested the Flip 6 could feature a 120Hz refresh rate cover display, an upgrade over last year&apos;s 60Hz. The clamshell could pick up an 8GB and a 12GB RAM variant alongside a 256GB and 512GB storage option. Its crease could also become <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-display-crease-reduction-rumor">a little less visible</a> with a thicker UTG (ultra-thin glass).</p><p>On the other hand, the Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-z-fold-6-may-skip-a-key-upgrade-for-smartphones-in-2024">was rumored</a> to forgo any battery upgrades in 2024, as speculation stated it would stick with 25W charging speeds. This is likely to be paired with the same 4,400mAh battery.</p><p>Samsung is expected to debut both devices for its summer Unpacked later this year. The event could occur even earlier this year on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors surface, regarding the Galaxy Ring's supposed $300 to $350 price range in the U.S.</li><li>The tipster on X then claimed that Samsung is looking at bringing a subscription service to the Samsung Health app for "under $10."</li><li>The Galaxy Ring is expected to come in a wide range of American ring sizes, potentially from 5 to 13 and with a rumored 10-day battery life.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Speculation suggests Samsung could price its smart ring similarly to Oura&apos;s, alongside a rumored subscription service.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1793155170093969897">Yogesh Brar</a> on X, Samsung may price the Galaxy Ring anywhere between $300 and $350 in the U.S. (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-subscription-price-leak-3445434/">Android Authority</a>). Notably, this supposed pricing range is similar to how Oura prices its smart ring. Brar adds that Samsung&apos;s version could see a ₹35,000 price tag in India.</p><p>However, a discussion between the tipster and the publication unearthed the possibility of a subscription service for the Ring. Citing unnamed sources, Brar reportedly stated that the Galaxy Ring "could" come with a monthly subscription service priced "under $10."</p><p>It&apos;s worth remembering that Oura&apos;s monthly plan for its app sits at $5.99.</p>

<p>The subscription service idea isn&apos;t entirely new, as the publication highlights an interview between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/26/samsung-galaxy-ring-specs-features-release-date.html#:~:text=The%20executive%20also%20said%20the%20company%20is%20%E2%80%9Cconsidering%E2%80%9D%20a%20subscription%20service%20for%20its%20Samsung%20Health%20app%2C%20but%20that%20the%20capabilities%20and%20insights%20it%20offers%20need%20to%20be%20improved%20before%20that%20can%20happen.%20AI%20assistants%20can%20help.">CNBC</a> and Samsung&apos;s Dr. Hon Pak. During the interview, the Korean OEM&apos;s Head of Digital Health mentioned there was "consideration" behind a service for the Samsung Health app.</p><p>Pak did not get into specifics but did mention that improvements to the app&apos;s insights and capabilities were needed before a service could occur.</p><p>There&apos;s a possibility that the supposed pricing "range" for the Galaxy Ring could involve a leak from April. Last month, the device&apos;s various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">model identification numbers</a> appeared, pointing toward its many ring sizes.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">standalone Gemini app</a> in February 2024, but today — months later — it&apos;s still unavailable for some phones that meet the requirements like the Moto Razr. </p><p>Officially, the requirements for the app are very light. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14579026?hl=en">According to Google</a>&apos;s support page on Gemini, "the Gemini mobile app is available on Android phones, including many foldables, with 2 GB of RAM or more, running Android 10 and up." You also have to have your phone set to one of 19 supported languages and live in one of over 150 supported countries.</p>
<p>So yeah, these requirements are really easy to meet but don&apos;t tell the whole story. They never do.</p><p>We reached out to Google about this and they told us “<em>The Razr isn’t supported just yet but we are working on it and aim to have it available soon.</em>” This doesn&apos;t really answer the question of why. Everyone is sure that Google will make it available one day but there always seems to be some other hidden set of rules about which phones see which features, and when.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1162px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Vhqv3twceBdZgLJDHzxTQU" name="Gemini.png" alt="Google Gemini app availability" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vhqv3twceBdZgLJDHzxTQU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1162" height="654" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not just the Razr, either. You would think Google wants Gemini available for all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, but it isn&apos;t. For example, the Gemini app is officially available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. Some carrier models, though, can&apos;t install it. That&apos;s the case with the AT&T version I have here on my desk. There seems to be no rhyme or reason and without a list of all supported devices — which Google does not provide — you have to try it yourself to know if you can get the app.</p><p>To make things even more confusing, the app was available for a short time for some phones that are no longer supported. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Moto Razr</a> you could install it from Google Play when it was first released but now it&apos;s gone and you&apos;re left with an unsupported app that could have security and functionality issues.</p>
<p>Since there is no obvious technical reason as to why, it has to be something else right? I mean if the Razr (which meets all the requirements) was on the initial rollout list and some Z Flip models can run it without any issues it can&apos;t be hardware limitations holding it back. </p><p>This isn&apos;t exactly a new phenomenon. It seems like every time Google has a new software product initial availability is limited in some way or another. Sometimes the reasons seem to make sense, like language or region support, but other times it feels like Google is simply playing favorites. And sometimes, like with the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">circle-to-search feature</a>, Google <em>is</em> playing favorites.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Su3LQaUCmh8Do3hZzcfaxW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-comparison-3.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Razr Plus back panels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Su3LQaUCmh8Do3hZzcfaxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is an explanation that only really makes sense when you consider how many different Android phones are out there — Google is trying to control the experience and doesn&apos;t want to release anything that doesn&apos;t meet its performance expectations.</p><p>Admittedly, that feels like a low bar to set considering how ... goofy ... some Google products are at launch. Ultimately, Google just wants everything to work in a way that people don&apos;t complain about. I don&apos;t mean tech enthusiasts with high expectations, but the fabled "average consumer" that makes up the bulk of worldwide smartphone sales. They want to install the cool new thing and do cool new things with it.</p>
<p>There may be performance issues on some phones. The Moto Razr or certain software variants of the Flip 5 are very different under the hood when compared to something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>. This is bound to happen when you allow different companies to build their own OS from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">your code base</a>. Since Gemini replaces Assistant in most cases, the software wasn&apos;t built with it in mind. </p><p>I don&apos;t have the answers here, nor does anyone else who isn&apos;t working on the Gemini team at Google. I do know how to "fix" it though: transparency.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.42%;"><img id="p257SEtNaBQcbGg2AYkYUb" name="IMG_6851.jpg" alt="Google Gemini availability" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p257SEtNaBQcbGg2AYkYUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1179" height="842" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Google were to come out and say something like "There are issues with the always-listening component of Google Gemini on the Moto Razr and we&apos;re working with the team at Motorola to resolve them", nobody would hate them for it. (<em>Note that this is just an example and I have no idea what any issues may be</em>.) We all understand that writing complicated software isn&apos;t easy, and would probably appreciate that Google is trying to make sure everything works well before dumping another product on us all.</p><p>Being left in the dark is never a good look and a big reason why people think Apple does it better. Nothing is shipped until it&apos;s ready for every iPhone. Maybe those people are right and Google needs to change how it rolls out new software products.</p><p>Either way, it wouldn&apos;t hurt to let us know a bit about what&apos;s going on.</p>

<hr>
<p>Humane, the company that owns the wearable AI pin, is now looking for a potential buyer, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/wearable-ai-startup-humane-is-said-to-explore-potential-sale">Bloomberg</a>. "People familiar with the matter" told the publication that Humane is seeking a price between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale. However, the process seems to be in its initial stages and may not result in a deal. </p><p>The same source told Bloomberg that "the company is working with a financial adviser to assist the potential sale." The Information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/has-humane-created-the-next-iphone-or-the-next-google-glass?rc=bdqvyp">reported</a> that investors valued Humane at $850 million last year. For now, the company has not publicly commented on the matter. </p><p>Humane was founded in 2018 by two ex-Apple designers, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno. By 2023, they secured a massive $230 million, with some of their investors being OpenAI and Microsoft. Humane announced their AI Pin, a minimalistic magnetic, voice-controlled device with AI assistance that allows users to do everything from making calls to controlling music with vocal commands.</p>

<p>After months of creating a buzz about the laser-projecting wearable pin, Humane started shipping its devices in April this year for $699 and an additional $24/month subscription + taxes and fees. </p><p>Following several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://autogpt.net/humane-ai-pin-is-seeking-a-buyer-after-facing-challenges/#:~:text=Struggles%20and%20Criticisms,concept%20behind%20the%20AI%20Pin.">complaints</a> about the pin&apos;s cost-effectiveness, slow response rate, and accuracy, the company took to X to inform users that they were bringing Ai Mic accuracy improvements across user support, video stabilization, and contacts experience improvements. </p><p>On May 15, following Open AI&apos;s multimodal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-trying-to-steal-scarlett-johanssons-voice-to-make-ai-feel-comfortable-is-the-reason-why-its-so-worrying">GPT-4o launch</a>, Humane announced that it would integrate GPT-4o into the Ai Bus to help the pin understand and react to voice requests. This means that the AI pin will depend highly on OpenAI&apos;s software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">leaving it vulnerable</a> to the choice that users would eventually make, i.e., they might choose to get similar features on their phones rather than spending $700 on a dedicated AI pin. </p>

<ul><li>Meta Quest update v66 is now in beta testing for folks enrolled in the PTC channel.</li><li>VR analyst Luna found several new features in testing including Ray-Ban Meta AI, a wrist button, a resizable virtual keyboard, groundwork for more realistic avatars, and more.</li><li>Hardware improvements include more granular brightness adjustment settings for the Quest Pro, integration of Android's Bluetooth Quick Pair feature, and new sensor privacy features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta Quest update v66 began rolling out to Public Test Channel (PTC) members last week, and VR analyst Luna took the time to tear down the new update to see everything that&apos;s new, including new features hidden within the operating system code.</p><p>Published at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-ptc-v66-datamining-insights-luna/">UploadVR</a>, Luna&apos;s data mining of Quest update v66 reveals nearly a dozen new features that haven&apos;t been fully surfaced, meaning they&apos;re coded into the operating system but don&apos;t necessarily have a button or switch to enable just yet.</p><p>The most interesting of the bunch is the inclusion of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">Meta AI Assistant</a> we first saw roll out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> at the end of 2023. Since then, the assistant has gained several new features thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta&apos;s Llama 3</a> AI model which can run locally on-device.</p><p>That could give players significant upgrades to voice commands over the current voice assistant. Based on prior updates, this new AI assistant may be able to visually identify objects in the room or potentially automatically map the room <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-v64-room-scanning-update">even better than before</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cudaQURCKwo5DPJxkL8Zkh" name="Samsung-fast-pair-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-Fold-4.jpg" alt="Setting up a Galaxy S23 Ultra with fast pair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cudaQURCKwo5DPJxkL8Zkh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hand-tracking games are set to get more accessibility features, including a new wrist-mounted home button. That means you can turn your hand over in any hand-tracking app or game and tap your wrist to go home. Currently, users need to perform a pinch gesture to pull up the home menu.</p><p>Meta is also working towards making the Meta Quest feel more like a spatial computer rather than just a mixed reality headset with upcoming features like a downloads folder, implementing Android&apos;s Quick Pair for Bluetooth, calendar sync, and custom virtual keyboard resizing and placement.</p><p>Quick Pair, in particular, will make it even easier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-keyboard-and-mouse-oculus-quest-2">pair a mouse and keyboard with a Meta Quest headset</a>. Plus, it&apos;s entirely possible that we&apos;ll be able to pair a Bluetooth speaker with the headset so you can control everything from there. Additionally, the improved do-not-disturb mode looks to let users schedule DnD for maximum productivity.</p><p>That should make headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">upcoming Lenovo productivity headset</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> make much more sense as proper laptop replacements rather than expensive toys.</p>

<p>Beyond that, a new sensor lock feature will keep cameras and microphones off whenever the headset is put to sleep. That means tracking might take an extra second or two to load up when a user puts the Quest on their head, but sometimes a little waiting is worth the extra privacy.</p><p>Lastly, Meta continues to work on its realistic avatar technology, further baking support into the Quest for calibration and testing. Meta&apos;s realistic avatars would require a smartphone to scan your face (see above video) but allow for avatars that look incredibly realistic when released.</p><p>As always, with a beta release, some of these features may make it into the final June v66 update, while others may be delayed for release in future updates. There&apos;s also no guarantee that any of these features will make it to a final software version, but most features available in a firmware beta tend to get released soon after public testing.</p>

<hr>
<p>OpenAI made waves last week when it announced GPT-4o, a multimodal AI model that may be the most advanced and futuristic one we’ve seen to date. It sounds like a human, can interact with users via vision and audio, and is knowledgeable. OpenAI ended up beating Google to the punch, and GPT-4o seems more advanced than Project Astra, which Google previewed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>.</p><p>But one of the voices OpenAI chose for GPT-4o has been drawing attention online for all the wrong reasons. First, some users on social media pointed out they thought the voice “Sky” was overly flirty and sultry to the point it was unsettling. Then, people started noticing the similarities between the voice of Sky and that of Scarlett Johansson, the award-winning actress. Now, it appears that may have been intentional.</p><p>To be clear, OpenAI denies that the voice of Sky was based on Johansson and even released a blog post explaining how the voices were chosen. However, Johansson put out a scathing statement telling the story of how OpenAI approached her about officially voicing GPT-4o, which she declined. After facing legal pressure from Johansson’s lawyers, the company removed the Sky voice option from GPT-4o. </p><p>As distressing as this situation is, it’s almost ironic. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman told Johansson that her voice, being the official voice of ChatGPT, would be more comforting to users. And yet, by releasing a voice so similar to Johansson‘s without her permission, Altman and OpenAI ended up perfectly encapsulating everything that makes people uncomfortable about AI. </p>
<h2 id="did-openai-steal-scarlett-johansson-x2018-s-voice-2">Did OpenAI steal Scarlett Johansson‘s voice?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP" name="ChatGPT-hero.jpg" alt="ChatGPT conversation screen on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though OpenAI says that it sought out professional voice actors for GPT-4o and did not seek someone who sounded like Johansson specifically, the evidence might tell a different story. It starts in September 2023, according to Johansson, when OpenAI’s Altman reached out about hiring her as a voice actor for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-use-chatgpt-without-an-account">ChatGPT</a>. </p><p>“He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and Al,” she said in a statement to NPR’s Bobby Allyn. “He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.”</p><p>Johansson eventually decided not to go forward with voicing GPT-4o. However, it’s easy to hear her resemblance in the Sky voice that ended up being demoed and shipped with the AI model. To say that Johansson was displeased with the result would be an understatement. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement from Scarlett Johansson on the OpenAI situation. Wow: pic.twitter.com/8ibMeLfqP8<a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1792679435701014908">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>“We believe that AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity&apos;s distinctive voice— Sky’s voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice,“ OpenAI said in a blog post. </p><p>The whole reason that OpenAI wanted a voice like Johansson’s, as Altman is said to have told her, is to make AI more comforting. People may be more scared about AI than they are excited about it. Especially those in creative industries are finding that AI is being used to automate writing, visual art, music, and other mediums. This isn’t something unique to OpenAI — Apple recently came under fire and apologized for an advertisement that literally saw instruments being crushed into pieces and replaced with an iPad. </p>

<p>By using her likeness in a GPT-4o voice without her permission — whether intentionally or unintentionally — OpenAI ended up validating the discomfort associated with AI that it was desperately trying to address. Creatives, from actors and actresses to writers and photographers, are worried about being replaced by AI. The idea that OpenAI could have mimicked Johansson‘s voice for GPT-4o is exactly the kind of thing that worries and alarms people in creative industries. </p><p>“When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,” Johansson wrote, explaining that she asked OpenAI to show how it developed the Sky voice. “In a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity.”</p>
<h2 id="we-shouldn-x2019-t-want-ai-to-sound-this-human-2">We shouldn’t want AI to sound this human</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3635px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B" name="How to use Google Gemini on Android.jpg" alt="Using Google Gemini on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3635" height="2045" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the unsettling idea that a company could rip off an actress‘ voice after disagreeing with a deal, there are other reasons why we don’t want AI voices to sound like Sky. All of OpenAI’s GPT-4o voices, and especially Sky, sound very human-like. This is a problem, because there is a high level of trust and familiarity people have with human voices. When you talk to a voice assistant like Siri or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-device">Alexa</a>, it’s clear that you’re talking to — for lack of a better word — a robot. After having a conversation with GPT-4o, that level of clarity won’t always be in the back of your mind. </p><p>Right now, AI models have a problem, and it’s that they confidently state their answers as fact even when they are blatantly wrong. People still end up believing AI responses as true despite the array of warnings that come along with them. As voices for AI models become more human-sounding, this problem will only get worse. It’ll be easy for the average user of an AI tool to believe what is being said thanks to the welcoming human voice it uses. </p><p>In trying to make people more comfortable with the future of AI, OpenAI ended up making it feel <em>more</em> dystopian. We shouldn’t want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">AI to sound as human as GPT-4o</a>, and there are plenty of reasons why. It could foster an unwarranted level of trust between users and AI models, as well as put creatives like Johansson In a precarious position.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/swappable-popsockets-review">PopSockets</a> are some of the most popular and widely-used phone grips on the market for a reason: they last a long time, really help <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/popsockets-and-phone-grips-why-they-matter-and-why-you-should-use-one" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/popsockets-and-phone-grips-why-they-matter-and-why-you-should-use-one">reduce the stress</a> on your hands, and come in more styles than you can possibly imagine. PopSockets are also impressively affordable, but PopGrips with premium materials and franchised designs can get a little pricey for such a small plastic accessory.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Once you pop a PopTop, you'll find it hard to stop.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One of the more addictive aspects of PopSockets is its trademarked accordion design, which pops in and out in a satisfying fashion. The biggest issue with the older PopSocket design was the thickness that interfered with wireless charging. You also had to either pry the whole darn thing off your phone or disassemble the tops in order to swap them. PopSockets decided to fix both of these issues with the Swappable PopGrips and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/get-a-magsafe-popsocket-this-black-friday-i-put-one-on-my-pixel-and-it-was-a-game-changer">PopSockets for MagSafe</a>.</p><p>By allowing you to twist off PopTops from the PopGrip base, you can remove the bulk while using wireless charging, great news as wireless charging expands to more and more phones. You can also swap PopGrip designs to match your outfit, mood, or even Poptivism PopGrips that support a wide variety of charities like The Trevor Project, March for Our Lives, and Charity: Water. Just be mindful that once you start a PopGrip collection, they can get slightly addictive.</p>

<p>While PopSockets are more prevalent, popular, and diversely designed, some folks simply prefer the traditional ring-style design. The Spigen Style Ring 360 is more functional than PopSockets, which makes it a better grip for a lot of users that can see beyond PopSockets&apos; cutesy designs.</p><p>Ring grips are awesome because you only need one finger to use them, as opposed to at least two with the PopSockets. The Style Ring 360 also allows you to flip it over and hang your phone off the back of your hand when you need both hands to carry something like a food tray or grocery bags.</p><p>The Style Ring 360 can allow your phone to sit flat on a tabletop, and a magnetic plate is hidden in that flat back so that you can use it with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-magnetic-car-mounts">magnetic car mounts</a>, too. Of course, that plate inhibits wireless charging, but metal grips almost always interfere with that anyway. Thanks to the 360-degree rotation of the base and the 180-degree hinge on the ring itself, you can use it as a kickstand in landscape or portrait mode on most phones so long as you don&apos;t stick it to your case too close to the bottom.</p><p>Plastic grips like PopSockets can potentially last a lot longer than metal grips like the Style Ring 360, whose bearings and hinge will inevitably wear out over the course of several months. It depends on how heavily you use it and how heavy your phone is.</p>

<p>As noted, I have been using HANDL New York&apos;s flexible brace for many years and it has become one of my favorite phone accessories. The flexible brace, designed by a painter who got his inspiration from how he held his palette in his hand, the grip stretches out to wrap around your fingers. Hold it like that while taking a selfie or recording video, even twisting the phone whichever way you need (great for lefties like me!)</p><p>When you&apos;re down, let go and it falls right back into place. Stretch to click the top into the bottom and voila! You have a handy kickstand as well. You get so used to clicking, flexing, and holding that it becomes second nature. I even find it useful to simply hold your phone at your side while you walk using the brace: it won&apos;t fall out!</p><p>With tons of colors and designs from which to choose, keep in mind that it does protrude slightly from the back of the phone which means it won&apos;t sit flat on a table or other surface. Depending on how much you use it, the brace will also wear over time, though it took several years for this to happen to mine.</p>

<p>This snappy silver/black grip can serve as a kickstand, a phone grip, and either a standalone car mount or a mounting plate for a magnetic mount thanks to the bi-stable metal spring inside. That spring is insanely durable, which means that unlike a Spigen Style Ring 360 or Speck GrabTab, the Scooch Wingback Universal will definitely last you years and years.</p><p>While the actual in-hand grip with the Scooch isn&apos;t quite as natural for smaller fingers, it&apos;s easy to get the hang of and its kickstand is far superior thanks to that springy metal back. It may wobble in portrait mode from time to time, but it won&apos;t slowly sink and flatten the way portrait kickstands on most phone grips will.</p><p>The Scooch Wingback Universal produces an angle that&apos;s high enough to easily reference notes on your phone while typing on your computer. You can easily snap this grip flat or push it out with one hand. It may not be the cheapest grip on this list, but it&apos;s certainly the most well-made one.</p>

<p>Popsockets makes a second entry on this list for its phone grip that&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">compatible with MagSafe</a>, allowing you to use it with virtually any case, turning it into a wireless charging compatible one. Available in a range of colors, it magnetically attaches to a case using the included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">magnetic adapter ring</a>, and then can be used like any other Popsocket.</p><p>The advantage here is that it&apos;s simple to remove as well as put on without the need for adhesives. Just keep in mind that while it works with most cell phone cases, this grip is best on cases that aren&apos;t made of silicone, that aren&apos;t textured, and that don&apos;t have an anti-fingerprint coating.</p><p>Once you want to recharge your phone, slide the grip off, charge, and then pop it back on like magic. While this one is slightly more expensive than others, the ability to transform a cheap old case into a high-tech one, and wirelessly charge your phone is worth it.</p>

<p>While in-hand use is the most important part of phone grip usage, the CLCKR Phone Grip and Expanding Stand can do so much more than that. It doubles as a sturdy portrait and landscape kickstand, giving you two phone accessories in one compact package. While most phone grips can be landscape kickstands in a pinch, they can&apos;t hack it vertically, but CLCKR is one of the few that actually makes for a darn good vertical kickstand.</p><p>You can snap the CLCKR&apos;s strap between flat and a kickstand, and you can leave it loose as a hand strap when holding the phone as you walk around. Unlike the Speck GrabTab, the strap doesn&apos;t bow up or flop around when not in use; it snaps back into place to stay flat and out of the way. Unlike the Scooch, the kickstand won&apos;t bounce around since it locks into place properly. It also comes in a half-dozen materials and finishes and several colors of each.</p><p>The only real problem with the CLCKR is that you can&apos;t use it on smaller phones or phones with a rear fingerprint sensor. You might find it dominating the rear of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">petite Android phone</a> like the Galaxy S24 or Pixel 8. Also, while 4.2mm isn&apos;t very thick for a phone grip, it&apos;s still too thick to allow for wireless charging.</p>

<p>Plastic and metal grips can last a long time, but they can also be hard to grip for hours and hours on end if you&apos;re a power user. That&apos;s where fabric grips like the LoveHandle come in. This adorable little bow can help you avoid wearing out your fingers pinching a PopSocket or slinging a Style Ring 360, and since it&apos;s an elastic fabric strap, it&apos;s available in so many cute and adorable styles.</p><p>Of course, fabric can have its own pitfalls: elastic wears out over time, especially if you have a habit of yo-yo-ing your phone on your finger when you&apos;re bored. Fabric can also pick up stains and smells from spilled coffee and greasy, sweaty fingers, so you&apos;ll want to take care to keep your hands and your LoveHandle clean.</p><p>The LoveHandle Universal Grip is also one of the few phone grips on the market to not have any kickstand ability at all. However, that just means it&apos;s doing one thing well instead of trying to do two things poorly like many phone grips. You won&apos;t find any comfort or wireless charging incompatibility issues here.</p>

<p>Phone grips tend to monopolize the back of your phone, and if you&apos;re used to keeping a stick-on card slot back there for your work ID or credit card, good news! You can get stick-on wallets with phone grips attached. Sinjimoru makes a wide array of these card pouches, including a couple of models with elastic phone grips on the back, but the Sinji Pouch B-Flap is the best of the bunch.</p><p>Despite the rather bland name, this grip comes in one of five warm colors including ruby red and autumn gold. The Sinjimoru Sinji Pouch B-Flap has room for up to five cards or cash, and the elastic strap can be used with one to four fingers slipped through it, whatever is the most comfortable for you.</p><p>Like the LoveHandle, the elastic here can wear out over time, but some users have also reported seams busting after a few months as well. If you tend to be hard on your tech, you might want to opt for a metal or plastic grip instead.</p>

<h2 id="why-popsockets-are-the-best-phone-grips-2">Why PopSockets are the best phone grips</h2>
<p>While there are about as many phone grip styles as there are case styles out there, PopSockets remain the most popular because they work well, last a long time, and with the newer Swappable PopGrips style, they&apos;re both easier to upgrade to a new style and use with Qi wireless charging.</p><p>PopSockets come in hundreds upon hundreds of styles, including Poptivism styles that benefit specific charities of just about every type you could imagine. Whether you want to swap out for PopTops that highlight your Disney fangirling or support your team on game day, there&apos;s probably a PopSocket for that. Another useful quirk of PopSockets is that they can double as fidget toys to help keep me from spacing out during staff meetings. These all help PopSockets be part toy, part tool, making them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-grips-students">perfect for kids, too</a>.</p><p>If you prefer a phone grip you can hook a finger through rather than having to pinch the PopSockets&apos; plastic accordion, the Spigen Style Ring 360 is a great ring grip that works well as a kickstand, too. And if you want more flexibility (literally), I urge you to consider the HANDLstick as well.</p><p>Without a PopSocket or another grip, holding a large phone isn&apos;t just inconvenient; it can actually develop into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-i-use-phone-grip">repetitive stress injury</a>, especially if you spend a lot of time on a keyboard.
