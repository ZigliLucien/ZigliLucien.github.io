<ul><li>A dive into Google's Device Health Services app shows signs of a new "Adaptive Thermal" feature for Pixels.</li><li>The feature seems designed to help users take the necessary measures if their Pixel is overheating, which the feature will alert them to.</li><li>Adaptive Thermal features various warning states if a Pixel's temperature is rising too high before shutting itself down for protection.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google is working on a way to help users keep their Pixels cool if it&apos;s running a risk of overheating.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-adaptive-thermal-3453215/">Android Authority</a>, version 1.27 of the Device Health Services app on Pixels holds clues about "Adaptive Thermal." Early strings of code in the app suggest that Google&apos;s new feature will warn users if their Pixel is encroaching on those hotter temperatures so they can assist with it.</p><p>It was discovered that Adaptive Thermal will push a "pre-emergency" notification to users if their device is rising toward 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The notification is joined by a tagline reading "phone needs to cool down" and that your Pixel&apos;s performance will slow.</p><p>Google explains within the app&apos;s code that these performance "limitations" include your Pixel&apos;s speed, the disabling of your 5G network connection, "and more."</p><p>The feature will also offer a few suggestions users can use to cool down their Pixel when tapping "See care steps." The code shows that users might see the following options:</p>
<ul><li>Try avoiding direct sunlight</li><li>Put your phone in the open for airflow</li><li>Close any battery-intensive apps like videos, games, and the camera</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman states that Adaptive Thermal will continuously check on your device&apos;s temperature every five minutes. If your Pixel hasn&apos;t gotten better and instead rises in temperature to 126 degrees or above, this will activate its "emergency" state. While it sounds serious, Rahman adds that he couldn&apos;t see the details of that phase.</p><p>Additionally, if the temperature rises considerably to 131 degrees or higher, your device will warn you of an impending shutdown. The code shows that Adaptive Thermal will warn you that your Pixel shut off in 30 seconds for protection.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans on rolling this feature out to Pixels, but it could arrive on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">Pixel 9 series</a> if anything.</p><p>It&apos;s nothing new to say that Google&apos;s Pixel series has a bad history of overheating, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-6-battery-overheating-issues">the problems Pixel 7 and 6 users</a> faced last year. Those issues followed a security patch where users on Reddit reported a severe rise in device temperature, followed by a costly drain on their batteries.</p><p>The Pixel 8 series encountered some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">overheating issues</a> later last year, as well. It didn&apos;t appear widespread, however, several users reported that their devices would get quite warm when browsing the internet and while charging.</p>

<ul><li>A new report from alleged sources close to the matter states Amazon is looking to charge anywhere from $5 to $10 for its "Remarkable Alexa" (Alexa Plus).</li><li>Amazon intends for the AI to help users with shopping queries while a stronger variant is being developed for "complicated queries."</li><li>The report adds that Amazon has faced severe problems with its next-gen AI, such as fabricated information, alongside "poor employee morale."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A few more details about Amazon&apos;s proposed future for its AI assistant, Alexa, and how it will impact consumers have surfaced.</p><p>The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-mulls-5-10-monthly-price-tag-unprofitable-alexa-service-ai-revamp-2024-06-21/">Reuters</a>, which cites several people close to the project known internally as "Banyan." According to its sources, Amazon is thinking of including "two tiers of service" for this new Alexa. Its sources claim this could involve a $5 monthly charge or a $10 fee for this "Remarkable Alexa."</p><p>Reuters adds that Amazon is facing a "must-win" scenario. The company is reportedly moving toward infusing Alexa with even stronger AI brains to empower users when they visit the website. The publication&apos;s sources stated that working Alexa deeper into Amazon is to help customers with "shopping advice" and other purchase-related queries.</p><p>However, this won&apos;t come without cost, and it seems Amazon is considering two different price points. The company is allegedly considering replacing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-alexa">Classic Alexa</a>" (its free variant) with a stronger AI version alongside another that leverages AI software for "complicated" tasks. The paid variant of Alexa is rumored to feature email composure, ordering from UberEats, and more from a "single prompt."</p><p>Moreover, it seems that Amazon isn&apos;t considering some sort of AI "bundle" with its higher-priced Prime membership plan.</p><p>It seems that Amazon is feeling pressured due to advances made by Google with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and its many models, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">Microsoft&apos;s Copilot</a>, and OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT. The report adds that the unnamed sources who&apos;ve come forward are hesitant about Amazon&apos;s decision to begin charging for a "revamped" version of Alexa&apos;s free services.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="s2sz9BpQpUK6ukF4FgHeDG" name="Amazon-alexa-on-pixel-6-pro-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Amazon Alexa on Pixel 6 Pro with Echo speakers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s2sz9BpQpUK6ukF4FgHeDG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are also rumors that Amazon&apos;s development of this new "Remarkable Alexa" has been hindered by AI hallucinations. The AI has supposedly fabricated information, which was often "false or misleading." Moreover, the company has had to wrangle with "poor employee morale."</p><p>Murmurings about "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-working-on-premium-alexa">Remarkable Alexa</a>" or "Alexa Plus" have been tumbling about since January. Those early reports stated that Amazon had around 15,000 users putting the new AI assistant through the wringer to iron out those problems. Again, rumors of severe development problems and delays were a recurring theme throughout that previous post.</p><p>The company is reportedly interested in launching Alexa Plus on June 30.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing published its Phone 2a sustainability report alongside its 2023 report for its devices.</li><li>The company states the Phone 2a features almost 50 parts made from "bio-based and recycled materials" with a lower 52kg CO2e carbon footprint.</li><li>Elsewhere, Nothing reports that it has moved to remove the usage of PVC and brominated flame retardants in all of its products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is detailing its 2023 sustainability report, offering insight into how it worked to reduce its carbon footprint and become more eco-friendly.</p><p>The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0376/5420/0459/files/Phone_2a_Sustainability_Report_250324.pdf?v=1718713388">published reports</a> for its lower-cost Nothing Phone 2a and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0376/5420/0459/files/2023_Sustainability_Report_-_05_22.pdf?v=1718713388">overall outlook</a> from the previous year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/nothing-sustainability-report-pvc-eliminated/">Android Police</a>). For the Phone 2a, Nothing states that 46 of the device&apos;s parts contain "bio-based and recycled materials" such as plastic, aluminum steel, tin, and copper. As such, the company reduced its carbon footprint through the Phone 2a to 52kg CO2e.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a&apos;s</a> packaging is another area that is seeing eco-friendly changes, as the report states it&apos;s plastic-free. Nothing adds that 60% of its Phone 2a packaging is derived from "recycled sources."</p><p>The phone&apos;s packaging utilizes "special links" during its printing to avoid lamination. Additionally, the company avoided your typical plastic adhesives in favor of paper-based alternatives.</p><p>Nothing offered a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1803810657827242055">key highlights</a> about its 2023 report, stating that 20% of its flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> comprises recycled materials. Throughout its lifecycle, Nothing states this has helped the Phone 2 achieve an 8.6% lower carbon footprint over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Phone 1</a> at 53.45 kg CO2e.</p><p>Another major takeaway is that Nothing reports that it has removed the use of PVC in available products alongside brominated flame retardants (BFR). The report continues, stating that PVC endangers the health of humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle from creation to disposal. Nothing has reportedly worked since 2022 to eliminate PVC from its products, as it&apos;s a common material for wrapping wires in cables.</p>

<p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-three-years-os-updates">got candid</a> about its endeavors into a more environmentally-focused mindset last year in May. The Phone 2&apos;s carbon footprint reduction was labeled as a "significant achievement" considering the performance boosts Nothing provided. Elsewhere, the company stated that the device&apos;s mid-frame is made out of 100% recycled aluminum with 100% recycled copper making up its main circuit board.</p><p>Even the Phone 2&apos;s packaging cut back on harmful materials as Nothing highlighted its usage of over 60% FSC Mix-certified recycled fiber. The company also announced its partnership with the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) and the IRMA to continue on a path that&apos;s safer for the environment.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify has brought in a new basic plan for individuals and families in the U.S.</li><li>It costs $10.99 per month, but it has the benefits of the Premium Individual plan without audiobooks.</li><li>The same plan is available for six members under the Basic Family plan, which reportedly costs $16.99 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify users in the U.S. can now take advantage of a new Basic plan that offers all the benefits of a Premium plan without audiobook listening time.</p><p>The streaming giant recently hiked its Premium individual plan from $10.99 to $11.99 monthly. It now has the $10.99 plan dubbed the Basic plan with limitations.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the music streaming benefits of your Premium plan without the monthly audiobook listening time. Starting at $10.99/month for eligible users, "Spotify notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-06-21/more-choice-for-us-subscribers/">announcement post</a>. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/21/spotify-basic-plans-audiobooks/">9to5Google</a> states that users, for some reason, can&apos;t "directly sign up for the new plan" through Spotify&apos;s website but rather can downgrade to the new plan, provided they are already existing individual plan users.</p>
<p>The new introduction of the Basic plan confirms the recent Bloomberg report, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-price-increase-new-plans-claims">shared Spotify&apos;s plans</a> to increase the Premium Individual plan by over $1 and the company&apos;s intention to introduce the latest $10.99 per month plan forgoing the audiobooks.</p><p>The new $10.99 per month plan appears to be the entry-level for subscriptions to the music streaming platform. While there is still a $9.99 per month plan, it is only for audiobook listening dubbed under the "Audiobooks Access" tier. It gives 15 hours of audiobook listening time.</p>

<p>Spotify now has some diversified plans for people in the U.S., starting with $10.99 Basic followed by Premium Individual ($11.99), which provides ad-free music online/offline next to 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month. </p><p>Then there&apos;s Premium Duo for $16.99 per month, giving the benefits of the Premium Individual plan but for two members. The Premium Family is another notable plan that costs $16.99 per month, and up to six users can take advantage of it with all $11.99 plan benefits.</p><p>9to5Google further notes that there is a new Basic Family plan costing $16.99 per month, which, for some reason, isn&apos;t mentioned in the aforementioned post but is visible for Spotify subscribers. It works similarly to the Basic plan for up to six members without audiobook listening experience.</p><p>It is interesting to see Spotify omitting the audiobook listening experience by introducing these new plans while the primary intention to increase the Premium Individual in the first place is reportedly to "cover the cost of audiobooks," according to the earlier mentioned Bloomberg report.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung announces a new color hue for the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</li><li>Dubbed Titanium Yellow, it sits right next to Titanium Black, Gray, and Violet colorways.</li><li>The new Ultra model starts at $1299 for the base 256GB of RAM.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we are looking forward to the next foldables from Samsung, the company, meanwhile, just slipped in a new colorway for its flagship Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Ultra already has a notable amount of colors in the lineup, including the Titanium Black, Gray, and Violet colorways, which are sold online and offline. Then, there are exclusive online colors like Titanium green, blue, and orange. Adding to the vibrant color portfolio, Samsung is now introducing the Titanium Yellow color option to the lineup.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UXKHBvYjGx8499nyBtboHW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Titanium-Colorways.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra in Titanium Yellow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UXKHBvYjGx8499nyBtboHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8TVyJHOjGE/?img_index=1">teasing</a> about the new colorway since early this week, the company finally made it official today (Jun. 21). At first glance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in new Titanium Yellow looks a lot more familiar to the Amber Yellow from its siblings, the Galaxy S24 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>. The former looks darker and more vibrant than the latter models.</p><p>It isn&apos;t the first time Samsung has added new colors to its flagship phone, and it has also been a trend with past models. For instance, the predecessor model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>, was introduced in two new colors, red and blue, on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SamsungIndia/status/1671439255749402625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1671439255749402625%7Ctwgr%5Eb34b6e5715343932aa4aaf19b0bd79906a6dfde4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeebom.com%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-new-colors-india%2F">same date</a> last year.</p>

<p>As for the yellow colorways, OEMs are seen experimenting with new, vibrant colors for their premium handsets. Apple introduced bright yellow for the iPhone 14 Plus last year, and OnePlus followed the same with its Nord series. On the other hand, Pixel has been pushing the blue hue for its Pixel phones like the Pixel 7a, Pixel 8 series, and Pixel 8a.</p><p>Nonetheless, adding a new color to a premium handset six months after the launch would surely jog one&apos;s memory and could regain interest in the flagship. However, Samsung is bringing it right before the Galaxy foldables: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s launch is intriguing.</p><p>Those interested in purchasing the new Titanium Yellow colorway of the flagship would have to shell out $1299 for the 256GB variant, $1419 for the 512GB variant, and $1659 for the larger 1TB variant.

<ul><li>Peak Design launched a new lineup of travel accessories, including a Small Tech Pouch.</li><li>This new carrying case is a smaller version of the standard Tech Pouch, making it a great way to store mobile accessories while on the go. </li><li>After using the Small Tech Pouch for a few weeks now, it’s my favorite accessory organizer yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Peak Design has been making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/peak-design-travel-tripod-review">quality camera gear</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/peak-design-android-magsafe-accessories">mobile accessories</a> for years, and there’s a new product that might be a good fit for Android power users. It’s called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.peakdesign.com/products/small-tech-pouch/" target="_blank">Small Tech Pouch</a>, and it’s a smaller version of the regular Tech Pouch, measuring about half the size of the original. It retails for $50 and comes in four colors: black, charcoal, midnight, and sage.</p><p>The release of the Small Tech Pouch, which just became available starting June 20, lined up with a new lineup of travel accessories from Peak Design. That includes the Travel Duffel 50L, Travel Duffel 80L, Packable Tote, and Ultralight Packing Cubes. I’ve been testing all of them for about a month, and surprisingly, it’s the Small Tech Pouch that I can’t stop using. It holds a lot more than its looks would suggest, and I fit all the Android accessories I need on a daily basis inside with no issues whatsoever. </p><p>Before using the Small Tech Pouch, I used the Native Union Stow carrying case and accessory organizer for well over a year. It fit the aesthetic I was looking for and held a fair bit of items, but I actually had to buy two of them to carry everything I needed for trips. There were a few other things I wasn’t a huge fan of, like zipper pockets that restricted what you could put inside them, an over-reliance on elastic straps, and a lack of rigidity when the carrying case was empty. </p>

<p>To be fair, the Small Tech Pouch doesn’t solve all these problems. Some of the case’s small-but-stretchy compartments still limit what you can put inside them. But what Peak Design got right is the rigid design that holds its shape even when the organizer is empty. That allows you to stuff things that don’t quite fit in the small compartments in the empty space in the middle of the Small Tech Pouch. Sometimes  less is more when it comes to pre-sized compartments, and it looks like Peak Design understood that.</p><p>The company added something that I haven’t seen before on an accessory organizer to the Small Tech Pouch. There are two small loops on each end of the pouch that allow you to wear it as a crossbody bag. It’s something I didn’t know I needed until I tried it. Instead of taking everything out of your accessory organizer and moving it all over to a fanny pack or crossbody, simply clicking on a strap to the Small Tech Pouch provides a similar experience.</p><p>That just about sums up why, as a power user that carries a lot of tech and accessories on a daily basis, an accessory organizer is a must-have for me. Most backpacks or tech bags have places you could put all your accessories inside without needing a dedicated pouch. But with an accessory organizer, you can move all your essentials across different bags without any stress. Everything is always stored in one place, so it’s always there when you need it. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AaRhdcyxpKEBAVqtj3QoxC" name="Peak-Design-Small-Tech-Pouch-10.jpg" alt="A spread of everything I fit inside the Peak Design Small Tech Pouch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AaRhdcyxpKEBAVqtj3QoxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised how much the Small Tech Pouch can fit despite its 1L capacity limit. I couldn’t fill it up, at least not without going overboard just for the sake of doing so. You can see everything I fit inside the Small Tech Pouch in the image above, but here’s a quick rundown:</p>
<ul><li>Two Ugreen power adapters</li><li>Two pairs of Beats Solo Buds </li><li>Ugreen USB-C hub</li><li>SD card reader and storage case </li><li>Microfiber cloth</li><li>USB-C to USB-C cable</li><li>USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable</li><li>USB-C to Apple Watch cable</li><li>Peak Design Cuff camera strap</li></ul>
<p>That’s everything I need for work on a daily basis and then some. On some days, I stuffed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/review-ugreen-145w-25000mah-power-bank-review">Ugreen’s massive 145W, 25,000 mAh power bank</a> in there as well. I’m sure someone will find a way to fill up the Small Tech Pouch with their everyday carry, but mine is fairly robust and I didn’t come close.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="msgv8fj2ppEn2dWk9Ss8UD" name="Peak-Design-Small-Tech-Pouch-9.jpg" alt="The logo on the inside of the Peak Design Small Tech Pouch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/msgv8fj2ppEn2dWk9Ss8UD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the name suggests, this pouch still does remain compact. I tested it in a variety of backpacks and messenger bags, from the lightweight Incase Facet 20L backpack, to the Peak Design Everyday Messenger, to the spacious LTT backpack. You should be able to fit the Small Tech Pouch in most bags, and if you can’t, you can turn the pouch into a bag of its own with the loops. It’s this kind of versatility that makes Peak Design’s new accessory organizer stand out.</p><p>So, should you buy it? With a price tag of $50, you’ll want to make sure you have a need for it before you make the purchase. I think it’s worth the price, but I’m someone who values being able to store a variety of tech accessories in one place. My rule of thumb is that accessories are only useful if you have them with you when you need them. It’s simple, but I’m sure we all remember a time when we wish we had headphones or a charger with us. </p><p>The Peak Design Small Tech Pouch does a better job of storing my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories">favorite Android accessories</a> in a compact form factor, even besting the Native Union Stow organizer I used for over a year. That’s appealing to me, and if it sounds valuable to you, the Small Tech Pouch will likely be a worthy buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has come up with a new battery, which will be seen in the upcoming phones from the company, and it aims to revolutionize smartphones shortly. It is dubbed the OnePlus Glacier battery and has a whopping 6100mAh capacity.</p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/3871046669?layerid=5047343858583450">Glacier battery</a> is built upon the company&apos;s "silicon carbon anode" battery technology, co-developed by OnePlus and Ningde New Energy. It is believed to be specially designed for high-performance phones and is acclaimed for users&apos; charging habits by providing at least two days of battery life on a single charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.81%;"><img id="JR2f9CL2KnCYBwzynPu6EM" name="OnePlus-Glacier-Battery-01.jpg" alt="OnePlus Glacier Battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JR2f9CL2KnCYBwzynPu6EM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="323" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the Glacier battery is stated to have its own set of benefits, like a quick charge of five minutes, which can give users a two-hour gameplay or is equivalent to browsing three and half hours of watching TikTok.</p><p>Another exciting element of the new battery capacity is the ability to support OnePlus&apos;s 100W super fast charge tech, which can be topped up by 1% to 100% in just 36 minutes. The further notable element of the new technology is that battery health is promised to retain its maximum health for up to 80% even after four years of usage.</p>

<p>Despite a large 6100mAh battery capacity, it is conveyed to be smaller than the conventional 5000mAh batteries found in most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> — all thanks "to "high-capacity bionic silicon carbon material" utilized in the making process of the Glacier battery. It also uses an ultra-high energy density of 763Wh/L, which is "23.1% higher than that of ordinary graphite batteries."</p><p>OnePlus phones are known for their large battery capacities, especially with the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, which already feature 5400mAh and 5500mAh batteries, respectively. They also turned out to be quite outstanding in our Android Central reviews.</p>

<p>The same company bringing a new battery tech accompanied by fast charging is an encouraging aspect to look forward to, particularly with the future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>.</p><p>Speaking of OnePlus, the company has started teasing its next Ace 3 Pro handset, which is all set to launch in China by the end of the month. During the Glacier battery launch, the company confirmed that the upcoming Ace 3 Pro will be the first handset from the company to equip the new 6100mAh battery tech, and it will also be powered by a Snapdragon 8 gen series chip. The device&apos;s sibling, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3-unveiled-in-china">OnePlus Ace 3</a>, has also seen its launch very recently.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s Pixel phones have long reigned as the top camera phones, thanks to impressive computational photography. With some cool software tricks, the company is able to add a level of depth and more natural bokeh, giving images an almost DSLR-like quality. That said, with the new Honor 200 Pro, the Pixel may finally have its work cut out for it when it comes to portrait images.</p><p>Honor&apos;s latest camera-centric phone is not quite a premium flagship, but it&apos;s close enough, bringing specs that rival the latest Pixel 8 Pro. But where things get really interesting is how the phone handles photos, taking almost the opposite approach to most other phones.</p><p>So how do these phones stack up overall? In this Honor 200 Pro vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro guide, we&apos;ll put them side by side to give you an idea so you can decide which phone you prefer.</p>
<h2 id="honor-200-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-design-and-display-2">Honor 200 Pro vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="kpJtWvoRNgdU5Eu7LtE6s" name="Honor-200-Pro-vs-Google-Pixel-8-Pro-1.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro next to the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpJtWvoRNgdU5Eu7LtE6s.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design philosophy of both phones is very different. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a> has a very artistic design, which is obvious from both sides of the device. The phone features a very distinct glass back panel, which differs based on the color you get. The Ocean Cyan is one of the more interesting hues, which teeters somewhere between green and blue. It also features a dual-texture design, with part of the panel adopting a smooth matte-like finish while the majority of it has a textured look and feel.</p><p>Honor follows through with the more artistic design of the camera housing, which was inspired by the rather unique shape found at Casa Mila in Barcelona. The combination of these unique design choices results in a phone that is rather eye-catching and is bound to turn heads.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google retained the Pixel&apos;s iconic camera visor on the back with a rather shiny aluminum that wraps around the frame of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. However, the back is a matte glass with a very soft feel, adding a dramatic contrast to the overall design. The back panel also slightly curves into the frame, which itself is also slightly rounded.</p>

<p>On the front, the phone has a flat display with fairly minimal bezels. This is in stark contrast to the quad-curved screen on the Honor 200 Pro, which seamlessly curves into the plastic frame, mirroring the curvature of the back panel. This makes the phone appear even thinner than it actually is. The Pixel 8 Pro is 0.6mm thicker than the Honor, but it looks even thicker when the phones are placed side-by-side. The Pixel is also slightly heavier, but it&apos;s hardly noticeable.</p><p>Both phones have 120Hz OLED panels, and both are quite bright. Honor has the Pixel beat, however, thanks to the much higher 4,000 nits of peak brightness. Honor also took extra care to ensure the display was as comfortable as possible for users. That includes a high 3,840Hz PWM dimming rate—which is ideal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> users, AI enhancements, TÜV Rheinland certifications, and other features that promote eye comfort.</p><p>Both displays are quite vibrant and sharp, but Honor takes the lead here despite the Pixel&apos;s higher pixel density. That goes for the design, too, which is much more inspired than the Pixel&apos;s, although the IP65 rating is noticeably weaker than the IP68 on the Pixel 8 Pro.</p>
<h2 id="honor-200-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">Honor 200 Pro vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4214px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ff8SNx6g5VZoH36QPkFkBS" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-15.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro face down on a desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ff8SNx6g5VZoH36QPkFkBS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4214" height="2370" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not just the outside that separates these phones. Internally, the Honor 200 Pro is a bit of a half-step down from phones running the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> inside still features many of the same AI capabilities and can keep up with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. Meanwhile, the Tensor G3 in the Pixel 8 still uses last year&apos;s Cortex-X3 core, but even so, the phone excels at AI, thanks to the Tensor processing unit. That means you may not get the best performance in all scenarios, but the phone will handle AI features extremely well.</p><p>That said, both phones perform well overall, and while gaming performance isn&apos;t particularly a strength of either, the Pixel seems to do a little better (but not by much). Games like Honkai: Star Rail play fairly smoothly on the highest settings, but expect either phone to get quite warm.</p><p>Both phones also have 12GB of RAM, which is great for juggling apps.</p>

<p>One thing that both these phones get right is audio. The dual stereo speakers sound very full and deep, giving your music some needed depth. The Pixel 8 Pro can make voices sound a little echoey, but it&apos;s not too noticeable. The downside is that neither phone has a headphone jack.</p><p>On-display fingerprint sensors are pretty good on both phones, but the sensor on the Honor 200 Pro is a bit faster, unlocking the phone almost as soon as I place my finger on the display. The Pixel 8 Pro takes about half a second. The downside of the Honor sensor is that it&apos;s incredibly low on the display compared to the more comfortable placement on the Pixel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3644px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bz3pDA7S6YeTSRxBJJwjBX" name="Honor-200-Pro-IR-blaster.jpg" alt="The IR blaster on the Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bz3pDA7S6YeTSRxBJJwjBX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3644" height="2050" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These phones also have little extras that you may or may not find useful. For the Honor 200 Pro, there&apos;s an IR blaster that you can use for the Smart Remote feature. I use it with my Chromecast with Google TV dongle connected to my Vizio TV, and it works very well. For the Pixel 8 Pro, there&apos;s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-google-pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor">temperature sensor</a> on the back, which you can use to measure... things as well as people. It feels a bit superfluous as more smartwatches adopt temperature sensors, and probably would&apos;ve been more useful during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but better late than never, I suppose.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i4u2SnVVy7H5kexy6pHq9a" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-temperature-sensor-measurement-01.jpg" alt="Testing the temperature sensor on the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4u2SnVVy7H5kexy6pHq9a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Neither phone is a battery champ, but this also depends on how you use either one. Power users may have trouble getting a full day&apos;s use, but the Honor 200 Pro has the benefit of 100W fast charging, which tops up the phone in less than an hour when you&apos;re low on juice. The Pixel only has 30W wired charging, which means you&apos;ll be waiting around for a full charge. The same goes for wireless charging, with the Honor hitting 66W and the Pixel only supporting 23W.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> on both phones feels very different. Honor&apos;s approach is much less big and bubbly than the Pixel UI, although I kind of prefer the former to the latter. However, some things may take some getting used to, like the separation of the notification panel and Control Center.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro has some interesting AI features, like the ability to drag and drop content between apps with the Magic Portal, the ability to extract and interact with text within images, and Air Gestures that let you control the phone without touching it. You also get access to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> if you want to switch away from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, and the Magic Capsule brings a Dynamic Island-like experience to the phone when you&apos;re listening to music or using a timer.</p><p>That said, if you want cool AI features, the Pixel 8 Pro has you covered with a plethora of them, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI Wallpapers</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, and more. Thanks to Gemini Nano integration, many features are available on-device, such as translating and transcribing texts.</p><p>Google also brings frequent updates for Pixel phones, with quarterly feature drops that add even more capabilities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qbhHWDX7WLZp5yipSYrEDG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-Video-Boost-processing.jpg" alt="Waiting for the Video Boost feature to process on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qbhHWDX7WLZp5yipSYrEDG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as software updates go, The Pixel also has Honor beat with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-8-pro-seven-android-os-updates-game-changer">seven years of OS upgrades</a> and software updates. That said, Honor promises three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which isn&apos;t bad and should be adequate for most people.</p>
<h2 id="honor-200-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-cameras-2">Honor 200 Pro vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ldt9XngFE9S6gPhUwagFXn" name="Honor-200-Pro-vs-Google-Pixel-8-Pro-2.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro next to the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ldt9XngFE9S6gPhUwagFXn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As stated before, the approach to the cameras is very different between these phones. Both have 50MP primary cameras and strong ultrawide and telephoto lenses (2.5x optical zoom on the Honor 200 Pro versus 5x on the Pixel 8 Pro). The Pixel 8 Pro often excels at adding depth and contrast to images while ensuring they remain sharp and detailed. The Pixel also tends to brighten up darker areas and shadows, giving you as much dynamic range as possible.</p><p>When shooting normally, the Honor 200 Pro seemingly does the opposite of the Pixel in many scenarios, whether it&apos;s leaning more into the shadowy parts of an image or brightening highlights with a surprising amount of dynamic range. This can often cause images to appear darker and with much more contrast than a Pixel, but they can also appear brighter in some areas. Images are also often warmer on the Honor than those taken on the Pixel.</p><p>From the images below, you can see the differences in how these phones process photos.</p>

<p>Where things get interesting, obviously, is in Portrait mode. The Honor lets you choose between three different styles: Harcourt Classic, Harcourt Color, and Harcourt Vibrant. All have a very different effect on the resulting image, but the latter option is probably closest to what a Pixel produces but with colors punched up a bit. With Classic and Color styles, Honor tends to make its Portrait images much more dramatic by simultaneously emphasizing shadows and brightening highlights, while the Pixel tries to make everything as bright as possible, including the background.</p>

<p>If you live in North America, then this might be an easy question to answer since the Honor 200 Pro isn&apos;t sold here. However, elsewhere in the world, the choice comes down to features and your preference when it comes to camera output.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro is a gorgeous phone with some great specs and a few compromises. The camera system is geared toward anyone who prefers taking photos of people, although Portrait mode works well with just about anything. You&apos;ll just have to be okay with darker shadows and higher-contrast images. Elsewhere, the fast charging and PWM-friendly display give the Honor an edge over the Pixel.</p><p>As for the Pixel 8 Pro, images won&apos;t come out as stylistic as they will on the Honor, but they&apos;ll be consistently good. You&apos;ll also have access to the best AI features out the gate and an impressive software update promise. That said, the Honor 200 Pro costs quite a bit less than the Pixel 8 Pro, which is also worth considering.</p><p>You can&apos;t go wrong with either phone in my opinion, but for most people, the Pixel 8 Pro is probably the way to go.</p>

<p>Do you remember the old "Does it Blend" YouTube videos? Well, I&apos;ve kind of adopted a similar mindset, but instead of destroying things, I try to install emulators on <em>almost</em> anything. This includes the obvious things like phones, tablets, and, of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve become infatuated with expanding my emulation experiments into various streaming devices. The latest of which came courtesy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review">Onn. Google TV 4K Pro</a>, my new favorite Android-based streaming device. That said, I&apos;ve also done similar setups with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> and, more recently, the latest Apple TV 4K.</p><p>I think part of the reason why I&apos;ve ventured down this path is because I&apos;m a tinkerer at heart. It&apos;s one thing to be able to install an app, transfer some games, and start playing. But the process isn&apos;t <em>quite</em> as simple when it comes to trying to use emulators on streaming devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pNCuL3sTXcmrBaKtLmP49d" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-totk-alt.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra playing Tears of the Kingdom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pNCuL3sTXcmrBaKtLmP49d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8064" height="4536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, it&apos;s absolutely wild that we&apos;re able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">play Switch games</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, which is another can of worms that I&apos;ll open another day. But it&apos;s also awesome being able to lay back on the couch and fire up some Super Mario 64 or play Link&apos;s Awakening on the big screen. All while doing so from either a box or a stick that&apos;s a fraction of the size of the original console.</p><p>Anyways, as I mentioned before, the process for getting things up and running isn&apos;t as simple on streaming devices. Even with the Play Store at our disposal on Google TV, the most recent Play Store release isn&apos;t always the best way to play.</p><p>For instance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.retroarch">Play Store version of RetroArch</a> hasn&apos;t been updated since November 2021. At first glance, you might look at that and think "Well, the app is dead, where do I go now?" In reality, RetroArch is very much alive and well, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/">most recent stable version</a> being released in early June 2024 and nightly builds easily accessible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iq6uSnMaLCSJzyo4WyGk5B" name="retroarch-hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook.jpg" alt="RetroArch on HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iq6uSnMaLCSJzyo4WyGk5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of that, you&apos;ll actually want to download and sideload the app directly from the RetroArch website. Provided that you install a file manager and something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yablio.sendfilestotv">Send files to TV</a> app, you can have the latest version installed on your streaming device in relatively no time. Then comes the process of actually making games accessible, which isn&apos;t an easy task for the Fire TV Stick or Chromecast with Google TV.</p><p>This is because neither of those devices includes any additional ports besides the one used for charging. All hope isn&apos;t lost; it&apos;s just that you&apos;ll need to use either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromecast-google-tv-accessory-usb-c-hub">USB-C hub</a> or a micro USB OTG splitter. In doing so, you&apos;ll now be able to plug a USB drive in, after transferring your ROM files, of course.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="miif9Z7pE8XPzzxqN6PDw5" name="zelda-fire-tv-stick-4k-max.jpg" alt="Playing Zelda through an emulator on the Fire TV Stick 4K Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/miif9Z7pE8XPzzxqN6PDw5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3965" height="2230" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fun doesn&apos;t stop there; we&apos;re just getting started. There&apos;s a good chance that the majority of the retro games that you want to play will run just fine without any tinkering. However, because RetroArch takes a "one-size-fits-most" approach, there&apos;s more to it than just picking a game and being on your way.</p><p>If you try to play one of your favorite retro games, but you notice that performance is shoddy, you can choose a different RetroArch "Core." For the unaware, Cores are essentially barebones emulators that rely on RetroArch to act as the front end.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="tDvmcF4Loaj7FhMnYF4jSK" name="retroarch-core-updater.jpg" alt="RetroArch Core Updater" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDvmcF4Loaj7FhMnYF4jSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="809" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RetroArch)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An example of this is with the N64, as there are two different Cores built into the app. If you fire up Super Mario 64 and aren&apos;t happy with the performance, you can go back to the main RetroArch interface and switch to a different one. The same rings true for many other emulators, with only a few exceptions. It&apos;s very much a "trial and error" scenario, which is perfect for the tinkerers out there.</p><p>Of course, RetroArch isn&apos;t the only emulator that can be used on streaming devices; it&apos;s just the one that I&apos;d recommend starting with. RetroArch works with all kinds of retro consoles, ranging from the Atari 2600 all the way up to the PlayStation 2. Still, I&apos;d recommend staying away from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ps2-emulators-android-all-best-options-available">PS2 emulators</a> on streaming devices for now, at least until they get a bit more power.</p><p>So the next time that you have friends or family over and are trying to figure out something to do, grab a couple of controllers and fire up an emulator. You&apos;ll never forget the look of surprise when the original Super Smash Bros. appears on your TV, and you can enjoy those classics all over again. It&apos;s also how I plan to show my son some of the best retro games before he tries getting into Roblox and Fortnite and whatever else the kids play these days.</p>
