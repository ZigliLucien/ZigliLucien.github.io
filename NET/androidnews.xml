<ul><li>A new update sees the return of chat filters to WhatsApp beta.</li><li>Unlike previous tests, there are only three filters this time – All, Unread, and Groups.</li><li>This feature is currently only available to some beta testers, but it is expected to be rolled out to more users in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has introduced a new beta feature that reintroduces chat filters to the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>. It’s not the first time chat filters have appeared in a beta version of the app.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-6-16-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-beta-android-chat-filters-unread-groups/">Android Police</a>), the latest beta update – version 2.24.6.16 – is rolling out a feature that allows users to filter chats. This version of the chat filter feature offers three filtering options: All, Unread, and Groups. The new filters are positioned as a new row of lozenge-shaped buttons at the top of the screen, just below the top app bar. </p><p>Perhaps significantly, there is no contacts filter on this feature version. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-14-17-whats-new/">Last July</a>, a previous beta test took place, and there were additional filters, including Personal and Business. In September, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-19-7-whats-new/">another beta update</a> saw these two filters renamed as Contacts and Groups. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Athwgs3yYdhrxmGFKBufCR" name="whatsApp beta chat filters.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the chat filters in the latest WhatsApp beta update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Athwgs3yYdhrxmGFKBufCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s unclear why the contacts filter has been removed, but it is likely to be based on user feedback. In theory, chat filters will enable users to find specific conversations more quickly and easily, improving the user experience as a result.    </p><p>While WhatsApp is relatively simple to use, anyone who has many conversations on the go will have experienced the challenge of trying to find a specific chat. Allowing users to filter for unread messages or group chats could make it a lot easier to locate and access specific messages.</p>
<p>According to WABetaInfo, this feature is currently available to just a few beta testers, but the expectation is that it will become available to more users “over the coming weeks.”</p><p>We’ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-web-favorites-in-development">previously reported</a> that WhatsApp web is working on a favorites feature, as well as similar developments on the iOS version of WhatsApp. This suggests that chat filters could be a prominent part of future planned updates to the stable version of WhatsApp.</p>

I have incredibly fond memories of the early days of modern consumer VR — specifically with the HTC Vive — and its SteamVR-powered experience. I&apos;ve spent hundreds of hours in PC-only headsets over the years, and while all of them used different tracking methods, controllers, displays, and other components, all of them have been peppered with the exact same problems: they require as many hours of troubleshooting as you&apos;ll plan to play on them.</p>

<p>It&apos;s more than likely that I&apos;m cursed in some regard to PC gaming, but I&apos;ve never had an easy time of the effort. I&apos;m aware of the flak I&apos;m going to receive from the hardcore community for this article, but I know I&apos;m not alone in my struggles. PC gaming seldom works for me and, even when it does, the trade-offs are almost often never worth the effort that goes into making it work.</p><p>This past week, Meta relaunched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/meta-quest-link-improvements/">Meta Quest Link software</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, Quest Pro, and Quest 2, and it made me wonder if the new improvements would be a notable improvement on my historically bad experience.</p><p>Turns out, it wasn&apos;t.</p>

<p>I come from an IT background of 15 years where I spent time as both a help desk technician and a systems administrator. I&apos;m extremely familiar with computers, the individual components, and have been since I was a kid. I built my first computer from scratch when I was 12 and was an avid PC gamer for most of my life.</p><p>But the years of tweaking and troubleshooting have grown on my nerves. Things were never worse than when I was knee-deep in the PCVR scene with the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift S, two PC headsets that I loved but didn&apos;t love me back. I can recall spending an hour troubleshooting audio problems nearly every night when my wife and I would play Beat Saber, and the problems never got better as the headsets improved.</p><p>Today, PCVR has the potential to be more effortless than ever. Realistically, all you need is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5841245619310585">Steam Link app</a> on your Meta Quest headset, and you can wirelessly play PCVR games with almost no setup. That is, so long as you have one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wifi-6-routers">best routers</a> that&apos;s capable of delivering low latency and high bandwidth between your PC and Quest.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Somehow, even a wired PCVR experience will fail me when it should be the simplest method to use.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, for me, my old Wi-Fi 6 mesh router stopped working and I&apos;m using an older router with less-than-adequate wireless speeds for PCVR use. That means I&apos;ve got to wire up my headset like it was 2016 if I want to play PCVR games.</p><p>Simple enough, you say. Just plug the thing in and launch the Quest Link app, right? I wish.</p><p>Over the weekend, I jumped into the latest beta of Contractors Showdown to see how different the game looked on PC versus the native Quest version. There are some marked differences between the two, but I was surprised by how soft the image was compared to the native Quest version.</p><p>I tweaked some settings but could never get rid of that telltale "compressed" look. It was a good enough experience, but I was left at least a little disappointed by the result. Still, it worked well enough... that is, until the next day when I went to play another round with some friends.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZdwFzQwVwjB5y7MivpnUfG" name="Meta-quest-3-pc-link-cable-03.jpg" alt="The Meta Quest 3 sitting on top of a PC with a Link cable attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZdwFzQwVwjB5y7MivpnUfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I plugged the cable in and heard the good old "da dunk" connection sound Windows makes when something gets plugged in and recognized. Except the Quest Link software said the headset wasn&apos;t connected. I then put the Quest on, clicked the Quest Link button on the dashboard, and it said no PC found.</p><p>So I did what any self-respecting IT expert would do: I turned it off and on again.</p><p>Then I unplugged it, left it off for 20 seconds, and plugged it back in again. Wash, rinse, repeat. I even tried <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Kuject-Transfer-Charging-Chargers/dp/B08MZFS4SY/">another cable</a> since I&apos;ve got two or three lying around, but the PC refused to recognize my connected headset.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Gaming on a Quest is so much more effortless than any other way to VR.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Ironically, Air Link worked immediately when I clicked the toggle in the headset, but I quickly remembered why I could not play this way. The latency between my movements and the in-game character&apos;s movements made the game completely unplayable. And the fact that a VHS tape delivered better quality than my wireless streaming setup didn&apos;t help things.</p><p>Instead, I unplugged everything and started up the native Contractors Showdown game running on the Quest itself. Guess what? <strong>It worked.</strong></p><p>It always works when it&apos;s on Quest — aside from a scant few hiccups here and there — and that&apos;s part of why I love the Quest experience so much. It&apos;s a console. You put it on your head and play. It&apos;s <em>the</em> thing that immediately sold me on Quest when I used the original unit back in 2019 and why I almost never use any other headset to play VR games.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I fully recognize the advantages PCVR games could have. I just wish the tech would work for me.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve written off PCVR more times than I can count, so why do I still seem to come back for more? The answer is that I fully recognize the serious advantages PCVR games could potentially have over Quest games.</p><p>Better graphics are just the start. Many SteamVR games are Steam Workshop enabled and can be easily modded. Half-Life: Alyx is a deal not just because of Valve&apos;s masterful storytelling but also because the modding community has produced some truly brilliant works of art with it.</p><p>But I rarely experience this because PCVR doesn&apos;t work for me on a technical level. No matter what I do, and no matter how hard I try, things never seem to get better. At the very least, even if I can get it working once, I seldom repeat the experience two days in a row. And, for that, I may very well be writing off PCVR forever.</p><p>Anyone want to buy a PC? I might be selling one.</p>

<ul><li>Google has enhanced security for Chrome's Safe Browsing feature, providing real-time protection against phishing for all users, regardless of their protection mode.</li><li>The security update is available for Chrome on desktop and iOS, with plans for an Android release later this month.</li><li>Additionally, Password Checkup on iOS has been upgraded to flag weak and reused passwords.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today that it has beefed up security for the <em>Standard</em> protection mode in Chrome&apos;s <em>Safe Browsing</em> feature. Now, everyone gets real-time protection against phishing and malware attacks.</p><p>Even with all the safety tools available to consumers, the internet isn&apos;t exactly becoming safer. To tackle this, Google upgraded Chrome&apos;s protection system, Safe Browsing, last year, adding real-time protection to the mix.</p><p>This feature, which was previously only available in Safe Browsing&apos;s <em>Enhanced Protection</em> mode, keeps an eye on the URLs you&apos;re browsing and instantly warns you if you wander into a sketchy part of the internet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.80%;"><img id="uxaXAG7iQsu5nAbKri69U6" name="google-chrome-phishing warning.jpg" alt="Google Chrome security feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxaXAG7iQsu5nAbKri69U6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="678" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is now up and running for anyone using Chrome on desktop or iOS. Google also plans to bring it to Android users later this month.</p><p>As you browse the web, Chrome will scan if the webpage you&apos;re on matches any malicious URLs in a local list. If it finds a match, it&apos;ll block the site and show a warning. However, Google found out that 60% of these sneaky domains are only active for less than ten minutes before they vanish.</p><p>This means that keeping an updated list of risky domains is less helpful. Since the list is stored locally, it can&apos;t shield you from new sites detected since the last update.</p><p>Google&apos;s fix involves live monitoring, where it constantly checks against Google&apos;s cloud database in real time to decide if a site is dangerous and needs to be blocked. According to Google, this method boosts protection from phishing and malware by 25%. Plus, it leans on AI to classify malicious URLs and web pages.</p><p>While live monitoring is now turned on by default in the Standard Protection mode, not everyone might be comfortable with Google scanning every URL you visit and every file you download.</p><p>To tackle privacy worries, Google is rolling out real-time protection in a way that preserves privacy through Fastly&apos;s Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) privacy server. This protocol sends partially hashed URLs to Google&apos;s Safe Browsing engine without revealing users&apos; private details such as IP addresses.</p>

<p>Apart from beefing up Chrome&apos;s security, Google also mentions that an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-password-manager-gains-new-desktop-features">upgraded Password Checkup feature for iOS</a> is now live. Now, besides identifying compromised passwords, it will also flag weak and reused passwords.</p><p>Chrome will pop up an alert whenever it spots a problem with a password you&apos;ve entered. But if you want to double-check your passwords anytime, just head over to Safety Check in Chrome Settings.</p>

<hr>
<p>Blink has debuted its latest Mini 2 plug-in camera, which is available today (Mar. 14) and starts at $39.99 in the U.S.</p><p>According to a press release, Blink states it has redesigned its next-generation Mini 2 security camera, beginning with its new custom chip. This chip is said to bring one of the Mini 2&apos;s key features: person detection. The camera features CV-enabled person detection through a Blink subscription, which should help trim down on false alarms if an animal walks by it.</p><p>The Blink Mini 2 has also been upgraded with improved image quality and low-light performance when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blink-mini-vs-blink-indoor">initial iteration</a>. The latest security camera offers a wider FoV (field of view) and a built-in LED spotlight that lets users peer through the camera in full color.</p><p>Privacy was another aspect Blink honed in on, stating its customers will have "complete control of their privacy settings." The company&apos;s official app will be users&apos; gateway to these settings as they customize activity zones and privacy parameters. </p><p>Regarding the former, Blink states users can set their Mini 2 to record areas they find important and do away with spots that don&apos;t matter, like public walkways.</p><p>The Mini 2 continues to feature a two-way speaker, much like the original Mini. Additionally, Blink states image processing captured by the camera takes place on your device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6S2aqu8TemFEeif9xdjWz5" name="blink-mini-2-black-nighttime-photo.jpg" alt="The Blink Mini 2 in a black colorway on a house at night." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6S2aqu8TemFEeif9xdjWz5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Blink)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Blink&apos;s Mini has always been compact, however, the company is refreshing it with a sleeker design for the sequel. The Mini 2 is stated to retain the same size (2" x 1.9" x 1.4") but has been outfitted with a weather-resistant power adapter for outdoor use.</p><p>The Mini 2 features some AI, as the press release adds that the camera works well with Amazon&apos;s Alexa. Using the "Alexa Blink Smarthome Skills," users can connect an Echo device to their Mini 2. Doing so will deliver important home security alerts, an option to check your camera&apos;s live feed, and arming and disarming commands.</p><p>Customers who&apos;ve purchased a Mini 2 will have access to its core features, but those looking to take it further will need a subscription. Grabbing a plan will provide homeowners with the Mini 2&apos;s person detection feature, cloud video recording, rapid video playback access, and 60 days of unlimited video history.</p><p>Blink states its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.blinkforhome.com/en_US/plan-management/purchasing-a-blink-subscription-plan-through-amazon">subscription plans</a> begin at $3 a month or $30 for a year.</p><p>Consumers can grab the Blink Mini 2 today (Mar. 14), starting at $39.99 in the U.S. for indoor use. Those interested in Canada will find it starting at CAD 54.99. If you&apos;re taking it outside and want the weather-resistant adapter, those prices will jump to $49.98 and CAD 69.98, respectively.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>ASUS pivoted to making small phones two years ago, and that strategy worked out pretty well for the brand. At a time when other brands started focusing on bigger devices, the Zenfone series served as the de facto choice for those who wanted a small phone with high-end hardware. </p><p>But the brand still has a sizeable userbase that wants a large phone, and it&apos;s now catering to those users with the introduction of the Zenfone 11 Ultra — which has a 6.78-inch screen while retaining the best features of previous Zenfone devices.</p><p>What it doesn&apos;t have is any design similarity to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">Zenfone 9</a>; if anything, the phone looks nearly identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8</a>, and the USB-C port at the bottom isn&apos;t centered. Clearly, ASUS is using the same foundation for both phones, and I don&apos;t have a problem with that.</p><p>While ASUS hasn&apos;t confirmed the existence of a smaller Zenfone, the naming convention suggests we should see a standard Zenfone 11 model that&apos;s based on a smaller chassis — similar to the last two years. Considering the launch window of the Zenfone 11 Ultra, we should see the regular model debut sometime in the summer.</p><p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra shares the same great feature-set as its predecessors, but it has the same foibles: the phone will only get two platform updates, and that is nowhere close to being enough in 2024. However, there&apos;s a distinct lack of Android phones with clean software and good customizability, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra slots into that segment with effortless ease.</p><p>ASUS is also betting big on AI, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra has a slate of useful features that make a difference. I used the Zenfone 11 Ultra as my daily driver for two weeks, and here&apos;s what I think of the device.</p>

<p>ASUS unveiled the Zenfone 11 Ultra on March 14, and the phone is now up for pre-order in select global markets. The base model has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and ASUS is also rolling out a 16GB/512GB version.</p><p>The 12GB/256GB model will be available for $899 in the U.S., €999 in most European countries, and £869 in the U.K. ASUS isn&apos;t launching the 16GB/512GB model in the U.S. at the moment, but it will debut at €1,099 in Europe and £949 in the U.K.</p><p>ASUS has pre-order offers running from March 14 to April 14 that bring the cost of the 12GB/256GB model down to €899 in Europe and £819 in the U.K., and the 16GB/512GB to €999 and £869. ASUS will sell the device via its website as well as Amazon, and local partners in select regions.</p><p>ASUS isn&apos;t discounting the device in the U.S., but will bundle its Cetra earbuds with all pre-orders. The Zenfone 11 Ultra will be sold via ASUS&apos;s website in the U.S., and the brand&apos;s regional partner Mobile Advance will sell the device on Amazon.</p>

<p>ASUS is switching things up with the Zenfone 11 Ultra, and the matte texture with oversized cameras that were a chief design characteristic of the last two years is making way for a cleaner look. The Zenfone 11 Ultra instead has a silky finish at the back, and the design is based on ASUS&apos;s anniversary logo monogram.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AisvLhuZpEv5AmBZEbsyrP" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-6.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AisvLhuZpEv5AmBZEbsyrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The minimal design looks good, but it doesn&apos;t quite have the same great in-hand feel as the Zenfone 9 or Zenfone 10. The phone is available in four color variants — white, black, blue, and peach — but the color is limited to the back, with the sides decked out in black on all four models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AYz5sMp7xiX5oRVkVrcd2Q" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-7.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYz5sMp7xiX5oRVkVrcd2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera module is also in the same black hue across all color variants, and it makes the device look decidedly budget. Most flagship phones have elegant designs with standout colors, and I can&apos;t help but feel that the Zenfone 11 Ultra comes across as plain. ASUS should have matched the sides to the colors at the back, and used a design that has a bit more character; as it stands, the camera island at the back is purely functional with no thought given to aesthetics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-12.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given just how similar the phone is to the ROG Phone 8, ASUS wanted to reuse the same foundation without making too many changes. This saves a ton of costs during manufacturing, so I understand the brand&apos;s reason for doing so. However, the ROG Phone 8 has a distinct visual identity, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra misses out in that area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sdEeBQ3jgspSVCj4h7aBAQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-8.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sdEeBQ3jgspSVCj4h7aBAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design doesn&apos;t really stand out, ASUS is using high-quality materials throughout. The mid-frame is made out of recycled aluminum, the back curves slightly as it meets the sides, so you can easily hold the device, and even though this is a tall and heavy phone, ASUS nailed the weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ERZRAdxNTStT5xF9GKNqpQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-13.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERZRAdxNTStT5xF9GKNqpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island is positioned in such a way that there&apos;s no wobble when using the device on a table. ASUS always offered a 3.5mm jack on its Zenfone series, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra doesn&apos;t miss out in this area — you get the analog jack at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNzyhQ6dKVVBx37E7k7BgQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-14.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNzyhQ6dKVVBx37E7k7BgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because the phone is a rebadged ROG Phone 8, the USB-C port isn&apos;t centered; it sits to the left at the bottom, with the SIM card tray moved to the middle. The reason for this is so that the charging cable doesn&apos;t get in the way when you&apos;re playing a game while charging the phone, but it just looks weird on the Zenfone 11 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zFuYDY3n9RLwxTzZLaiRRQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-10.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zFuYDY3n9RLwxTzZLaiRRQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, there&apos;s no way to charge the device easily if you&apos;re like me and use a phone stand. ASUS should have paid more attention to these design considerations, because as it stands, the Zenfone 11 Ultra doesn&apos;t have much in the way of differentiation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sJryGJyAq9UZEowsr9T7HQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-9.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sJryGJyAq9UZEowsr9T7HQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But you still get IP68 dust and water resistance, and the pane of glass at the back is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The Zenfone 11 Ultra is good to hold and use, but the phone is positioned against flagships, and it just doesn&apos;t have the flair that&apos;s needed in this category. Basically, ASUS went from making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phone</a> to a device that doesn&apos;t quite have a distinct visual identity. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-11-ultra-display"><span>ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jAYTeVsEUgC4i2QhFoshqS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-17.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jAYTeVsEUgC4i2QhFoshqS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS says it got a lot of feedback over the last two years from Zenfone users that wanted a larger device, so the Zenfone 11 Ultra is catered to meet those needs. The phone has a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel, and it gets all the extras you&apos;d want in 2024: it has 120Hz refresh, the screen goes up to 2,500 nits in HDR content, and 1,600 nits in HBM mode. While those figures aren&apos;t as high as the Magic 6 Pro, the Zenfone 11 Ultra manages to get just as bright in daily use scenarios, and that&apos;s what ultimately matters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-22.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has LTPO tech as well, with the panel going down to 1Hz when viewing static content. ASUS tends to calibrate its panels on the cooler side, and that is the case with the Zenfone 11 Ultra as well. That said, you can easily change the color balance via the settings; there are four modes available, and you can use the Customized option to tweak colors to your liking.</p><p>You can set the screen refresh to Auto mode, or manually switch between 60Hz and 120Hz. There&apos;s a gaming mode that pushes the screen refresh to 144Hz, but there&apos;s no way to manually enable it, and it only activates in select titles.</p>
<p>The bezels are noticeably thinner than the Zenfone 10, and the selfie camera cutout is centered. ASUS always delivered good stereo sound on its phones, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra has powerful stereo speakers that are among the loudest in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s8WFocteBqfLisFVrzZ5NU" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-31.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s8WFocteBqfLisFVrzZ5NU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also get a 3.5mm jack, Dirac&apos;s Virtuo tuning in the AudioWizard control panel that makes a legitimate difference when playing games or streaming content — there&apos;s even a 10-band parametric EQ. ASUS is one of very few brands that offers the full AptX suite of audio codecs, so if you&apos;re using a pair of wireless earbuds, there&apos;s a good chance that you&apos;ll be able to stream high-res music.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42pa8sVXNtkYG9JEDDx3dR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-24.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42pa8sVXNtkYG9JEDDx3dR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS has its usual game turbo engine here, and it is among the best you&apos;ll find on any phone. A new addition this year is Video Genie, which is designed to minimize distractions when you&apos;re watching a video. You get the option to mute calls and notifications while a video is playing, and it is a nifty feature.</p>
<p>To round things off, you get an always-on mode, but the clock styles are fairly limited, and you don&apos;t get much in the way of customizability. Other than that, the Zenfone 11 Ultra ticks all the right boxes; the screen is large and vibrant, you get a lot of useful extras, and it is a delight to use for gaming and playing videos.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-11-ultra-hardware"><span>ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra: Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fk8vonKa4pPPFKCDx9GJVR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-19.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fk8vonKa4pPPFKCDx9GJVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS knows what it&apos;s doing when it comes to the hardware, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra has zero issues in this particular area. The device is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and you get 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage as standard. There&apos;s also a 16GB/512GB model if you need more storage, but there isn&apos;t a 1TB version.</p><p>Just like ASUS&apos;s gaming phones, there are no slowdowns whatsoever in daily use, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra is one of the fastest phones you can buy at the moment. ASUS did a terrific job optimizing the hardware with ZenUI, and it is fluid like no other device in this segment. However, I noticed a few instances where apps crashed at launch, but by and large, there are no problems in daily use.</p>
<p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra is terrific at gaming as well, and it delivers stable framerates in demanding titles with no issues. ASUS isn&apos;t throttling the chipset this time, so it tends to overheat during extended gaming sessions, but not to a point where it gets uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But in the Solar Bay stress test, the device got so hot that I wasn&apos;t able to hold it. It went up to 58 degrees, and that is second only to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Nubia Z60 Ultra</a>, which hit 60 degrees. Most 2024 phones I tested didn&apos;t go beyond 44 degrees, and while the Zenfone 11 Ultra gets noticeably hotter than its rivals, it doesn&apos;t go anywhere close to that 58-degree mark in regular use. Although it gets hot, there is no noticeable throttling while gaming, and the stability score of 77.1% in Solar Bay is one of the highest of any device. </p><p>There isn&apos;t anything missing on the connectivity front, with the Zenfone 11 Ultra featuring a modem that has Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 7, global Sub-6 5G bands, NFC, and dual-band GPS. ASUS did a good job with the haptic engine as well, and you get granular feedback while using the keyboard and navigating the interface.</p><p>Barring a few glitches that have been addressed in the latest software build, I didn&apos;t see any issues with the Zenfone 11 Ultra — ASUS once again delivered one of the best hardware packages in the segment. </p>

<p>ASUS took full advantage of the increased real estate, and fitted a 5500mAh battery inside the Zenfone 11 Ultra. The result is that the phone lasts up to two days with medium use, and I got a day and a half even with heavy use. Battery anxiety is largely nonexistent in 2024, but the Zenfone 11 Ultra has a distinct edge over its rivals, delivering at least an hour of additional screen-on-time.</p><p>The phone uses the standard USB PD 3.0 charging protocol, and charges at 65W. You even get wireless charging here, going up to 15W over the Qi 1.3 standard. But what&apos;s annoying is that there is no charger in the box; ASUS is emulating Samsung in this regard, and you&apos;ll need to buy a USB PD charger to use with the Zenfone 11 Ultra if you don&apos;t have one. This is a real shame considering the bundled ASUS chargers were particularly good at charging a variety of other products.</p>

<p>ASUS has steadily refined its cameras over the last two years, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra builds on this with a versatile package that includes three lenses. The main camera is a 50MP Sony IMX90 with a 6-axis gimbal stabilization system. The gimbal stabilizer makes a ton of difference when shooting videos, and I&apos;m glad that ASUS retained it this time around. While the IMX890 is showing its age, ASUS says it went with the module as it was easy to integrate with the gimbal stabilizer.</p><p>There&apos;s also a 13MP wide-angle lens with 120-degree field of view, and a new addition is a 32MP telephoto lens with OIS that does 3x optical zoom. The lens goes up to 30x digitally, but in my usage, I found that it delivered usable shots up to 5x. Up front, you&apos;ll find a 32MP module with 90-degree FoV that uses 4-to-1 pixel binning to deliver 8MP shots.</p>

<p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra takes stellar photos in daylight scenarios, with resultant shots offering great dynamic range and color accuracy. The camera tuning skews toward accurate color rendition, and while there is aggressive smoothening when it comes to foliage, the camera holds its own against other flagships.</p><p>The wide-angle lens is quite decent too, and it manages to deliver photos with the same color balance as the main lens. I was excited to try out the 3x zoom lens, and while it does a good job most of the time, there&apos;s still some work that needs to be done to tune the sensor.</p><p>You get detailed images in low-light scenarios as well, and ASUS was definitely able to eke the most out of the Sony sensor. There&apos;s some fringing at times and you miss out on details, but on the whole, the main camera is great in low-light situations. It takes a second to save photos to the gallery, but other than that, there isn&apos;t a lot that&apos;s wrong.</p><p>The auxiliary lenses are strictly average in challenging scenarios, and they just don&apos;t measure up to what other flagships offer. Another area where ASUS misses out is taking photos of fast-moving objects; it just isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the Pixels or the Find X7 Ultra in these situations.</p><p>The cameras are the best of any Zenfone I used thus far, and ASUS got a lot of things right in this area. That said, other brands raised the bar considerably in 2024, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> and Find X7 Ultra delivering huge gains. The Zenfone 11 Ultra just doesn&apos;t measure up against those devices, and it isn&apos;t on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in this regard.</p>

<p>I tested the Zenfone 11 Ultra with the 34.1420.1420.226 build, and this is the retail version that will be available on consumer devices. ASUS mentions that the build will be available as a day-one OTA update, so if you don&apos;t see all the software features out of the box, you&apos;ll need to update your phone.</p><p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra runs the latest iteration of ZenUI on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and ASUS is doing a great job with its UI efforts. The interface itself is clean and doesn&apos;t have any bloatware, and you can&apos;t say that about most phones in this segment — the Pixel 8 Pro is the only other device that comes to mind.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="my5KYm8a9P7ZVsCn7dxrKS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-18.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/my5KYm8a9P7ZVsCn7dxrKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like with ZenUI is that it gives you plenty of customizability across the board. The notification pane has three styles: ASUS Optimized is the usual option that switches to the older Android system, you can choose Stock Android that has large tiles similar to what you get on a Pixel, and there&apos;s a new mode that splits the notification pane in two — with toggles on one side, and notifications on the other.</p>
<p>The UI itself is fluid, and there are no issues in daily use. But the only issue is that ASUS is aggressive with memory management, and I had issues with push notifications at times. This was a problem last year as well, and while there is a setting to disable battery optimization individually, that doesn&apos;t do much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-21.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS is rolling out a suite of AI features with the device, and these include AI Call Translator, AI Transcript, AI Wallpaper, and AI Noise Cancellation. AI Call Translator is baked into the ASUS phone dialer, and it delivers real-time translations when you&apos;re talking to someone in another language.</p>
<p>You also get the ability to create unique backgrounds on the fly, but the feature I like the most is AI Transcript. It transcribes audio — when using the built-in sound recorder — and it does a brilliant job. I normally use a standalone recorder when conducting interviews, but I decided to just take the Zenfone 11 Ultra when talking to Nothing&apos;s co-founder, and it did a great job picking up audio and transcribing it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="va6rpjKAX9Ni3xxccUSqVS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-25.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/va6rpjKAX9Ni3xxccUSqVS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS says the recorder works in eight languages, and transcribing is done on-device — no data is sent to the cloud. There&apos;s a nifty summary mode that basically summaries the contents of the audio, and this feature relies on the cloud. ASUS introduced Semantic Search debuted on the Zenfone 10, and the feature is available here as well. It uses metadata and contextual information to surface images in the gallery and pull up relevant sub-menus in the settings.</p>
<p>ZenUI now has Phone Link built-in, and ASUS has its own GlideX control panel that lets you use your phone with your Windows machine. The Taiwanese manufacturer is also introducing Qualcomm Seamless; the feature isn&apos;t available just yet, but will go live later in the year, and it lets you seamlessly switch between your phone and Windows machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t66EQk5WgPM32DpCkJBZfS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-23.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t66EQk5WgPM32DpCkJBZfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main issue with ZenUI is software updates, or lack thereof. ASUS guarantees two Android platform updates with the Zenfone 11 Ultra, and four years of security updates. There&apos;s just no way this is adequate on a phone that costs $899 in 2024, and it severely limits the device.</p>
<p>ASUS maintains that it has limited engineering resources and it cannot deliver more than two updates, but there are brands like Nothing that have fewer resources but still guarantee three updates on budget phones like the Phone (2a), so ASUS doesn&apos;t have an excuse in this area. With Google and Samsung now offering seven updates and the rest of the field guaranteeing four platform updates, the Zenfone 11 Ultra is woefully behind.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bY6EqfMcMRRDGxEqr6Vv9S" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-26.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY6EqfMcMRRDGxEqr6Vv9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8 Pro is the obvious alternative to the Zenfone 11 Ultra, with Google also offering a clean interface that doesn&apos;t have any bloatware. The Pixel 8 Pro isn&apos;t as powerful, nor does it last as long. However, you get a much better camera system, seven years of software updates, and the design looks much better. As a flagship, the Pixel 8 Pro just has much more to offer.</p><p>If you want to maximize value, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is a good choice to consider. The software isn&apos;t anywhere as good as what you get on the Zenfone 11 Ultra, but you get powerful hardware, a gorgeous design, stellar battery life, and versatile cameras that take terrific photos.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-11-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EohEk4M9Mccoe7RoKhcuXT" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-28.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EohEk4M9Mccoe7RoKhcuXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a large phone with terrific hardware</li><li>You need a phone with the best battery life</li><li>You want clean software with plenty of useful features</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need long-term Android updates</li><li>You want flagship cameras</li><li>You need a charger in the box</li></ul>
<p>When you&apos;re paying $899 for a phone, you want the absolute best that&apos;s available. To its credit, ASUS got a lot right with the Zenfone 11 Ultra; the phone is one of the fastest around, the battery lasts longer than just about any other phone I used in 2024, and the clean software is a delight to use. You even get a few AI features that are actually meaningful, and ZenUI continues to be one of my favorite Android skins.</p><p>The cameras take better photos than previous ASUS phones as well, and it&apos;s good to see ASUS make good strides in this area. That said, they&apos;re still not quite on the same level as other flagships. The Pixel 8 Pro, Honor Magic 6 Pro, and even the OnePlus 12 outmatch the Zenfone 11 Ultra in most scenarios, and ASUS needs to do more if it wants to hold its own against other flagships.</p><p>But the biggest issue with the Zenfone 11 Ultra is that it will just get two software updates. That&apos;s not enough for a budget phone, much less a device that costs $899. Every other phone in this segment gives you at least twice as many updates, and while the Zenfone 11 Ultra clearly has a lot to offer, the pitiful update policy is ultimately a deal-breaker.</p>

Let&apos;s delve into the reasons behind this potential ban.</p>
<h2 id="the-quot-data-security-quot-argument-2">The "Data Security" argument</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VMwhQjhhccVMDDkifUPED7" name="Google-Pixel-6-pro-privacy-dashboard.jpg" alt="Pixel 6 Pro Privacy Dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VMwhQjhhccVMDDkifUPED7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The central fear revolves around user data. ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns TikTok; unfortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">that&apos;s the real problem</a>. U.S. lawmakers worry that the Chinese government could pressure ByteDance to hand over user data, potentially including location information, browsing habits, and even private messages. This data, they fear, could be used for espionage or to influence American public opinion, particularly during elections.</p><p>The U.S. has a tense relationship with China, and concerns about intellectual property theft and Chinese government influence are well-documented. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/national-intelligence-law-of-the-p-r-c-2017/">2017 Chinese law</a> compels companies to "support, cooperate with and provide assistance" with national intelligence work. This fuels anxiety that user data on TikTok could be weaponized by the Chinese government.</p><p>These concerns ignore the elephant in the room: your government does the same thing. They all do. Chinese companies agree to this sort of law upfront, but in the West, companies agree to be compelled to hand the same data over later once an officer of the court tells them to do it.</p><p>If lawmakers are really that concerned, the ability of the U.S. government to weaponize user data should be addressed, too.

<p>Another concern is the potential for manipulating content on the platform. TikTok&apos;s powerful algorithm tailors content feeds to user preferences, creating echo chambers where users are exposed only to information that reinforces their existing beliefs. Lawmakers fear the Chinese government could exploit this by promoting propaganda or misinformation through seemingly innocuous videos. This could distort public perception and undermine democratic processes.</p><p>Beyond national security, some lawmakers worry about the app&apos;s impact on children&apos;s mental health. The endless scroll of short, often addictive videos can create feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Additionally, the platform has been criticized for its prevalence of cyberbullying and exposure to inappropriate content.</p><p>These are valid points here that apply (or should apply) to Meta (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-cant-trust-facebook">FaceBook</a>), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-23-million-dollar-search-privacy-settlement">Google</a>, X (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-removes-option-to-report-misleading-information">Twitter</a>), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smart-home/amazon-admits-releasing-ring-video-footage-without-consent">Amazon</a> with the same gusto. The difference? Once again, China.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wnozZ6bQew7zWZViGPt29" name="tiktok-app-playing-video.jpg" alt="TikTok playing video of a squirrel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wnozZ6bQew7zWZViGPt29.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TikTok vehemently denies all these allegations. It claims to store U.S. user data outside of China and that the Chinese government has no control over its algorithm. It also argues that a ban would stifle free speech and harm millions of American creators and businesses that rely on the platform for their livelihoods.</p><p>The company may be right. Storing user data elsewhere prevents it from being presented to China on demand, and taking away TikTok puts millions out of work. However, TikTok isn&apos;t doing itself any favors when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-owner-boosts-china-ties-invests-in-state-backed-chip-firm">partners with a 100% state-owned Chinese semiconductor company</a> while under congressional investigation in the U.S.</p><p>The debate over TikTok is complicated. There are genuine concerns about data security and potential manipulation, but a complete ban that prevents you from using TikTok on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> might be an overly blunt instrument. Not all problems are nails and not all solutions are hammers.</p><p>Some possible solutions being discussed include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Forced divestiture:</strong> The US could pressure <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-bytedance-xr-partnership">ByteDance</a> to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to an American company, thereby severing the link to the Chinese government.</li><li><strong>Enhanced data security measures:</strong> Stricter regulations and independent audits could ensure user data remains safe within US borders.</li><li><strong>Content moderation:</strong> Working with TikTok to implement stricter content moderation policies could address concerns about harmful content and misinformation.</li></ul>

<p>Whether a ban will materialize is yet to be seen. The House of Representatives recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D">passed a bill that could lead to a ban</a>, but it still needs Senate approval and Presidential signature. Negotiations and potential compromises are likely before a final decision is reached.</p><p>The future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the app has become a focal point in a larger discussion about national security, data privacy, and the influence of social media platforms in the digital age. These are discussions that need to be had, and whether you&apos;re in favor of a potential TikTok ban or opposed to it, you should agree that we need to talk about it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-amazon-big-spring-sale-2">What is the Amazon Big Spring Sale?</h2>
<p>Amazon typically does three major sale events every year. Just like Prime Day and Big Deal Days in October, the Amazon Big Spring Sale is a major shopping event with loads of great deals in just about every product category. This time, however, the discounts aren&apos;t limited to just Prime members: it appears that every visitor to the site during the duration of the sale will gain access to the deals. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-amazon-big-spring-sale-2">When is the Amazon Big Spring Sale?</h2>
<p>On March 14th, Amazon finally confirmed that <strong>the Big Spring Sale will run from March 20th to the 25th</strong>. That&apos;s considerably longer than last year&apos;s sale event, and we&apos;ve also received word that the discounts will be available to all users during the shopping event, not just paying Prime members. </p>
<h2 id="will-other-retailers-be-doing-sales-xa0-2">Will other retailers be doing sales? </h2>
<p>Almost certainly. Whenever Amazon does a big sale event like this, it doesn&apos;t take long for its biggest competitors to follow suit. Expect sitewide sales from Best Buy and Walmart, not to mention Android-friendly retailers and wireless carriers like Samsung and Verizon. We&apos;ll be sharing the best deals from those folks when we learn more. </p>

<ul><li>Emoji reaction effects are available for SMS or RCS messages. </li><li>Ten total reactions are available to users, and each will send a unique animated effect.</li><li>Currently, the feature cannot be disabled for users who are not interested. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is introducing emoji reaction effects that are set to enhance the conversational experience on Google messages.</p><p>For example, a thumbs-up reaction sends several animated thumbs-up icons, while a crying face emoji reaction sends an animated umbrella complete with rain effects. </p><p>To take advantage of this newly deployed feature, users simply need to long-press on a message, either SMS or RCS, and they will be able to select the appropriate reaction from a designated list of 10. </p><p>The 10 reactions are as follows: thumbs up, thumbs down, red heart, face with tears of joy, face with open mouth, enraged face, angry face, crying face, party popper, and more.</p>

<p>This new update follows Google’s introduction of Photomoji, animated emojis, and screen effects. While it was initially revealed back in November as part of a larger message update to celebrate Messages’ 1 billion RCS users, it took a bit to actually make its way to handhelds. </p><p>At the time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/7-new-messages-features/">Google said</a>, “This feature, designed to add a dynamic twist to your chats, embraces the power of expression with all ten of these popular emoji.” </p><p>While these effects may be appealing to many users, other users may not see the same benefit. As it stands, those users are unable to disable the reactions, though that might change in the future. </p><p>In all, the latest update brings Google Messages more in line with the competing iMessage, which is available on Apple’s ecosystem. Previously, iMessage carried such effects, albeit with a different deployment mechanism. Regardless, this update will help add more fun to chats, and fun is always worth celebrating.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Home for Web just got a lot more comprehensive as part of a new update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Google-Home-Access-camera-history-and-download-clips-from-the-Web-and-more/ba-p/605573">Announced by the tech giant on Wednesday</a>, many requested features are making their way to the web. In particular, users will be able to view full histories and create custom clips. </p><p>Per the company, over the next several days, home.google.com will now allow users to take advantage of having access to a larger screen. The newly updated experience, which has been optimized for use with a traditional mouse and keyboard, will allow users to access their entire camera history. From there, users can view specific events and timelines or search for specific dates and times to review. It’s important to note that a Nest Aware Plus subscription will be required for 24/7 playback on the web as it is required on the app. </p><p>Another noteworthy feature rolling out is the ability to create custom clips. Users will be able to designate the duration of the clip on the web by using the added clip editor. Additionally, previous events can be trimmed via the Home app. Nest Aware Plus subscribers can go a step further and export those clips as downloadable files to then be shared or saved. </p><p>The last – and potentially biggest – update is the ability for users to participate in a version of Public Preview for the web. This will allow users to sample features before they become widely available to the public. Interested users can opt in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-to-join-public-preview">here</a>, per the company. </p><p>Some unique features available in the preview include a script editor for home automation, garage door detection, and expanded first-generation camera support. In the first feature, users can see, create, delete, or deactivate scripted automation via home.google.com. </p><p>Garage door detection, available only to Nest Aware subscribers, will notify users if they happen to leave their garage door open. The feature uses “advanced AI-powered image detection and improved built-in on-device intelligence” to help users keep their homes secure. Finally, first-generation Nest Cam indoor or outdoor users can use a new camera history experience in the Google Home app as part of the public preview. </p><p>Overall, Google Home continues to demonstrate why it is a must-have for those who want to make their homes smart. </p>

<hr>
<p>A huge new UI upgrade is coming to the Meta Quest some time this year, and Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth gave us the first details in his March AMA <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/boztank/">on Instagram</a>. The CTO said he didn&apos;t want to "give too much away" before the big reveal but talked about how the company was working to make the Quest UI feel more personalized than ever.</p><p>Bosworth said this new personalized UI would be designed to go wherever life takes you, including the ability to pin windows to you or your head. That would make it possible to walk around and have windows follow you while you do chores or walk around the house.</p><p>Bosworth also said the company is working on allowing users to anchor windows in real space, giving the headset similar abilities to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a> even though it&apos;s 1/7th the price. This means you could pin a display to your wall and make it look and feel more like a TV resting in actual space, among other examples. It would also enhance the headset&apos;s multitasking capabilities by running more windows in the same physical space.</p><p>While the current Meta Quest UI can replicate some of these things with its panel design, Bosworth says that "fluidity with how you interact with these two things is of tremendous opportunity to make things feel really comfortable and clear."</p><p>The new UI will also allow users to interact better with other nearby devices. Bosworth talked about how "casting and streaming present a lot of opportunity" for Meta. Still, we&apos;ve also seen use cases where users can interact with smart home appliances and lighting right in mixed reality. In other words, if Meta is working on integrating nearby device connectivity, we could very well be able to adjust lights and other smart home devices right from the headset.</p>

<p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3 Lite</a> was rumored to drop the color pass through at one point, but Bosworth confirmed that "mixed reality...platform capabilities will be the same" for "several generations of headsets to come."</p><p>Bosworth also talked about user comfort including bringing back the ability to use the Meta Quest 3 while lying down. Currently, the Smart Guardian doesn&apos;t properly track furniture walls safely when users are lying down stationary, but the company says this oversight will be ironed out soon.</p><p>Lastly, the keyboard is getting some impressive improvements with multitouch capabilities. That means you could pin the virtual keyboard to a table and type with all your fingers at once, just as you would on a physical keyboard. That would go quite nicely with the upcoming Airplane mode, as it could mean the virtual keyboard would fit perfectly on that small airplane tray table on the seat.</p><p>There&apos;s no date for the upcoming UI refresh, but it&apos;s expected that Meta will debut the redesign sometime in 2024, potentially alongside a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> announcement.</p>
