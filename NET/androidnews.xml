<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The second Android 15 beta for Nothing Phone 2a brings bug fixes, performance tweaks, and introduces the "Shared Widgets" feature in Nothing OS 3.0.</li><li>"Shared Widgets" allows syncing widgets across devices, but it's still in the works.</li><li>For now, you can pair widgets with friends and family (who also have a Nothing phone) and share reactions and stickers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh Android 15 beta is rolling out to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>, bringing bug fixes, performance tweaks, and the new "Shared Widgets" feature in Nothing OS 3.0.</p><p>While Nothing OS 3.0 is getting closer to its full release, there’s still one big feature missing. When Nothing first teased its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> plans, it hinted at "Shared Widgets," a new way to sync homescreen widgets across multiple devices.</p><p>You’ll be able to "pair" widgets with your friends and family, as long as they’ve got a Nothing phone too. One widget even lets you share reactions and stickers.</p><p>Yet, this feature hasn’t shown up yet on the Phone 2a, until now. This feature is now live in the second Android 15 beta for Nothing's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/12/nothing-phone-2a-android-15-beta-2-widgets/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The Shared Widgets feature first landed on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-android-15-open-beta-start-detailed">start of Nothing’s Android 15 Open Beta earlier this month</a>.</p><p>Nothing has been on point with its Android 15 rollout, following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-android-15-open-beta-start">release schedule it shared back in October</a>. The company has already rolled out Nothing OS 3.0 to the Phone 2 and Phone 2a, just as promised.</p><p>At first, Shared Widgets will offer the basics, mostly letting you share reactions between connected devices. But Nothing has big plans to take this feature to the next level down the line.</p><p>This update also tweaks the new Quick Settings and Smart Drawer features, and brings fixes for some bugs in the camera app.</p><p>Photography lovers will also be happy with this update, which brings better brightness in Ultra HDR and standard HDR, an optimized portrait mode, and smoother camera mode switching.</p><p>As with any beta, there could be some unexpected quirks, but this update is a big step forward. If you've got a compatible Nothing phone, you can check out the new beta on Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/17516-nothing-os-30-phone-2a-open-beta/858" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

<p>EcoFlow has done exceedingly well with its versatile array of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-portable-power-stations">portable power stations</a> and power kits. Our reviewers have always found the brand's products to be top-tier, especially the large-and-in-charge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ecoflow-delta-pro-review">EcoFlow Delta Pro</a>, and more recently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ecoflow-river-2-max-review">EcoFlow River 2 Max</a>. It seems that EcoFlow is now switching lanes and pivoting to smaller, more pocket-sized power solutions with its new launches.</p><p>The company just launched its first MagSafe and Qi2-compatible power bank called the EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic Power Bank (5000mAh). It's nice to EcoFlow try its hand at something different, especially because the on-paper specs look very attractive.</p><p>Other products released alongside the EcoFlow Rapid include a few USB-C chargers and the usual power stations and kits. The magnetic power bank stood out to me, so I decided to test it out for myself.</p>

<p>My go-to portable power bank is a credit card-sized one from Zendure. Ever since I got it last year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/dont-sleep-on-these-zendure-charging-accessories-during-black-friday">Zendure SuperMini</a> has been in my purse and has traveled to at least three countries with me. Although I am really fond of my Zendure SuperMini, the 10,000mAh battery pack is heavier than it looks, which isn't ideal for portability.</p><p>So, I ditched the Zendure in favor of the EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic Power Bank for a weekend trip. Since I carry at least two phones with me at all times, having access to a power bank on the go is crucial for me. That said, swapping a generous 10,000mAh power bank for a 5,000mAh one made me nervous because it can only recharge one phone fully on a single charge.</p><p>However, I soon realized that you probably don't really need much more than a 5,000mAh power bank. Most people with regular jobs carry a single phone. Even if you carry two phones, you probably charge them fully before heading out or will likely only find yourself needing to charge one while you're out and about. That's what I do, as it makes sense to be prudent and reduces potential hassle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7m82cmrJyUJhbYJfTsbrjE" name="EcoFlow-RAPID-Magnetic-Power-Bank-5000mAh-7.jpg" alt="EcoFlow RAPID Magnetic Power Bank (5000mAh)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7m82cmrJyUJhbYJfTsbrjE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic Power Bank might have a smaller battery capacity, but it brings several key advantages in exchange for that sacrifice. A big pro is the built-in USB-C cable. This instantly reduced clutter in my purse as I didn't have to carry a cable.</p><p>You get a decent 30W wired charging speed with the built-in Type-C cable, which is more than enough juice for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. Most power banks this small usually only support around 20W wired charging speeds. For example, the Anker 633 Magnetic Battery only supports 20W charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hJdUoTTXo7EkwA6ieXZG5E" name="EcoFlow-RAPID-Magnetic-Power-Bank-5000mAh-5.jpg" alt="EcoFlow RAPID Magnetic Power Bank (5000mAh)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hJdUoTTXo7EkwA6ieXZG5E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a> port on the side for power input, which is also a speedy 30W, so you can recharge it quickly. There are LED indicators on the back to let you know how much power is left in the power bank and whether it is charging. And if you want to forgo the cable entirely, the EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic Power Bank also supports 15W Qi2 and MagSafe wireless charging. You can also charge two devices at once, one via cable and the other wirelessly.</p><p>The power bank's magnetism works in its favor in more than one way. Of course, it helps to align the wireless charging coils and keeps them in place. But it also acts as a grip to hold your phone when the EcoFlow Rapid's clip-shaped kickstand is in use. The kickstand can be used in both portrait and landscape orientations.</p>

<p>EcoFlow did a good job with the design. The mix of gray, ash, and silver hues combined with different textures looks awesome and it's functional too. Thanks to the blend of different materials used to make the EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic Power Bank, it has an anti-slip base that prevents your phone from slipping when propped up.</p><p>Another cool thing about the compact design is that the EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic Power Bank is just as small as popular alternatives like the Zendure SuperMini but weighs next to nothing in comparison. Of course, you only get half the power, which is a factor to consider.</p><p>I'm excited to know that EcoFlow will soon release a 10,000mAh version of this brilliant little magnetic power bank. I just hope it retains the size and doesn't add too much weight compared to the 5,000mAh variant. It is still a good buy, although the $69.99 price tag is a little steep.</p><p>Frugal buyers could wait until November 21 to take advantage of the early Black Friday sale, which EcoFlow has already announced on its website. The EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic Power Bank (5000mAh) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.ecoflow.com/products/rapid-magnetic-power-bank">slated to go on sale for $39.99</a> once the deal goes live. Now that would make this already great purchase an absolute steal.</p>

While we're already getting the first 2025 flagships from companies like OPPO, OnePlus, and Xiaomi, we're going to have to wait a bit longer before Samsung's next major phone launch. How long, you ask? While we don't have a definitive answer for that yet, we can make an educated guess on when the Galaxy S25 series will launch.</p><p>Be sure to check back periodically, as we'll be updating this page with any new information as it arrives, including official details on the Galaxy S25 launch when Samsung provides them.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-narrowing-down-the-galaxy-s25-launch-date"><span>Narrowing down the Galaxy S25 launch date</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Surprisingly, Samsung has already started teasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which will be the first to feature the upcoming One UI 7 update. That beta is expected before the end of the year, but Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">revealed</a> at its annual developer conference that the stable update will be "released next year with the next Galaxy S series." That's a pretty vague window, but Samsung narrowed it down a bit more during its Q3 2024 earnings report.</p><p>While teasing upcoming products for next year, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-s25-teases-cheaper-foldable-xr-device-2025">revealed</a> that the Galaxy S25 will be released in the first half of 2025.</p><p>"The Galaxy S25 series, which will be released in the first half of next year, plans to lead daily innovation by increasing the experience perfection of Galaxy AI and expand sales by strengthening marketing and experience programs."</p><p>While that's still pretty vague, we can use previous years to make an educated guess as to when we can expect the Galaxy S25 to be unveiled. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> was launched at an Unpacked event on January 17, while the Galaxy S23 series was unveiled on February 1, 2023, and the Galaxy S22 on February 9, 2022.</p><p>In fact, a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/pnk505/status/1856291194323767662">tweet</a> revealed that the phone could launch as early as January 5, 2025. Based on this, it seems Samsung has been moving up its product launch closer to the start of the year, although it still remains somewhat unconfirmed. We likely won't know the exact details of the launch until the first official Galaxy Unpacked 2025 teaser, which could happen in November or December.</p>

<p>While the Galaxy S25 announcement will likely happen in mid-January, the devices will probably not go on sale that same day. Instead, the company will have a period when prospective buyers can preorder the phone so that it arrive at their doorstep  on the day of its release.</p><p>For the Galaxy S24, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-features-galaxy-s24-series-detailed">announcement</a> happened on January 17, while the phones were not available to buy in-store until January 31, exactly two weeks later. Samsung will likely follow a similar release schedule with the Galaxy S25, meaning the phone could be available in January.</p><p>Those who preorder their phones may also receive their devices early, which is one of the perks of reserving and preordering as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Ahead of a launch, Samsung often teases its upcoming devices by opening up reservations for its devices. While the company normally doesn't name said devices, it's usually not too hard to guess what it has coming. Fortunately, reserving a device doesn't mean you have to commit to purchasing it, but if you do go through with preordering a Galaxy S25, Samsung will likely reward you with a credit of some sort to help cover the cost of the phone or accessories.</p><p>We have an early guide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25 preorder deals</a> that will tell you more about what to expect from Samsung when we get closer to the launch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nubia has revealed official RedMagic 10 Pro renders, flaunting a clean, minimalist look with a flat design and uninterrupted, edge-to-edge display, with no selfie camera cutout to break the view.</p><p>New high-res images posted by the company on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5099463906165632" target="_blank">Weibo</a> show that the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phone</a> will come in a mix of color options, including Dark Knight, Day Warrior, Deuterium Transparent Dark Night, and Deuterium Transparent Silver Wing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/11/redmagic-10-pro-design-revealed-antutu-record.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>).</p><p>The Deuterium models stand out with their unique design, featuring transparent upper back panels. Meanwhile, the Dark Knight and Day Warrior versions go for a more classic look but still turn heads with a metallic, angular style.</p><p>The RedMagic 10 Pro makes a bold statement with its entirely flat design. Like its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic-9-pro-review">RedMagic 9 Pro</a>, it eliminates the rear camera bump for an uninterrupted look. The full-view display takes things further with no notches or cutouts, all thanks to its under-display camera technology.</p><p>The device features impressively slim bezels, and it’s set to break records for both bezel thickness and screen-to-body ratio. Rumors suggest the phone will pack a 6.86-inch OLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate.</p>

I used most phones released in 2024, and it has been a good year for device launches, both in the flagship and mid-range segments.</p><p>The state of the phone industry is such that we don&apos;t get massive upgrades every single year, and as such, most 2024 phones have been iterative updates. What&apos;s ironic is that the few devices that really stood out this year — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultr</a>a, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> — are limited to select regions and aren&apos;t widely available.</p><p>That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9</a> series is noticeably better than previous years, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> has improved tuning that allows it to take great photos, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is undoubtedly one of the biggest hits of the year.</p><p>If you&apos;re on an older device and are looking to upgrade or just need to make the switch to the latest tech, these are my phone recommendations for Black Friday. Although phone deals aren&apos;t live yet, earlier sales in the year gave us a good indication as to what we might get in terms of pricing, and I&apos;m adding my own estimates.</p>

<p>OnePlus did all the right things in 2024, and the OnePlus 12 continues to be a fantastic device. It handles demanding games without breaking a sweat, the battery life is among the best of any device, and it has already switched to a stable Android 15 build. The cameras are terrific as well, and it is able to hold its own against the best Android phones. The OnePlus 12 went down to as low as $599 earlier in the year, and that might be the case this holiday season as well. If it's anything under $599, the phone becomes an instant buy.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Smartphone-Processor-Hasselblad/dp/B0CQ5MYYZL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="085cf796-f1af-486e-8e5d-2d5f28b00cae" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12: $802 at Amazon" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12: $802 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>I used the 9 Pro XL much more than the regular 9 Pro, but I got started with the latter recently, and I have to say that I prefer it to the larger model. You get the same great cameras and software features, and while the battery isn't as big, I still get a day's worth out of it. While the device is relatively new, Google is usually generous with holiday deals, and if you can get anywhere close to $200 off, just buy the phone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HVCD91" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="932d0eb9-7404-4ee3-bee0-815a0d756d49" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro: $999 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9 Pro: $999 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>I test a lot of mid-range phones, and there are only two devices you need to pay attention to in this category: the Pixel 8a and OnePlus 12R. The Pixel 8a has better cameras, and the hardware is decent — if not great for gaming. You get a good OLED panel with 120Hz refresh, good battery life, and the best software of any mid-range phone. The Pixel 8a went down to $379 (it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQ916ZY?">$399 right now</a>) earlier in the year, and it should be available for the same price once again, making it the bargain of the year.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQFJSRF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9c1ee2f6-7c7e-401a-b4d3-55d4cb083e77" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 8a: $399 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 8a: $399 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>It's a good thing OnePlus decided to sell the 12R globally, because the phone is still one of the best value-focused devices available today. It has a vibrant AMOLED panel, great hardware, terrific main camera, and stellar battery life and fast charging tech. It was available for $399, but anything lower than that would make it a downright steal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ9SZ6CP?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c923b2b0-1015-452b-9008-3f508010d57a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12R: $499 at Amazon" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12R: $499 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>You don't actually need to wait until Black Friday as the S24 Ultra is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDM65JH">down to $1,079</a> right now, but I recommend waiting — it's going to be discounted in the coming weeks. Although the S25 Ultra is on the horizon, it shouldn't be radically different to what Samsung is already offering, and if you can get the S24 Ultra for anywhere close to the $900 mark, it would be a great option.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDM65JH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d4204912-f7f7-4482-adad-794b574fda15" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: $1,079 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: $1,079 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Retailers aren&apos;t waiting around until Black Friday to launch deals; Walmart already has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/walmart-just-dropped-its-first-batch-of-black-friday-deals-and-android-users-should-take-note">early deals available right now</a>, and they include decent discounts. I&apos;ll update this post once any of the deals on the aforementioned devices go live, so check back regularly.</p>

<p>Now that the Samsung Galaxy S24 has been out for a while, you can't help but wonder what specifications the next S series model will have. We don't have the official specs for the S25 just yet, but with all the rumors and leaks out there, we are creating a speculative Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S24 comparison to get an idea of what you <em>might</em> get and whether it might be worth upgrading to the next model.</p><p>If it follows the same pattern as the last two launches, Samsung could announce the S25 before January ends. The first rumors about the S25 appeared in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-rumored-price-increase">October 2023</a>, stating that the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a> could lead to a higher price tag at launch. Time will tell what official specs we see on the S25, but in the meantime, putting together a speculative comparison will be fun.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-purple-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding design, there is a good chance Samsung will stick to the design we've been looking at for years, which has rounded edges, a flat front, and flat sides. Rumors also indicate we could see the same colors from the S24 on the S25 model. That said, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">leaked renders</a>, we could be looking at a slight design change. It seems like Samsung is going for a unified look across all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra models.</p><p>The S25 could have flat sides all around, flat back and front glass, and rounded corners. Rumors also say the S25 will be slightly smaller than the previous model, possibly 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. The phone's weight is unavailable, but it may weigh around 167 and 168 grams, given that the past three models are between this weight range. We haven't encountered any rumors on the possible IP rating for the S25, but since the S24 has an IP68 rating, there is no reason to think that the S25 won't see a similar rating on the S25.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">possible colors for the S25</a> include Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Blue, and Titanium Silver. Samsung has not released any official information on the specs of the S25. Still, regarding the IP rating, the expectation is that it'll maintain the S24's rating since it's a standard rating for high-end flagship phones. You can also expect it to have thinner bezels.</p><p>The <strong>Samsung Galaxy S24</strong> measures 147.0 x 70.6 7.6mm, weighs 167 grams, and has an IP68 rating, which makes it dust-tight. You can submerge it for 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. You can choose from different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-galaxy-s24-should-you-buy">Galaxy S24 colors</a>, such as Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, and Marble Grey (Samsung exclusive Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange).</p><p>It also has a flat front and back with rounded edges and a soft finish. Armor aluminum makes the Galaxy S24 lighter than steel. It also has a Corning Gorilla Armor screen, which makes it more durable. The three cameras are in a vertical row on the back, a design likely to repeat itself on the newer model.</p>

<p>Like with almost every upgrade from the same manufacturer, there is usually no massive difference between the latest and previous models.

The Galaxy S24 can reach a peak brightness of 2,600 nits and has Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection. It offers excellent colors and a Super HDR preview on the viewfinder. Samsung also added Vision Booster to increase the brightness outdoors by flickering the display on and off.</p>

<p>Rumors about the <strong>Samsung Galaxy S25</strong> mention that Samsung could drop its current camera hardware in favor of Sony. According to a leak, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> (essentially a rebranded Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip) will give the phone a performance jump thanks to the Oryon cores. Other rumors indicate Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-models-to-opt-for-flagship-exynos-soc-again">opt for an Exynos chip</a>, saving the Snapdragon for the Ultra model.</p><p>All three S25 models could borrow the camera module style for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and come with a more traditional DSLR camera lens with thicker borders and ribbed edges. The leaked renders don't show an S Pen for the Ultra model, but we still don't know what the final design will look like, meaning Samsung may not be ditching the built-in stylus.</p><p>Recognized tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1837452794909086073">Ice Universe</a> also states that the S25 will have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors">same camera setup as the S24</a>. which would corroborate other rumors. The smartphone could have a 50MP wide main, 10MP telephoto, and 12MP ultrawide. It also has a 12MP selfie camera. If the rumors are true and the camera specs are the same, the rumored added <strong>RAM</strong> to help process the AI could make up for it.</p><p>Even though Samsung has not confirmed the specs, and the S25 at least matches its predecessor, we could be looking at storage options such as 128GB and 256GB. The S25 should have a 4,000mAh battery and support wired and wireless charging. However, some leaks indicate a 5,000mAh battery, which is even better. If the S25 does have a bigger battery, there is a good chance we could see the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">new AI battery feature</a> aims to save up to 10% of battery life.</p><p>How does this compare to the <strong>Galaxy S24</strong> that is available right now? It has non-expandable 128GB and 256GB storage variants, stereo speakers, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery. The Galaxy S24 also has a 50MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP telephoto, and 12MP selfie camera.</p><p>Regarding charging speeds, the Galaxy S24 has 25W wired charging, 15W wireless, and 4.5 reverse wireless charging. The advertised charging speed is 50% battery in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>We know the Galaxy S25 will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">One UI 7</a> on top of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. The software upgrade appears to include a new visual style, icons, customization options, and more.

With Galaxy AI, you can have fun with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">generative AI wallpaper</a> and generative edit features.

You can also have Gemini help you get information, identify objects, or tell you where to buy them. You also get seven years of software updates, so there is no reason to believe why you wouldn't get the same with the S25.</p>

Remember, good things come to those who wait.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly rolling out an upgraded Quick Share app to Windows PCs with the 64-bit version of the OS and ARM-supported devices.</li><li>The company states that ARM computers with Windows 11 and above can utilize the app.</li><li>Google may bring its Quick Share app to Apple's iOS devices like the iPhone and Mac.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports state Google has started rolling out its new Quick Share app for Windows PCs and laptops.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/11/google-quick-share-windows-arm-release-coming/">9to5Google</a>, the company has started pushing a revamped version of the Quick Share app for ARM-based Windows computers. Google made this upgraded app known via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/better-together/quick-share-app/">updated Quick Share page</a>. The company states users with a Windows computer running the 64-bit version of Windows 10 and up can download and install.</p><p>Moreover, Google highlights the app's newfound availability on ARM-supported Windows PCs and laptops running Windows 11 and higher. With the app slowly becoming available, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/13801258?visit_id=638669564879441517-2725905576&p=windows_nearby_share&rd=1#topic=7313011">Google states</a> folks in the U.S. and "most countries" can find it to download.</p><p>Those downloading the Quick Share app on Windows are encouraged to update their sharing settings. Google states users should click <strong>Settings > Device Visibility </strong>and select a preferable option. An option titled "Your Device" lets your PC/laptop find devices with your Google Account.</p><p>Additionally, users should enable Wi-Fi <em>and </em>Bluetooth, so the Quick Share app can function properly.</p><p>Google's newfound support for "ARM-supported" Windows computers concerns those rocking Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite chipset</a>. The SoC was highlighted as one ready for the future of AI with "4.5 times faster" processing speed "than competitors." Qualcomm also stated that it wanted to facilitate a seamless experience between mobile, PC, and cars.</p><p>Of course, we're seeing that pairing much more now with the addition of Google's updated Quick Share app for Windows.</p>

<p>The publication states that the ability to download the new Quick Share app hasn't arrived just yet. The manual download button isn't functioning, but that should be solved within the day or later this week.</p><p>As Google upgrades its Quick Share app for more Windows computers, the company is reportedly working to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-likely-to-bring-android-quick-share-for-apple-devices">bring it to iOS devices</a>. A dive into the popular Android app revealed that Google could debut the app on iPhones and Macs after a recent patch. The changelog reportedly stated the fixes were implemented to "benefit" Apple's devices.</p><p>Google has yet to debut the app, but this little line could spell its impending launch.</p><p>Moreover, Google's updated Quick Share app is another option for Windows users who'd rather not use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/phone-link-is-looking-more-like-windows-answer-to-apples-airdrop">Phone Link</a>. The app picked up an update this summer that made its version of file sharing much easier to rival Apple's AirDrop.</p>

<hr>
<p>One UI 7 beta is the highly anticipated operating system upgrade many flagship Galaxy owners look forward to. According to the latest information, it may happen sooner.</p><p>The tip comes from Ice Universe, who has shared the possible timeline and countries in the One UI 7 beta that will first ship. According to the tipster's X post, the Android 15-based One UI 7's first beta will hit devices sometime after November 17. The first regions are likely to be the U.S. and Samsung's home ground South Korea.</p>

<p>The latest information only corroborates what Samsung announced at its SDSC early last month. With a sneak peek, the Korean tech giant has announced that the first beta One UI 7 will be available for developers by the end of this year. According to the latest tip from Ice Universe, it will be coming early enough.</p><p>The global rollout, however, is likely coming early next year, with the launch of Samsung's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a>, the Galaxy S25 series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">During SDSC</a>, Samsung also noted that the upcoming One UI 7 update will include a "new UX focused on simple, impactful and emotive design alongside more ways to seamlessly integrate Galaxy AI features into daily activities."</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly gearing up to launch Gemini 2.0, its next artificial intelligence model.</li><li>Now, a new model titled <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong> has appeared for at least one user of the Gemini web client.</li><li>It's unclear if this curiously-named AI model is truly powered by Gemini 2.0 Pro, or when the model will become widely available.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google and OpenAI are both planning to release the next versions of their flagship AI models by year's end, or in early 2024. Prior reports indicated that the two companies are gearing up to ship Gemini 2.0 and Orion, respectively, sometime in December. More recently, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/google-gearing-up-for-gemini-2-0-launch-with-new-ai-model-in-testing/" target="_blank">TestingCatalog</a> spotted a new and conspicuously-named Gemini model that could be Gemini 2.0 Pro.</p><p>TestingCatalog says that the model is "quite fast" responding to prompts, but that it's impossible to know whether it's really Gemini 2.0 Pro under the hood. It's named <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong>, and was discovered in the dropdown menu that lets you select which model the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> chatbot uses. Currently, the option for free users is Gemini 1.5 Flash. Paid subscribers gain access to Gemini Advanced, which adds Gemini 1.5 Pro.</p><p>The new <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111 </strong>model appears under the Gemini Advanced section in the dropdown menu, signaling that it will begin as a paid exclusive. However, it's possible (and perhaps likely) that Google is working on a Gemini 2.0 Flash model that could replace Gemini 1.5 Flash for free users.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong> is really Gemini 2.0 Pro, like how it's labeled as "our experimental model" by Google. However, there's no way to know for sure. It could be a user-interface test, or simply appear by accident. Being that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-2-dot-0-likely-to-launch-in-december-2024">prior reports expected a December 2024 release for Gemini 2.0</a>, it's reasonable that Google would be expanding tests for the model in the days or weeks immediately preceding its launch.</p><p>TestingCatalog confirms that <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong> can respond to prompts, draw images, and search the web. It's not available to the public yet, so you won't find it by going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">gemini.google.com</a>. A release sometime next month would mark exactly one year after the first Gemini model debuted. As a reminder, Gemini now references the underlying model (like the upcoming Gemini Pro 2.0 model), and the interface that lets you interact with the model (such as the Gemini web client).</p><p>By all accounts, the Gemini 2.0 Pro model will be made available as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>, which costs $20 per month and includes Gemini Advanced.</p>
