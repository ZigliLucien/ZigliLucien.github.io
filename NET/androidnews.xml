<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 kept the same design as last year (only slightly thicker) and shed the classy Classic upgrade option, which you may not like. But the Watch 7's revamped BioSensor will make the watch more useful for health monitoring, the new Exynos chip loads apps faster, and LTE fans will appreciate the doubled storage for better on-wrist music playlists.</p></p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 and 7 could be twins, at least on the surface. If you were hoping the Watch 7 would make changes to things like the display, battery capacity, or overall <em>look</em> — or if you have the Watch 6 Classic and love your rotating bezel — then you may want to stick with your Watch 6 for now, as it's still an excellent smartwatch.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 follows a similar template to the Galaxy Watch 6. Most Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Galaxy Watch 6 upgrades can be found in its performance, storage, and health/fitness tracking.</p><p>Changes to the colors and bands aside, you&apos;d have a lot of trouble telling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch 6</a> apart; they have the same display sizes, protection, digital bezel, and overall look, with their weights differing by less than a gram.</p><p>Below, we&apos;ll compare the Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Watch 6 to help you decide whether to trade in your Watch 6 for the Watch 7 or to hold out for the Galaxy Watch 8. Even though the Galaxy Watch 7 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> available today, you may not find enough major differences to justify an upgrade.</p>

<p>If you own the Galaxy Watch 6, these aspects of your current watch will remain unchanged with the Galaxy Watch 7:</p><p><strong>Displays:</strong> Both watches ship in 40mm and 44mm case sizes, with matching 1.3-inch and 1.5-inch displays. They have the same resolution (432x432 or 480x480, based on the size) and the same 2,000 nits of brightness, which is fairly standard for flagship watches and is only beaten by the 3,000-nit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</p><p>Plus, both rely on a digital touch bezel, letting you scroll your finger along the display edge to slide down menus or across Tiles. We&apos;re ignoring the Watch 6 Classic and its physical bezel for this comparison. </p><p><strong>Memory</strong>: Both watches have 2GB of RAM, the current max we&apos;ve seen in smartwatches.</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: Technically, the Watch 7 40mm and 44mm weigh 0.1g and 0.5g more than their Watch 6 counterparts, but your wrist could never tell the difference. It&apos;s the same physical profile.</p><p><strong>Protection: </strong>Both watches have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">maximum ingress protection</a> for dust and water resistance, specifically lasting for up to 30 minutes in 1.5 meters of water or 10 minutes in 50 meters of depth.</p><p>They also have equal sapphire display scratch protection. Samsung claims they both passed MIL-STD-810H tests for high/low temperature, altitude, humidity, immersion, salt, fog, dust, vibration, and drops.</p>

<p><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> While the Galaxy Watch 7 might last longer than the Watch 6 (more on that below), the actual capacity remains unchanged for both sizes. The 44mm Watch 7 and 6 have 125mAh extra capacity, but the larger display mostly cancels this out.</p><p><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Either watch provides the same efficient Bluetooth 5.3 standard, NFC payments via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Google Wallet or Samsung Wallet</a>, WiFi 2.4 and 5 GHz, and LTE connectivity. For the latter, you have to pay for the cellular Watch 6 or 7 upfront for $50 extra, then add it to your cellular plan.</p><p><strong>Software:</strong> As of early August, the Galaxy Watch 6 hasn&apos;t updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, but that should change soon after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> launch, according to rumors. From that point onwards, the Watch 7 and 6 will have the same software and security updates until mid-2027, when the Watch 6 runs out of support. That means another three years of comparable software perks, if you don&apos;t upgrade.</p><p><strong>Sensors:</strong> While the Watch 7 did get an important sensor upgrade, what it tracks is mostly unchanged from past generations: resting and current heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), passive atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection, active AFib detection (ECG), skin temperature, blood oxygen (SpO2), nighttime breathing rate, and menstrual cycles.</p><p>You also get the same accelerometer and gyroscope for workout tracking, barometer for elevation data, geomagnetic sensor for navigation, and ambient light sensor to auto-adjust the display to your surroundings. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-app-drawer.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's app drawer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why upgrade from the Galaxy Watch 6 to the Galaxy Watch 7? Here are the main differences, based on differences between our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7 review test</a> and our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 review</a> (and my subsequent months using the last-gen watch):</p><p><strong>Better heart rate accuracy:</strong> The Galaxy Watch 7 has 13 heart rate sensor LEDs to the Watch 6&apos;s four LEDs. Where the Watch 6 had green, red, and IR sensors, the Watch 7 adds new colors — Blue, Yellow, Violet and Ultraviolet — while needing fewer photodiodes to power them all.</p><p>Samsung claims that the Watch 7&apos;s "optimal allocation" of green, red, and IR LEDs "more accurately measures health metrics such as heart rate, sleep quality, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and stress levels" than the Watch 6. In particular, it&apos;s supposed to be 30% more accurate during high-intensity workouts.</p><p>I performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a> — the Ultra and Watch 7 share sensors — and it did very well for heart rate accuracy, though it still struggled a bit to track heart rates in the 170+ bpm range. Still, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-fitness-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 6 fitness test</a> gave me less accurate results, so athletes will be happy with this change.</p><p><strong>More accurate dual-band GPS:</strong> The Galaxy Watch 7 is the first Samsung watch to have dual-band GPS, which tracks you from multiple satellite types (older L1s and newer L5s) to circumvent signal blockage or reflections off of buildings, mountains, tree cover, and so on.</p><p>Again, the Watch Ultra did extremely well compared to a dual-band Garmin watch in our tests, only 0.01 miles off after nearly 10 miles. This accuracy should apply to the Watch 7, as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3802px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ZQgQLnZaJLZph7TTjf2yRe" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-health-sensor-curvature.jpg" alt="The new health sensor curvature on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQgQLnZaJLZph7TTjf2yRe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3802" height="2139" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>AGEs index (and future health data): </strong>With those extra LED colors, Samsung tracks your body&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">advanced glycation end products (AGEs) index</a>, or the products that form in your bloodstream in response to excess sugar; a high AGEs index can be a warning sign for serious health conditions like diabetes or heart disease.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s announcement claims that this new metric is "one of the many new advanced features planned for the next Galaxy Watch" enabled by the new LED colors. In other words, any new health metrics Samsung works on will come to the Watch 7, but <em>not</em> the Watch 6 because of its limited LED colors. </p><p>We can&apos;t say whether this health data will be worth the update, and the Watch 6 already catches several health warning signs. The Galaxy Watch 7 is future-proofed for health data, but you could probably wait another year for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Watch 8</a>, when Samsung has implemented more of these mysterious health features.</p><p><strong>A thicker Galaxy Watch 7:</strong> Samsung says that the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 6 are 9.7mm and 9.0mm thick, respectively. Neither is that skinny; Samsung doesn&apos;t include its BioSensor when measuring its watches, which is quite misleading. In truth, the Watch 6 is about 12mm thick, while the Watch 7 is at least 13mm thick. </p><p>Our Watch 7 reviewer noted that "The dome of the array curves higher, making the watch sit higher on lanky wrists like mine, but for thicker wrists, you shouldn&apos;t notice much of a difference." In other words, the new and improved health data has a visual impact on how it looks in real life, even if it&apos;s identical from the top-down.</p><p><strong>Colors and watch band options:</strong> The Watch 6 shipped in Graphite, Gold, and Silver, while the Watch 7 comes in Green, Cream, and Silver. </p><p>Aesthetics aside, the Watch 6 had more band options at launch: Sport, Extreme Sport, Hybrid Leather D or Leather T, and Fabric. The Galaxy Watch 7 has three core options: Fabric, Sport, and Athleisure. As always, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">third-party Galaxy Watch 7 band options</a>, but fans of leather or more breathable sport bands might be disappointed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="9UNAC8Hicc5fbuv4o2dZTb" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-media-playback-youtube-music.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's media playback controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UNAC8Hicc5fbuv4o2dZTb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The Galaxy Watch 7 uses one ARM Cortex-A78 1.6GHz core and four Cortex-A55 1.5GHz cores; the Watch 6 uses dual Cortex-A55 1.4GHz cores. As you might expect, this gives the Watch 7 much more capacity for high-end processing and faster app loading times.</p><p>In practice, our Watch 7 reviewer noted that it&apos;s "the zippiest smartwatch I&apos;ve ever used, but it&apos;s not magnitudes faster" than the Watch 6, "at least during everyday activities." That&apos;s similar to my experience with the Watch Ultra, which shares the Watch 7 chip; it loads apps very quickly, but the Watch 6 was also quite fast thanks to the comparable RAM.</p><p>Some of its extra performance capacity goes directly into running the extra LED sensors, which require more power to run. Otherwise, the Exynos W1000 is more future-proofed for future Wear OS updates, which might take more advantage of the extra power.</p><p><strong>Storage: </strong>The Galaxy Watch 6 has 16GB of storage, or less than 6GB once you account for default Wear OS software. That doesn&apos;t leave much wiggle room if you like to download music, podcasts, or audiobooks for streaming on the go while leaving your phone behind. Thankfully, the Watch 7 has boosted storage space up to 32GB, giving you more wiggle room for media and apps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VcwY8W9VvwdEcBmz8Zfejh" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-step-count.jpg" alt="Daily step count on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VcwY8W9VvwdEcBmz8Zfejh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>(Slight) battery life boost: </strong>Samsung never gave us an official battery life estimate for the Galaxy Watch 7. Our reviewer found that it lasted two days (48 hours) with standard use and sleep tracking, while it lasted closer to 33–36 hours with more outdoor use (which uses more nits of brightness) and one dual-band GPS workout.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 was rated to last 40 hours at launch, and yours has probably lost a little of its capacity since then. Our Watch 7 reviewer credits the Exynos W1000&apos;s "improved efficiency" as being able to handle certain tasks without as much battery burn, and it&apos;s fair to say that the Watch 6 will be less capable of handling demanding app tasks moving forward.</p><p>As a side note, some early Galaxy Watch 7 users have reported the opposite, with their watch barely lasting a day per charge. We&apos;re hoping this stems from early Wear OS 5 bugs that&apos;ll be resolved soon, since they would presumably affect the Watch 6, too.</p><p>If you&apos;re not much of an active Wear OS user and primarily use your Galaxy Watch 6 to check notifications and the weather, you&apos;re probably fine. Power users will benefit from a little extra capacity, but you&apos;ll need the Ultra for a true boost.</p><p><strong>No more Wireless PowerSharing: </strong>An unintended side effect of the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s health sensor redesign is that it prevented Samsung from making it compatible with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Wireless PowerSharing</a> standard. </p><p>You can no longer charge the Watch 7 (or Ultra) by placing it atop your flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>, while you still can do so with the Galaxy Watch 6. It&apos;s a useful trick if your Watch 6 dies and you don&apos;t have a charging puck on hand, though quite finicky if your phone has a protective case.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KRotNvqeMknorvCre7tVzD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-1.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRotNvqeMknorvCre7tVzD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is offering a trade-in deal of a $99 Watch 7 and a free second band in exchange for your Watch 6. As long as that deal&apos;s available, you have plenty of reasons to upgrade. If you&apos;re paying full price or own the Watch 6 Classic, it&apos;s harder to justify the switch.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is significantly better than the Watch 6 in key areas, with only a couple of minor drawbacks with its thickness and disabled PowerSharing in exchange for better health and fitness data. It&apos;s not <em>that</em> much faster than the Watch 6, and Samsung has to figure out the current battery drain issue, but it&apos;s more than we expected, given many Android watches keep the same CPU across generations. </p><p>If you have the Watch 6 Classic, you&apos;ll lose your stylish steel design and better bezel controls in exchange for all of the above perks and a lighter fit. That&apos;s probably a tough pill to swallow unless you <em>don&apos;t</em> like your Classic.</p><p>As for standard Galaxy Watch 6 owners, you may want to wait another generation for the differences to be more significant. This could depend, however, on whether you believe the rumors that Samsung wants to switch to a squircle design with future watches. If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> ends up with a squircle display — which Apple users love and plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> owners hate — then maybe there&apos;s no reason to wait.</p>

<p>The best NAS for Plex should let you stream your media collection to all connected devices in your home. Plex is a terrific platform that lets you manage your media library with ease, and the service has a ton of useful extras when it comes to video playback. The best part is that the Plex client is available on just about every platform, making it straightforward to stream your content. And you don&apos;t need to pay anything to get started. </p><p>Plex has a paid tier called Plex Pass that gives you a ton of additional features, including the ability to use hardware transcoding. If you have a lot of older media that needs to be transcoded before being played back on TVs or phones, you may want to go this route. But for a majority of users, the free Plex media server is going to be more than adequate. </p><p>You can do plenty of other things with a NAS, including backing up photos and videos from all of your phones, setting up virtual machines, accessing powerful productivity software that doesn&apos;t need any monthly fee, and a whole lot more. NAS servers designed for Plex tend to have powerful hardware in general, unlocking a suite of enticing use cases in addition to streaming media.</p><p>I tested dozens of NAS models over the last three years, and these are the best Plex NAS servers you can buy today.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS923+ is a powerful 4-bay server that does an amazing job as a Plex media server. The Ryzen hardware is more powerful than its Intel rival, but the downside is that you miss on Plex transcodes. If you don't need the feature, the DS923+ is a fantastic choice.</p>

<p>If you need a Plex server on a budget, the DS223j has a lot to offer. It misses out on some of the advanced features that you get in costlier NAS servers, but as a basic home media streaming solution, it ticks all the right boxes.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re new to Plex and just want a NAS that lets you stream your media collection, you should get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DiskStation DS224+</a>. The NAS has two drive bays, is powered by Intel&apos;s reliable Celeron J4125 platform, and comes with 2GB of RAM as standard. You get dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, two USB ports, and the design has good passive ventilation along with a 92mm fan at the back that manages thermals well.</p><p>That said, the hardware isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find in this segment; you don&apos;t get any M.2 drives, and you miss out on multi-Gigabit connectivity. But it&apos;s all about achieving the right balance, and the DS224+ definitely manages to do that. Although it misses out on a few things, there are no issues with performance, and for most users, Gigabit Ethernet is still more than adequate.</p><p>Where the DS224+ truly shines is its ability as a Plex media server. The NAS has a native Plex client, and configuring it takes less than five minutes. And as it uses an Intel platform, you get hardware-based transcoding — if you have Plex Pass. Most users don&apos;t need to transcode content, but if you want to share your Plex library and have devices that can&apos;t play back the content natively, it comes in handy.</p><p>I tested Plex extensively on the DS224+, and the NAS does a terrific job playing back high bitrate 4K content without any issues. And if you need the feature, it holds up well with transcodes as well. Another standout feature is the software itself; the DS224+ runs DiskStation Manager (DSM), and it has an extensive suite of utilities that make a genuine difference — you won&apos;t get this level of polish with other brands. DSM also has useful mobile apps that let you access your data on the go.</p><p>Ultimately, the DS224+ is a powerful server that&apos;s a great choice for Plex, and you can&apos;t really go wrong with the NAS.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds423-plus-review">DiskStation DS423+</a> is nearly identical to the DS224+, and the key difference between the two is that the DS423+ has four drive bays, giving you the ability to house twice as much storage. You also get two M.2 slots on the underside, and that lets you use NVMe SSDs in addition to traditional hard drives.</p><p>The rest of the features are identical; the DS423+ uses the same Intel Celeron J4125 as the DS224+, you get 2GB of RAM, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and two USB ports. As it is a larger unit, there are two 92mm fans at the back. I would have liked to see at least one multi-Gigabit port — a lot of other 4-bay servers offer it as standard these days — but other than that, the hardware is pretty decent.</p><p>As the DS423+ uses the same Intel platform, it handles Plex in much the same fashion as the DS224+. I didn&apos;t run into any issues playing back 4K content, and transcoding worked reliably as well. And just like the DS224+, you get the same great feature-set within DSM, allowing you to do so much more in addition to Plex streaming.</p><p>If you like the look of the DS224+ but need M.2 slots or additional drive bays, the DiskStation DS423+ is the ideal choice.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5402T has the best hardware in its category, and the 2-bay NAS has everything you need in a Plex server.

The interface isn&apos;t quite as polished as DSM, and the mobile clients aren&apos;t as refined, but on the whole, ASUSTOR is doing a good job on the software side of things as well.</p><p>The AS5402T has better hardware than other 2-bay servers in this segment, so if that is your main consideration, you&apos;ll find plenty to like with the NAS.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS9xx series has always been a best-seller, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> maintains that streak. The NAS now uses Ryzen hardware in lieu of Intel, and because it doesn&apos;t have an integrated GPU, you lose out on Plex transcoding. So if you absolutely need to use the feature, you should consider the DS423+ instead.</p><p>Although most models in this category have 2.5GbE or even 10GbE, the DS923+ is limited to dual Gigabit Ethernet ports. If you want multi-Gigabit connectivity, you&apos;ll need to pay another $100 to get a 10GbE network card and slot it into the NAS. So why should you consider the NAS? For starters, the AMD hardware is outstanding; it is noticeably faster in daily use, and that makes the DS923+ better-suited for demanding tasks.</p><p>And while you don&apos;t get Plex transcodes, the DS923+ is a standout choice for media streaming. It handles Plex playback without any issues whatsoever, doing a great job with high bitrate content across two devices at the same time. The DSM software is the best around, and because you get 4GB of RAM, you can run virtualization tasks and containers with relative ease.</p><p>There&apos;s also the ability to add more drive bays down the line; the DS923+ has four bays as standard, but you can buy an external housing like the DX517 and connect up to five additional drives to the NAS. It&apos;s this extensibility combined with the powerful hardware that gives it an edge over servers like the DS423+.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS223j doesn&apos;t have powerful hardware, but it still manages to do a great job when it comes to Plex.

As it is an entry-level model, the DS223j doesn&apos;t have any upgradability; the RAM modules are soldered, and you can&apos;t add multi-Gigabit connectivity.</p><p>That said, if you just need an affordable NAS server to store your media collection and back up photos and videos, the DS223j is a good choice to consider. The DSM software is easily the best in this category, and while you don&apos;t get the more advanced features, all the basics are covered.</p>

<p>As a high-level overview, Plex is a free media server utility that catalogs your media collection and makes it available for streaming on all of the connected devices in your home. </p><p>It is often considered to be the best media server around, and there are a few reasons for that. First up is the fact that it&apos;s available on just about any ecosystem: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Android TV, all streaming dongles, and most smart TVs. Basically, you can install Plex on all the devices you own. </p><p>Plex also does a great job with media organization. It sorts your music, movies, and TV shows into relevant categories, and adds high-resolution album art, covers, trailers, and metadata automatically. Also, as the content is streamed locally within your home network, it doesn&apos;t count toward your internet bandwidth costs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-plex-transcode-and-how-does-it-work-2">What is Plex transcode, and how does it work?</h2>
<p>The biggest reason for Plex&apos;s dominance has to do with the fact that it can play any file on any device. Plex has a powerful transcoding service baked in, and if you have the paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/plex-pass">Plex Pass</a> plan, you can unlock hardware acceleration — that makes a huge difference for transcoding 4K files.</p><p>Even if you&apos;re using an iPhone, iPad, Amazon tablet, an older smart TV, or an Android phone, you can confidently play your media library on any device without any issues. Plex handles transcodes automatically, so there&apos;s no intervention needed from your side — and that makes it a fantastic media streaming service. </p><p>Plex streaming generally falls into three categories:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Direct Play</strong>:<strong> </strong>This is when the Plex client (your TV or streaming box) natively handles the video container and just streams the file as-is without any issues. This uses minimal resources. </li><li><strong>Direct Stream</strong>: In this scenario, the client device you're using can play the video and audio streams, but does not work with the container (like .mkv or .m4a), so Plex will copy those streams to a compatible container and send it to your device. This mode uses a few resources, but it isn't demanding on the server. </li><li><strong>Transcode</strong>: This is where things get interesting. Plex will transcode files when a client device is unable to play the video or audio streams at all. This is due to the lack of audio or video codecs (like H.265, HEVC, H.264) on the client device, and in this situation Plex converts the video to a file that can be played on the device. This is the most CPU-intensive option and needs a powerful NAS. </li></ul>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zwiFAa2FkXip8r9xKenRHi" name="synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-14.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS224+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zwiFAa2FkXip8r9xKenRHi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few things you&apos;ll need to pay attention to if you&apos;re interested in a Plex NAS. </p>
<h2 id="cpu-2">CPU</h2>
<p>This is a key consideration when choosing a Plex NAS, as you&apos;ll need a powerful CPU for transcodes. Most servers over $400 meet this criteria, but as a general rule, you&apos;ll need a recent Intel chipset — Celeron models are good for home use, but if you&apos;re sharing your Plex server with friends and family and need more bandwidth, you&apos;ll need to look at servers featuring Intel Core hardware.</p><p>While AMD has made inroads into the NAS category , Intel is still king here. If you want the ability to transcode 4K content in Plex, you&apos;ll need to buy a NAS server with a recent-gen Intel Celeron or Core CPU.</p>
<h2 id="memory-2">Memory</h2>
<p>Basically, you&apos;ll need a decent amount of RAM to make sure there are no bottlenecks. Plex isn&apos;t memory-intensive, but if you have a lot of other services running on the NAS, it could become an issue. Generally, 2GB of RAM is the bare minimum in this category, and if you&apos;re looking to run a lot of services, I&apos;d suggest getting an 8GB memory module and slotting it in. </p><p>Most NAS servers let you upgrade the RAM with ease, so you shouldn&apos;t have any issues slotting in 8GB or more memory within the server should you need it. </p>
<h2 id="connectivity-2">Connectivity</h2>
<p>Most NAS servers have two Gigabit ports as standard, and that should be adequate for home use. But if you&apos;re sharing your Plex instance and need additional bandwidth, you should look at a server with 2.5GbE or even 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. </p><p>That said, if you switch to a NAS with multi-Gigabit connectivity, you&apos;ll need to simultaneously upgrade your switch and router to take full advantage of the additional bandwidth on offer. It isn&apos;t as costly as it used to be to switch to a 10GbE home network, but you&apos;ll have to take those additional costs into consideration. For now, Gigabit Ethernet is more than adequate for handling a few Plex 4K streams without any issues. </p><p>Some NAS models feature an HDMI port that lets you connect the server to a TV or monitor. This is useful as you can then play the media stored on the NAS directly without having to stream it wirelessly on your home network. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-best-plex-server-2">What is the best Plex server?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of options if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best NAS for home</a> use, and you can choose between entry-level picks that have a single or two drive bays, and there are four-bay models that are designed to last. </p><p>But if you&apos;re in the best Plex server, there are a few additional points to consider. For one thing, Plex transcoding is a very CPU-intensive task, so you will need to look at NAS enclosures that have a powerful chipset. Thankfully, the biggest NAS manufacturers — Synology, QNAP, and ASUSTOR — deliver models catered for Plex media streaming. </p><p>Synology&apos;s DiskStation DS224+ illustrates this point perfectly — the two-bay NAS server features the Intel Celeron J4125 and handles Plex native streaming as well as transcoding without breaking a sweat. </p><p>If you want a little more room, the DiskStation DS423+ has four bays that can hold up to 64TB of storage in total. The rest of the features as the same as the DS224+, but you get two M.2 slots. </p>

<p>Right now, if you&apos;re looking to pick up a NAS for Plex streaming, the best option is the DiskStation DS224+. The upgraded internal hardware makes it an enticing model in this category, and with two Gigabit Ethernet ports and robust software features, the NAS has all the basics covered.</p><p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5402T is a really good contender as well, and it delivers the best hardware package in this segment. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3>
<h2 id="our-testing-methodology-for-the-best-plex-server-2">Our testing methodology for the best Plex server</h2>
<p>There are a few things I consider when deciding what NAS servers to recommend for Plex streaming. First up is the CPU; I run a few synthetic tests to determine its performance potential, looking at single and multi-core scores. </p><p>Then I set up a native Plex install on the NAS and run multimedia streaming tests to see resource usage in real-world scenarios when streaming 720p, 1080p, and 4K files on the local network. </p><p>I also evaluate transcoding potential by streaming a 4K file to a device that doesn&apos;t handle the native container — this is a great way to determine if the NAS can handle on-the-fly transcodes for 4K files with high bitrates. </p><p>Finally, I look at sequential read/write potential by transferring an image library containing over 5,000 files (all under 1MB), and a dozen media files over 1GB in size. </p><p>Ultimately, the best Plex server needs to be able to stream your local media library to all devices on your home network (and over the internet), and it should be able to do so consistently for several years. </p><p>All of the NAS models highlighted in this post can do just that, so if you&apos;re looking to get your hands on a Plex NAS server, you can go ahead and pick up any models in this list with confidence. </p>

The phone is a big upgrade from last year’s Razr, which featured a rather small and almost useless cover screen. This year, Motorola is borrowing the same design from the Razr Plus 2023, giving this flip phone a flagship design with a sub-flagship price.</p><p>It was an unexpected move, but Motorola has been full of surprises lately, especially after it upgraded the Razr Plus 2024 with an even larger screen, modern flagship chipset, and better cameras. Similar upgrades have been made with the lower-cost Razr 2024 to bring the cameras, performance, and cover screen experience up to par, giving consumers a rather attractive package for hundreds less than its flagship predecessor and nearly half the cost of the new Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>But what does a $700 flip phone get you in 2024, and should you spring a few hundred more for the full flagship experience? It may not be a simple yes, but this is also a phone you don’t want to overlook if you want something new and fresh.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch">announced</a> in June 2024 alongside the Razr Plus 2024 and went on sale in late July. The phone retails for $699 with only one available configuration in the United States. Pricing may vary depending on the carrier; for example, the phone is available from Cricket Wireless starting at $199. There also may be various deals that will allow you to purchase the device at a lower cost.</p><p>There are three available colorways: Beach Sand, Spritz Orange, and Koala Grey. Availability will depend on the retailer or carrier.</p><p>You can purchase the phone on Motorola.com. In addition to retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy, the phone is available at the following carrier stores: T-Mobile, Consumer Cellular, Xfinity Mobile, Cricket, Spectrum Mobile, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, Visible, Google Fi Wireless, Optimum Mobile, and UScellular.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the Razr 2024 takes its design cues from last year&apos;s Razr flagship, although with a few alterations that give it its own identity. The most noticeable is the bar above the cover screen, which is now a strip of vegan leather that matches the rear, whereas the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> featured an expanded bezel that met the aluminum frame. It seems a little out of place, but I feel this does a good job of minimizing the amount of glass on the front panel, even by just a little bit, while giving the phone a dash of more color when looking at it head-on.</p><p>The color I have is Beach Sand, which is probably the tamest option of the lot. You also get Koala Grey, which has a nice suede feel, and Spritz Orange, which is vibrant and fun. Just like last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr 2023</a>, all models come with vegan leather instead of glass on the back. This feels great in tandem with the matte aluminum frame and means there&apos;s less reason for you to worry about dropping it and cracking something.</p><p>The phone is pretty well built; I&apos;ve dropped it from some great heights onto some hard surfaces, and it&apos;s only managed to get a small ding or two. That said, I would still suggest grabbing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-cases">Razr 2024 case</a>, especially now that Motorola has new cross-body cases available. You should also get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>, particularly to keep that large cover screen safe, but we&apos;ll talk more about that later.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KhiWR9HkWEPmwbykkhYevT" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-09.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 facedown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KhiWR9HkWEPmwbykkhYevT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 6.9-inch OLED display hasn&apos;t changed much and still features a very minimal crease that you can barely see or touch. The resolution is still sharp, the colors are nice and vibrant, and the 120Hz refresh rate keeps things pretty smooth. The peak brightness has been upped to 3,000 nits, which makes it much better to view outdoors than the previous phone, and while the built-in screen protector can still sometimes distort your view a bit, it&apos;s not nearly as bad as it was on the predecessor model.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the hinge. Just like the Razr 2023, the new Razr 2024 has a sturdy hinge, and it similarly feels a tad sturdier than the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. It&apos;s also smaller, but it still holds the phone pretty well in various angles.</p><p>One major upgrade to the Razr 2024 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-2024-waterproof">IPX8 rating</a>, which now allows you to submerge the device underwater fully. We still wouldn&apos;t suggest it, but now you can worry less about getting the phone wet. And while there&apos;s no official dust resistance rating, Motorola has told us that a water resistance rating at this level has some natural dust resistance, so there&apos;s that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="74kWcvamGrLAHsmCve5Wee" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-04.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 open with the display on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/74kWcvamGrLAHsmCve5Wee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr 2024 is powered by the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a> with 8GB of RAM. I was bummed to learn that it didn&apos;t get the bump to 12GB, but it&apos;s a fair compromise at this price point. Regardless, the change from a Snapdragon chip doesn&apos;t seem to have affected the performance of the phone. The Razr handles apps and games quite well, with games like Honkai Star: Rail defaulting to high graphics settings and handling the highest settings without issue. Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis even defaults to Ultra settings, which surprised me a bit.</p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> on board, Motorola&apos;s new Hello UX offers a refreshing take on the company&apos;s flavor of the OS. While it defaults to the same quick settings style as the Pixel, you can change it to a "Modern" Control Center style with access to more toggles with a separate pane for notifications. I much prefer this UI, as I always found the Pixel quick settings menu too limiting with its larger-than-life buttons.</p><p>UI changes mostly extend to the Settings menu, but not much has been changed beyond that aside from the cover screen. You actually get access to some Moto AI features that let you use generative AI to change your wallpaper. This includes Style Sync and Magic Canvas, which can create a new wallpaper from a photo or from a text prompt, although I find these features a bit sub-par compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI wallpapers</a> on other devices.</p><p>Still, it&apos;s enough to get more excited about using Motorola&apos;s software despite its most obvious drawbacks, which I&apos;ll also touch on later. Motorola has also teased additional Moto AI features that have yet to arrive, so we&apos;ll have to see what comes to the Razr 2024 and how well it can handle certain features.</p><p>In the meantime, you still have access to Google features like Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, and more. Unfortunately, not all features are available on the Razr 2024, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which is still limited to Google and Samsung phones.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a>, which this phone borrows its design from, the Razr 2024 has pretty great battery life. the 4,200mAh battery is unchanged from the Razr 2023, and it can get you through the day pretty easily, even if you push the phone a bit. I find if I wake up at 7 a.m., the phone will be on its last leg around 7 p.m., which isn&apos;t bad for a phone that&apos;s getting put through its paces. It&apos;s hard to give an exact number for screen-on time, but it feels substantial enough that this isn&apos;t a phone that should give you battery anxiety.</p><p>On the plus side, you have 30W charging, which isn&apos;t as fast as the 45W you get with the Razr Plus 2024, but when dead, it will hit 50% in half an hour and 100% in <em>just</em> over an hour. And yes, you get 15W wireless charging.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h2oNLkGAXdqmXnmCCkZs7W" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-01.jpg" alt="Apps on the Motorola Razr 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2oNLkGAXdqmXnmCCkZs7W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the larger external display, you&apos;re now free to do much more on the Razr cover screen. The experience is largely similar to how it works on the Razr Plus 2023, but Android 14 brings some nice UI upgrades. The home screen includes app shortcuts and a better UI for customization, panels look a lot nicer, you can now add multiple widgets onto a single panel, and there&apos;s a new pinch gesture that shows you all your available panels for easier navigation.</p><p>With the Razr 2024, you can add up to 12 panels to the cover screen, and it can take some time to set up choosing apps, adding contacts, signing into Spotify, and more.</p><p>Overall, everything is very clean, and the animations are very fluid on the 90Hz display. Using apps also works as you&apos;d expect, although I admit it feels slightly cramped after coming from the Razr Plus 2024, which has a larger 4-inch cover screen. Still, if this is your first flip phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">using apps on the Razr cover screen</a> is a great experience, although navigating the smaller display will take some getting used to.</p><p>Since apps aren&apos;t made with this display size and shape in mind, they&apos;ll appear a bit cramped. However, you can always push things out of the way if the cameras are covering them or simply turn the phone around and flip the UI with the screen rotate button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KEEeh9rAWYygGPQHkqYRKQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-2024-1.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 next to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KEEeh9rAWYygGPQHkqYRKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4146" height="2332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> from the cover screen and Google Photos is also available, although you are limited to just viewing your cloud images and can&apos;t see any other tabs like Library, Memories, or Search. Of course, you can take selfies and use the cover screen to let others preview themselves while you take photos of them, which comes incredibly handy while also resulting in some surprised and impressed reactions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3915px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="3pi5vxEprM7zLbpHe74wqc" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-11.jpg" alt="The Razr 2024 mounted in a car with Google maps on the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3pi5vxEprM7zLbpHe74wqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3915" height="2201" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are also some useful lock screen features you can use with the cover screen, such as Sleep Display and Desk Display, which let you view and/or interact with notifications and media controls when you approach the phone. The latter also acts as a sort of screensaver mode that cycles through images when you&apos;re not using the phone.</p><p>Honestly, you can do nearly anything on the cover screen, to the point where you may not need to open the phone very often. Of course, there are times when opening the phone just works better, but being able to do everything from the smaller display just feels nice.</p>
<p>Before I get into the things I don&apos;t like about the Razr 2024, I will say the biggest downside of using the cover screen appears to be buggy software. When switching from the main display to the cover screen, I find that the cover screen will go blank for some time before finally turning on. I sometimes have to fiddle with the power button or with opening and closing the phone again before I can get the cover screen to behave, which can sour the experience a little.</p><p>This is something I encountered on the Razr Plus 2024, but it seems to be more prevalent on the Razr 2024, so I really hope this can be addressed with a future update.</p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to fault what&apos;s technically a mid-range phone for its compromises, especially one like this. After all, something gotta give if you&apos;re paying $700 for a foldable phone. Unfortunately, that was the camera experience.</p><p>Motorola upgraded the Razr 2024 camera with a 50MP primary sensor, while retaining a 13MP ultrawide camera. I was excited about this because I was fairly impressed with the new 50MP sensor on the Razr Plus 2024 and was expecting a similar image output and a more versatile experience with the ultrawide. At least I got one of those.</p><p>Images from the Razr 2024 are... fine. That is, when the phone isn&apos;t being temperamental. Using the camera can sometimes be a sluggish experience, slowing the phone to a crawl that really takes the fun out of taking a photo. It&apos;s almost surprising, given how well the rest of the phone performs, but the viewfinder frame rate will become so choppy that I eventually give up taking a photo out of sheer embarrassment or annoyance.</p>

<p>Even when the camera is working fine, images sometimes feel a bit overprocessed. Don&apos;t get me wrong; the Razr is capable of taking a good photo with good contrast, plenty of light, and balanced colors, but more often than not, the camera will punch the saturation to offensive levels that make me and my friends cringe. There also seems to be a lot of oversharpening, and the phone feels like it&apos;s overcompensating. Overall, it&apos;s a bit inconsistent.</p><p>You can see this in this image comparison between the Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024, where the latter phone really pushes the saturation to the next level.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=4fec7860-53a1-11ef-9396-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>In this comparison between the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Razr 2024, images from Samsung are also much softer, while the Razr tends to try and get as much detail as possible, which can make the images look a bit artificial.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=d3b67178-53a1-11ef-9396-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>Ultrawide photos also suffer from the same processing woes, but that&apos;s compounded by the narrower field of view, at least compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. On the plus side, you get less distortion this way, but I always find having a wider field of view gives you a bit more incentive to use the camera.</p>
<p>But as I said, the camera isn&apos;t always bad, but I really hope Motorola can iron things out with some software updates. You do get the Auto Camcorder mode, which is a neat feature, but you do miss out on the Moto AI-powered Action Shot feature, which comes in pretty handy with fast-moving subjects. </p><p>When it comes to audio, the Razr 2024 supports dual stereo speakers, but I find the sound quite unbalanced, and the top speaker sounds noticeably quieter than the bottom speaker. Unfortunately, this bothers me much more than it should, and I opt to listen to music on my headphones when I can.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LMcKMpMqZjYbBDFQftWoHA" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-03.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 open, display off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMcKMpMqZjYbBDFQftWoHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Motorola has the same software promise for the Razr 2024, with three OS upgrades and four years of software updates, but the company has not proven that it&apos;s getting much better with its updates. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-14-is-finally-coming-to-the-motorola-razr-and-razr-plus-and-it-only-took-a-year">the Razr Plus 2023 received Android 14 in July 2024</a>, long after just about every other Android OEM pushed the update to their flagship and even midrange phones. Keep in mind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is right around the corner.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping Motorola can do better than just providing regular bi-monthly updates and actually push substantial updates in a more timely manner, but we&apos;ll have to see when Android 15 drops.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-2024-competition"><span>Motorola Razr 2024: Competition</span></h2>

<p>There aren&apos;t many sub-$1000 foldables stateside, so competition for the Razr 2024 is slim with options such as the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Nubia Flip 5G. That said, you may be able to find additional options from companies like TECNO with the Phantom V Flip if you live in a region where it&apos;s sold.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a flagship-level foldable, so you will have to be ready to spend nearly twice as much to buy one. The phone comes with the latest Snapdragon processor, tons of new AI features, and a pretty decent 50MP camera, although the battery is slightly smaller, and the cover screen experience isn&apos;t as robust, making you go through hoops to set up apps.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> costs a little less than the Razr 2024 and has a rather nice design with a circular cover screen. However, that $499 price comes at a price, and you&apos;re sacrificing features like wireless charging, an IP rating, and polished software. You also get a very limited cover screen experience courtesy of the small, rounded external display.</p><p>But if neither of these tickles your fancy, you could also spring for the admittedly older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, which is still a good phone. However, you may need to seek out deals as Samsung appears to have retained its $999 retail price.</p>

<p>Even though the Razr 2024 is a mid-range version of last year&apos;s Razr Plus 2023, it doesn&apos;t feel like a downgrade. If anything, it feels more like a sidestep, keeping everything that was great about the 2023 flagship while addressing some of the pain points like battery life. Unfortunately, some of the upgrades, like the camera, don&apos;t necessarily translate to actual improvements, although the Razr Plus 2023 camera was pretty bad in its own way.

But in the foldable space, camera quality can be pretty hit or miss and not always as good as the more traditional candy bar counterparts (with some exceptions).</p><p>The Razr 2024 still has a lot going for it, and I&apos;m a big fan of how Motorola handles the cover screen, giving you a better experience than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> on the market. You also get impressive displays, great overall performance, and respectable battery life. There&apos;s little more you can ask for in a phone.</p><p>Yes, the Razr 2024 is far from perfect, but this is a good flip phone at a great price that will get the job done for many people who would rather not spend an arm and a leg on Samsung&apos;s latest iterative Z Flip 6.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>The affordable foldable</strong></em></p>
<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 is one of the cheapest ways to get a foldable phone while offering performance you might expect from a flagship device. It comes with a great set of displays, a 50MP dual camera sensor, and all-day battery life, while letting you use nearly any app from the cover screen. All this for nearly half of what you'd pay for a new Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p></p>

<p>The creation of the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) opened the door to better compatibility when it comes to using a stylus on a Chromebook. While many Chromebooks support the peripheral, only a handful come with a built-in stylus that travels with the computer at all times. If you&apos;re buying this for a student, a loose stylus is just another thing to get lost at the bottom of a backpack.</p><p>Getting the best Chromebook with a stylus included makes it so you don&apos;t have to search for one after the fact, and you have everything you need out of the box. If you&apos;re confused about choosing one, here are all the best ones based on factors like your budget, battery life, or simply the best one all around!</p>

<p>What do you get when you pair reliable hardware with excellent internals and an included stylus? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714</a> is the answer, which was revamped in 2022, complete with Intel&apos;s 12th Gen chipsets and Iris Xe graphics. With the Spin 714, Acer actually remedied a few of the complaints we&apos;ve had with some of the best Chromebooks. Although the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023)</a> is now out, the newer iteration does not come with a stylus anymore. Therefore, the 2022 variant continues to be the best Chromebook that comes with a stylus.</p><p>Not only is Intel&apos;s Core i5 chipset paired with 8GB of RAM more than enough power to handle practically everything. But it also sports a wonderful display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, along with plenty of ports, including multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/intel-thunderbolt-4-official-8k-display">Thunderbolt 4</a> ports. The star of the show with the Spin 714 is the garaged USI stylus that is found at the edge of the bottom casing. This makes it easy to grab the stylus when you want to flip over into tablet mode or if you need to sign a document quickly.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, having a garaged stylus removes the need to worry about losing your Chromebook stylus. While it&apos;s not exactly the most comfortable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI stylus</a> we&apos;ve used, we&apos;re big fans of the convenience provided by being housed right in the chassis. Now, you can just download your favorite note-taking apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chrome-os-102-release">Google Cursive</a> or Nebo, take the stylus out of the slot, and start hand-writing your notes from anywhere without trying to find exactly where you put your stylus.</p>

<p>Chromebooks have become as essential to learning as textbooks in many schools, but kids aren’t known for their careful treatment of electronics. The Asus Chromebook Flip CR1 is designed to handle a few drops, or to survive being sandwiched between books without breaking. Even so, the hinge can fold all the way back so you can use the Flip CR1 like a standard laptop, or like a tablet. The USI 1.0 stylus has a garage in the computer chassis, so it’s less likely to get lost.</p><p>The power is nothing special with an Intel Celeron N5100 CPU with four cores, but at least you can get this laptop with up to 8GB of RAM. Storage is just 32GB, so you may also want to pick up a microSD card if you need to save a lot of files locally. Wi-Fi 6 is supported for quick internet speeds, and if you’re on the go a lot, you can also get it with LTE 4G capability.</p><p>When it comes to the screen, it’s not going to blow you away with a fairly dim 250nits 1366x768 panel. Still, at 11.6 inches, it should still be fine for school work. Just make sure you pick the right version as there are models with and without the stylus and touch support.</p>

<p>The Chromebook Vibe CX34 is a fairly powerful laptop with a Core i5 CPU, and a USI 1.0 garaged stylus. This laptop folds all the way back so you can use it on a desk like a traditional laptop or folded back like a tablet. Whether you’re typing, taking handwritten notes, or watching videos, this Chromebook has the right form factor.</p><p>While it’s still packing an older 12th generation Intel CPU, the Core i5-1235U is fairly capable processor with eight efficient cores and two performance cores. You can get it with 8GB or 16GB of RAM, but if you plan to game, you should get the 16GB version. It’s also got Intel Iris Xe graphics, so it’s got enough power for basic 3D gaming. Even so, with Wi-Fi 6E support, you’ll likely find a better selection of games with cloud gaming, but this is a supported device for Steam for Chromebook. Just be sure your favorites games are supported on Chrome OS before ditching your Windows machine.</p><p>Luckily, the screen on this PC is nice with a high-resolution 1920x1200 monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate. It has one USB-A port and two USB-C ports for peripherals. There’s also an HDMI port so you can plug it into a TV or monitor without any adapters.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a small Chromebook for work or study, the Acer Chromebook Spin 512 could be a good pick with a 12-inch display. It has a 1366x912 resolution, which means a fairly tall 3:2 aspect ration. That’s a better design from reading through documents and web pages, but will have black bars at the top and bottom when watching video content. Naturally, the included garaged USI-compatible stylus gives means you can take notes or easily swipe through documents.</p><p>Running an Intel N200 CPU, this computer isn’t going to top any benchmark leaderboards, but it’s capable enough for most people. Using Intel’s confusingly names 10nm Intel 7 lithography, this four-core CPU sips power while still supporting DDR5 RAM, which the Spin 512 has 8GB of. For storage, 64GB is included which should be enough for most people, but if you need more, microSD cards are also supported.</p><p>If you’re looking to connect some peripherals, there are two USB-A ports and two USB-C ports with 5Gbps speeds. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E, so you should have no trouble getting plenty of network speed on this Chromebook, provided you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wi-fi-routers">good Wi-Fi router</a>.</p>

<p>To be quite honest, whenever a new Chromebook comes across our desk, it&apos;s definitely a bit odd to find the ones that don&apos;t include stylus support. However, not every Chromebook includes a stylus in the box. Even if you pick a model with a built-in stylus, make sure you&apos;re getting the right one as you&apos;ll often find identical-looking Chromebooks without the stylus.</p><p>Because there aren&apos;t very many options if you want a Chromebook that includes a stylus, it makes the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 even more appealing. Not only does it offer incredible performance, but the stylus is also always with you, removing the need to empty your bag just to find it. Plus, you&apos;re getting a powerful i5 processor that can keep up with just about anything Chrome OS can throw at it, and can even do a little gaming.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for something cheap for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">taking notes in class</a>, the Asus Chromebook Flip CR1 keeps things basic with a simple but tough design. This computer folds all the way flat so you can take notes by hand with sketches if that works better for you. </p>

<ul><li>Google has started rolling out its "Collections" tab in Photos, which replaces the old library option.</li><li>The tab swaps the "Photos on device" carousel for a folder and pops in more organization for cloud-stored photos in an "Album."</li><li>This Photos update (once again) shifts the Locked Folder by dropping it down to the bottom of the Collections tab, following user feedback.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The previously discovered "Collections" redesign for Google Photos is rolling out, bringing major changes to how your photos are organized.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/08/google-photos-library-collections-redesign/">9to5Google</a>, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/289829291/introducing-the-collections-view-find-what-you-need-faster">announced</a> its new Collections tab, which lets users "access private and shared albums, all under one roof." Now, Photos offers an Albums folder containing both local and cloud folders of files, personal and shared.</p><p>Users will also find a "Sort by" option in this new Albums folder. The publication found that the old library "Photos on device" carousel has been replaced with a new "On this device" folder.</p><p>Instead of swiping horizontally for memories captured via your camera, apps, or screenshots, "On this device" expands into a grid view of available albums.</p><p>Google added that it wants to "streamline" the way users rediscover their content with this new UI redesign. Collections has Favorites and Trash folders on the top, followed by other themed folders like "People & Pets," "Places," and "Documents." The Photos&apos; Locked Folder will no longer have its pill-shaped button in the open.</p><p>Users can now find their sensitive items listed at the bottom of the Collections page. Lastly, the Search tab has reportedly gained a list view for recent queries and memory suggestions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:543px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:110.50%;"><img id="aWTmmfCNHvdfiQr8iwtPkh" name="google-photos-collection-tab-rolls-out.jpg" alt="Google started rolling out its new "Collection" tab redesign for the Photos app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aWTmmfCNHvdfiQr8iwtPkh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="543" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "Suggested" area in the Collections tab drops the Utilities folders. Users will have to search elsewhere for options like "Free up Space," which can be found by tapping their account icon.</p><p>Google Photos&apos; new Collections tab to replace Library is rolling out today (August 8) across Android and iOS. The company states that users should see the update soon, and if not, check back "over the coming weeks."</p><p>What&apos;s interesting about the subtle change to the locked folder in Photos is Google made it a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-now-lets-you-whip-out-your-hidden-pictures-faster"> bit easier to access</a> early in July. The company removed the necessity of digging through your Utilities folder to find your locked contents. After the update, the user could find their locked folder as an option in the suggestion section alongside their favorites and archives.</p><p>However, as the publication notes, it seems this shift (again) with the Collections tab was due to user feedback.</p><p>In other news, we&apos;re still waiting on Google to roll out "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini">Ask Photos</a>" powered by Gemini. The tool will let users find a specific photo in their collection of memories through text-based queries to the AI model.</p>

No trade-in required!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7fa18990-fe40-4900-92b1-11e5efc42a12" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phones</a> with AI features and an AMOLED 120Hz display; you&apos;re already a Verizon customer or willing to switch.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you like to buy your phones unlocked; you&apos;re hoping to find a trade-in deal. </p><p>Of course, I don&apos;t need to tell you that nothing is <em>truly</em> free when it comes to smartphone deals. Like I mentioned above, you&apos;ll need to add a line with one of Verizon&apos;s unlimited plans to get the promo credit, and those don&apos;t always come cheap. </p><p>If you want the free S24, the best value would be to sign up for the Unlimited Plus plan, which starts at $80 per month for a single line (before any multi-line discounts are applied). That last detail is important, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> are most tempting when you&apos;re adding multiple lines: you can drop the price of the Unlimited Plus plan to just $45 per month when you add four lines, for example. </p><p>The Unlimited Plus plan gives you access to Verizon&apos;s vast 5G Ultra Wideband network with 30GB of premium mobile hotspot data and discounts on home internet. And that&apos;s before you add any of Verizon&apos;s premium add-ons for $10 per month. These optional perks include things like Disney Plus streaming and TravelPass credits, and you&apos;re given the option to mix and match every month without a penalty. </p><p>Needless to say, if you don&apos;t want to change your wireless plan or you prefer buying phones unlocked, skip this deal. But if you&apos;re looking to upgrade anyway and the small-but-mighty Samsung Galaxy S24 seems appealing to you, don&apos;t miss this opportunity from Verizon. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Reports pile up about Russia's apparent throttle of home network speeds for users attempting to access YouTube.</li><li>It seems that speeds drop to around 128Kbps when accessing YouTube, which is not suitable for streaming video.</li><li>Russia and Google have butt heads before, especially when the country blocked Google News for reportedly containing "unreliable" information.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Russian authorities have reportedly crippled YouTube download speeds in the country, forcing a near-complete outage.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/thousands-youtube-outages-reported-russia-2024-08-08/">Reuters</a> first reported the outage, claiming that the country has "stepped up criticism of the platform." It seems that users have been encountering issues with accessing YouTube for the past few weeks. Russia initially blamed Google for the slow speeds, which the company promptly disputed.</p><p>Since the outage, users in the country have been able to access YouTube through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">VPN</a>, but not natively through their internet service provider (ISP). The publication states that its staff in the area can&apos;t access YouTube; however, the service is still accessible on "some" handheld devices.</p><p>Another report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/08/06/russian-authorities-inform-local-internet-service-providers-that-most-youtube-access-is-now-capped-at-a-piddling-128-kbps">Meduza</a> states Russia&apos;s authorities had slowed YouTube&apos;s speeds to 128Kbps (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtube-outage-hits-russia-after-country-throttles-loading-speeds">PCMag</a>). The publication adds that the sheer throttling of network speeds was suitable for listening purposes, but attempting to stream videos was futile. Additional information stems from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/retailrus/14547">Telegram channel</a> that reportedly confirmed that "state authorities" are responsible for YouTube&apos;s crawl and not Google.</p><p>Concern has risen about whether or not the full fleet of Google&apos;s services will meet a similar fate in the future. Even though this isn&apos;t a textbook outage, most users in Russia cannot enjoy YouTube, given the slow home internet speed.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for comment about YouTube&apos;s outage in Russia but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>A YouTube spokesperson provided the following statement to Android Central regarding the issues with YouTube in Russia.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>"We are aware of reports of some people not being able to access YouTube in Russia. That is not as a result of any technical issues on our side or action taken by us."</p><figcaption><cite>YouTube spokesperson</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>Russia and Google have butted heads before, as the country&apos;s officials <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/russia-blocks-google-news-for-allegedly-giving-access-to-unreliable-information">blocked Google News</a> for "unreliable" information reasons. Users in the area lost access to the news aggregate website due to "materials" about Russia&apos;s military conflict with Ukraine. Despite Google&apos;s attempts to keep information freely available to users, the company confirmed that its unavailability wasn&apos;t due to technical problems.</p><p>Other issues include Russia&apos;s ban on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/russia-bans-facebook-from-operating-in-the-country">Facebook and Twitter (now X)</a> alongside reports of officials <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/russia-forces-netflix-to-stream-state-owned-channels">"forcing" Netflix</a> to show specific programming. Reports stated Netflix was required to register to the country&apos;s "audio-visual services," which prompted the necessity of offering 20 state-owned channels. Netflix was also barred from displaying content that included "extremism."</p>

<p>You can purchase the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs directly from Sennheiser for $1,499.98. You can also find it from retailers like B&H Photo and Best Buy, and during the most recent Prime Day sales, it could be found on Amazon for close to $900.</p><p>Matter of fact, if you wait on Amazon, the IE900s have gone on sale a few times, even dropping as low as $999.95 in June of 2023. If I had money just sitting somewhere for a large-ish tech purchase, I’d jump on that immediately, then build a shrine in my home to store them when not in use.</p>

<p>If you couldn’t tell already, I like everything about my experience with the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs. Their chassis is beautifully designed, even though it’s what’s inside that counts. It’s hard to make something so small look “worth” $1,500, but they definitely put their best foot forward as they are beautifully machined and look like art pieces up close.</p><p>There have been times when I’ve reviewed a product and felt like it should’ve come with more accessories in the box for the price it was retailing for. With some premium-priced products, I’ve found myself asking, “Why do I need to buy an additional ______ at x price point?” Not with the IE900s.</p>

<p>In the box, you get 2.5mm/3.5mm/4.4mm para-aramid reinforced gold-plated MMCX cables (Kevlar is a type of para-aramid), a premium hard case, silicone and memory foam ear tips (S, M, L), and cleaning tools. Your bases are covered unless you want to be very particular and look for a 3.5mm-to-1/4-inch adapter.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about the most important aspect: how the IE900s sound. I used them with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">few different mobile DACs</a> and one desktop DAC, as I’ve been testing a few for a roundup. Like a fine wine, IEMs may pair better with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">some DACs than others</a>. My favorite pairings were the iFi GO bar Kensei, iFi GO blu, and Qudelix-5K for its high-quality PEQ.</p><p>Listening to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga (Main Title) from the “Get Out” OST is—at the risk of overusing the word— transcendent. The Ladysmith Black Mombazo acapella intro to “Diamonds” is gleefully airy, while “Sikiliza” is hauntingly ethereal with its heavy, ominous vocals. I can make out the pull and tension of the bow across the strings and the attack with the change in chords and movements as I listen to “Violin Duel” from the Chevalier OST. Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” is a masterclass in engineering, in layering instrumentation in a stereo image, brought fully to life in living color through the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs.</p><p>With its transparent, balanced sound, everything I throw at the IE900s through the iFi GO blu and iFi GO bar Kensei is an absolute delight! That said, audiophiles might tell you that an IEM like this isn’t for bass heads. They’d be wrong. Very, very wrong.</p><p>On its own, the bass produced by the IE900s is well-balanced and tightly controlled but won’t leave your brain rattled. Some of us musical masochists like that, though. Bring on the bass cannon!</p>

<p>With that in mind (pun intended), I plugged the IE900s into the 2.5mm balanced output of the Qudelix-5K, which was connected via USB-C to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 7 Pro.</a> Then, I went to the app’s 10-band parametric EQ, boosting the 36 and 63Hz bands by 5.5dB and achieving bass head Nirvana. I was glowing like Bruce Leroy as I bathed in the tight, soul-stirring bass and sub-bass of Skrillex&apos;s “Mumbai Power” and revisited the swinging upright bass in Mingus’ “Moanin’.” </p><p>As balanced as the IE900 is, the X3R TrueResponse transducer showed no fear when eating the hyped low-end curve I sat in front of it. Unlike some multi-driver IEMs, the IE900 has one dynamic driver that sits inside the X3R triple-chambers milled into the aluminum housings. This technological witchcraft allows the bass to be hyped up to nuclear levels without compromising clarity and detail in the other frequencies.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tbnovdaQenDfANxqLr3hxK" name="sennheiser-ie900-exploded.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE900 IEM exploded view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tbnovdaQenDfANxqLr3hxK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sennheiser)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of frequencies and technical odds and ends, let’s take a moment and talk about what Sennheiser did with their single driver. It’s quite difficult to get balanced sound coming out of one speaker in a pair of IEMs. That’s why other manufacturers will cram multiple units inside those housings; different speakers for highs, lows, etc. But then you’re faced with the problem of having sounds butting up against each other like that, and you run into issues of phase coherence, which in English means two or more sounds running into each other and causing echo or tonal weirdness. That’s a very rudimentary explanation, but I think it gets the point across.</p><p>That said, when you use just one driver, you still run into some issues. To combat the potential for that single driver to have your mids and lows running together and a lack of detail and clarity in the overall sound, their engineers add a small chamber within a chamber inside the IEM housing. Something called a “back volume.” What this does is control the direction and overall volume of air as it moves through the transducer system while killing any fatiguing resonance as sound attempts to bounce around that chamber.</p><p>For those of you into cars and speaker systems, the small chambers of the IEMs are a very technical, precision-crafted “speaker box” of sorts.</p>

<p>There wasn’t anything I didn’t like about the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs (and for $1500, there better not be!), but there is something some users may not care about if they’re primarily using these with a mobile device like a smartphone. There’s no inline mic cable in the box. </p><p>You can pick up a replacement cable specifically for the IE900 that has an inline microphone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LgcwoBvF6o4iBf7f6XZMXA" name="Shure-SE846.jpg" alt="Shure SE846 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgcwoBvF6o4iBf7f6XZMXA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shure)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At, or around this price point, there are definitely some options for your listening pleasure. With sound being such a highly subjective experience, the issue is going to be deciding which option is best for you!</p><p>Technics EAH-TZ700 are solid performers that are more forgiving with dodgy recordings and lower resolution Spotify streams but less insightful when it comes to great recordings. Then there’s the Campfire Audio Andromeda ‘Emerald Sea’ with its five dual-diaphragm balanced armatures. It competes really well with the IE900, though you may find a bit more detail in the top end of the high frequencies and the lowest end of the low frequencies.</p><p>There’s also the Shure SE846 Gen 2 True Wireless bundle. They’re actually just at $1k but they sound magnificent and come with a bundle that makes them wireless enabled.</p>

<p>I’m completely infatuated with the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs. Their clarity, detail, and ability to eat up EQ like a champion hot dog eater make them a great pair for active recreational listening and for analytical inspection. </p><p>They come with enough extras in the box to cover whatever you decide to hook them up to, and fit shouldn’t be a problem, with enough ear tip options for the most finicky of ear canals. I highly recommend them...if you have the money to spare.</p>

<ul><li>Ayaneo has announced its latest Android handheld, the Pocket EVO. </li><li>The Pocket EVO is the first of its kind to feature an OLED display, while also sporting a 120Hz refresh rate. </li><li>Pre-orders for the Pocket EVO are available now, through Indiegogo, ahead of an official release later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After being teased in early July and introduced a week later, the Ayaneo Pocket EVO is officially available for pre-order. Ayaneo has been on a roll, as the company also recently launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">Pocket DMG and Pocket Micro</a> gaming handhelds. However, the Pocket EVO is entirely different.</p><p>On the surface, it&apos;s not all that different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">Pocket S</a> that was released earlier this year. The Pocket EVO is powered by the same Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 SoC, while also offering another option if you enjoy the horizontal form factor. </p><p>However, Ayaneo is implementing a secret "sauce." Though it&apos;s different from the Pocket S, the Pocket EVO <em>isn&apos;t</em> a brand-new design. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6f7gBShHjRk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Ayaneo has been in the handheld space for a few years now, but the primary focus has been on devices running Windows. Following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">partnership with Qualcomm</a> for the G3x Gen 2, we&apos;ve seen a steady stream of Android devices, culminating with the Pocket EVO. </p><p>However, there&apos;s a bit of cross-pollination taking place, as Ayaneo&apos;s latest device borrows much of its design from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-2s-review-an-impressive-gaming-handheld-with-a-price-thats-hard-to-swallow">Ayaneo 2S</a>. This is a Windows handheld released in May 2023, which offers an alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>What this means for the Pocket EVO is an ergonomic and comfortable design, paired with "x86-level active cooling." Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handhelds</a> tend to rely on passive cooling, which can result in subpar performance if your device gets too hot. By implementing active cooling, performance degradation shouldn&apos;t be an issue, as it&apos;s not like you&apos;ll be able to play more demanding titles like PC games.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2212px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="TuWbi6u9zmYTCVvLgRsFTd" name="ayaneo-pocket-evo-official-lifestyle-logo.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket EVO official render logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TuWbi6u9zmYTCVvLgRsFTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2212" height="1244" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While all of that is great to see, the star of the show is the 7-inch OLED "borderless" display. Surprisingly, there has yet to be a dedicated Android handheld released with an OLED display, but hopefully, this will disrupt the market a bit. The closest that we&apos;ve gotten so far is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini">AYN Odin 2 Mini</a>, which uses a MiniLED display and is two inches smaller than the EVO.</p><p>Ayaneo also points out that along with the 120Hz refresh rate and OLED panel, this handheld also supports HDR and is capable of reaching up to 800 nits of brightness. While that might pale in comparison to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, it&apos;s a big step up from the handheld competition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yf4m7bdEBHUZGao5ws5v2d" name="ayaneo-pocket-evo-official-lifestyle-gameplay.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket EVO gameplay lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yf4m7bdEBHUZGao5ws5v2d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for configurations and availability, there are a total of five different options to choose from. These start with the base model, consisting of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage while maxing out at 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. </p><p>Much like we&apos;ve seen from Ayaneo&apos;s other device launches, you can jump on the pre-order train today by heading over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-evo-world-s-first-7-oled-android-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a>. Early Bird pricing starts at $389 for the 8GB/128GB model, going all the way up to $639 for the 24GB/1TB version. </p><p>However, you might not want to wait too long, as the pricing will jump a bit after the Early Bird units are sold out, and then again when the handheld is released. Speaking of which, there will be a bit of a wait, as the Pocket EVO launch event is scheduled for "the middle of September," with "global shipping" to commence in "Early November."</p>
