<ul><li>A new Samsung patent has reportedly been spotted, detailing a more personal AI summarization feature for Galaxy AI.</li><li>The patent users would be able to tell the AI how long or short they'd like the summary to be and what tone of voice it should use.</li><li>The AI would base its informational responses on a user's search history, preferences, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information has surfaced regarding a new Galaxy AI feature Samsung is currently developing.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2024/03/18/FBLRRYLHZ5ANBBHWO3A5ZXWWHQ/">ChosunBiz</a> (Korean), Â Samsung has submitted a patent to the South Korean government detailing an upgraded AI summarization feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-ai-features-are-coming-with-next-gen-foldable-phones/">SamMobile</a>). The KIPRIS patent system states Samsung has designed this feature to provide a more personalized summary experience.</p><p>The AI is said to examine a user&apos;s "usage history" to provide answers appropriately. The patent reportedly adds that the AI will take into account a user&apos;s preference, level of knowledge on various subjects, and more. Additionally, the AI will understand a user&apos;s interests and "non-interests" by using their search history.</p><p>Users may also be able to customize how the AI provides a summary on a given topic. The publication states that Samsung aims for users to tell the AI how long they&apos;d like the summary to be and its tone of voice. An example the Korean OEM provided in its patent reads, "please summarize in a long and negative tone."</p><p>Speculation states Samsung could roll out this new feature on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 later this year. Only time will tell, as this could simply be a feature Samsung playtests but never releases for consumers.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting about this "enhanced" AI summarization is that Samsung already rolled out a version of this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. The Galaxy S24 series can summarize lengthy pieces of text, like a document or web page, for users. However, the patent details a feature that may bring a new level of customization to users.</p><p>We&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s23-march-security-patch-2024">still waiting for</a> several Galaxy AI features to arrive on Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices, like the S23 series. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-features-coming-to-older-galaxy-phones">detailed its plans</a> to do so back in January, stating users will gain Circle to Search, live translation, Chat Assist, and the current summary feature. These are slated to arrive with its One UI 6.1 update, which still has yet to roll out.</p><p>If Samsung plans to release this feature in its next clamshell, it could happen in July. A rumor at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">the end of February</a> suggested as much and also purported Samsung could hold its event in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Google has started pushing a server-side update for Maps that brings its public transit directions to Wear OS 3 or above devices.</li><li>Users can search for a place and find navigation methods like driving, walking, trains, and more.</li><li>Maps will offer "recommended routes" and all routes, letting users decide which they prefer, along with the steps they'll need to take.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is beginning its rollout of a new feature in Maps that should give users hands-free directions.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/google-maps-wear-os-transit-directions/">9to5Google</a>, Google Maps&apos; latest update is rolling out today (Mar. 19) as a server-side update as part of version 11.119.0702 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS</a>. Users can now search for a place on their watch and find directions for different methods of public transportation. Maps will display options for walking, driving, trains, and more.</p><p>Once you&apos;re ready to navigate, users can decide between Maps&apos; "recommended routes" or all available routes.</p><p>Tapping on either will expand a list of ways users can reach their destination with information on train times and more. A "Preview Route" option awaits users in a route&apos;s list of steps, letting you see every train stop and which is yours before selecting it.</p><p>The publication states Google Maps&apos; new public transit directions Wear OS&apos; tile to start navigating to "Home" or "Work." Additionally, exiting Maps&apos; new public transit directions will display a train icon at the bottom of your watch face. Tapping this sends you back to the app for an update on where you&apos;re going.</p><p>As this is a server-side update, it may take a little while for your Wear OS 3 device or above to display the new feature.</p>

<p>Google briefly highlighted Wear OS&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-highlights-android-updates-mwc-2024">public transit directions</a> in Maps during MWC 2024. The company stated users could mirror directions they&apos;ve started looking at on their phone to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> or other Wear OS device for a hands-free experience. Wear OS&apos; update for Maps will likely work well with the Android app&apos;s public transit update, which rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-public-transit-emoji-update">in November</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, this was one of a few updates we&apos;ve been waiting on for Wear OS ever since Google detailed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-devices-get-march-feature-drop">March feature drop</a>. Original Pixel Watch owners received some Watch 2 features like Pace training, heart zone training, and the auto workout mode. The Fitbit Relax app also made its way to the first-gen watch, bringing with it guided breathing exercises for a wellness break.</p>

<ul><li>Today (Mar. 19), Google appointed Liz Reid as its new head of Search.</li><li>Reid has a history of working with AI, specifically in Search, through Search Labs' SGE (search generative experience).</li><li>Reid stated she wants to implement more "SGE" and AI overviews into Google Search as the company improves its capability of understanding context-rich queries.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (Mar. 19), Google has a new head of Search who will take the reigns to "shape the future."</p><p>Announced via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elizabeth-reid-56356724_today-im-taking-on-a-new-role-leading-search-activity-7175645922851262465-oYX6/">LinkedIn</a> post, Liz Reid is Google&apos;s new head of Search, and one of her primary goals is to plug more AI into the product (via TheVerge). Reid has been with Google since 2003, and the bulk of her work involved Search&apos;s AI, known as its "Search Generative Experience" (SGE) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-food-restaurants-multisearch-integration">multisearch</a>.</p><p>Reid states that we&apos;ve entered an "exciting time" for Search as user positivity behind queries reportedly grows in Google&apos;s "major markets." During her time with the company, she mentioned some of the features Search has recently gained, such as Google Lens (visual search), Circle to Search, and SGE&apos;s AI overviews.</p><p>AI will lead Search further, as Reid states, "with SGE, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including more complex questions, like comparisons or longer queries." She teases, "More coming soon!"</p><p>The publication recounted a discussion with Reid before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-opens-access-to-search-labs">Search Labs</a> launched in 2023, during which she mentioned "lowering the bar to asking Google your real questions." Essentially, Google is looking to AI to help its Search experience better understand context-rich queries and produce responses.</p><p>In addition to Reid&apos;s new position, Cheenu Venkatachary is now overseeing Google Search&apos;s ranking and quality. Google News and Discover&apos;s Cathy Edwards is now said to have joined the company&apos;s long-term bets team.</p>

<p>SGE&apos;s colorful text boxes were shown alongside Search Labs&apos; introduction in 2023. Google said SGE would scour the web for the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-opens-access-to-search-labs"> most relevant answers</a> before allowing users to dive deeper with alternatives. However, AI is prone to hallucinations, which pushed Google to start testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-source-linking-generative-ai-search">source links for SGE</a>. Enrolled testers discovered in-line links to where the company&apos;s AI gathered the information so users could fact-check it.</p><p>Most recently, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">AI overviews</a> started arriving in its main Android app for all users. In addition to multisearch, users can snap a photo of an item they&apos;re unsure about and run it through Google&apos;s engine for a complete breakdown. Much like Reid is interested in bringing more AI to Search, so is Google.</p><p>The company stated it will look to roll out SGE experiments "more broadly" to users regardless of their enrollment in Search Labs. Google adds this should help it understand what users need.</p>

<hr>
<p>Microsoft announced on Tuesday (Mar.19) that it has hired Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of Google DeepMind, to lead its consumer AI division.</p><p>As spotted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105900/google-deepmind-microsoft-mustafa-suleyman-ai-ceo">Verge</a>, Suleman took to X to announce his new role, stating that "Iâll be leading all consumer AI products and research, including Copilot, Bing, and Edge." According to the post, Suleyman will also serve as executive vice president of Microsoft AI and join the companyâs senior leadership team.Â </p><p>Suleyman co-founded DeepMind in 2010, which Google later acquired in 2014.Â Suleyman was also involved in a controversy in 2019, after which Google placed him on leave. Later, he was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/28/mustafa-suleyman-deepmind-co-founder-quits-google-ai-role-to-be-vc.html">appointed</a> Google&apos;s vice president of AI product management and AI police.Â </p><p>In 2022, Suleyman departed Google and co-founded a startup called Inflection AI, which he says will "continue on its mission under a new CEO and look to reach more people than ever by making its API widely available to developers and businesses the world over."</p>

<p>Microsoft&apos;s CEO Satya Nadala also sent out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/03/19/mustafa-suleyman-deepmind-and-inflection-co-founder-joins-microsoft-to-lead-copilot/">memo</a> to his employees announcing the recent addition to the AI table.Â </p><p>"This is about science, engineering, product, and design coming together and embracing a learning mindset to push our innovation culture and product-building process forward in fundamental ways."</p><p>Nadala confirmed that Suleyman and KarÃ©n Simonyan, also from AI Inflection, will join Microsoft to form a new organization called Microsoft AI. This organization will focus on advancing Copilot and other consumer AI products and research. "Mustafa will be EVP and CEO of Microsoft AI and join the senior leadership team (SLT), reporting to me. KarÃ©n is joining this group as Chief Scientist, reporting to Mustafa," he added.</p><p>This move came after Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-hired-chatgpt-ceo-president">tried to hire OpenAI&apos;s CEOs</a>, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, to lead its AI team in November 2023.

OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT tech, which rivals Google&apos;s own AI efforts such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, currently powers features such asÂ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-bing-milestone-100-million-dau">Bing Chat</a>, and it looks like Microsoft is planning to shift gears and further its own AI tech in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Pixel 8a bearing G8HHN, GKV4X, G6GPR, and G576D models spotted at FCC.</li><li>The listing confirms the device launch is sooner, presumably at Google I/O 2024.</li><li>One of the model numbers matches with the Pixel 8a earlier retail packaging.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With the Google I/O event right around the corner, we expect the Pixel 8a to be seen next to the launch of the Pixel Fold 2. While the latter&apos;s details are still scarce, the former just showed up at the U.S. FCC listing.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/18/google-pixel-8a-fcc/">9to5Google</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> bearing multiple model numbers has reached FCC approval on Monday (Mar. 18). They include <strong>G8HHN</strong>, <strong>GKV4X</strong>, <strong>G6GPR</strong>, and <strong>G576D</strong> â all of which are believed to be different variants of the same device.Â </p><p>As 9to5 indicates, this is a fairly common practice for every smartphone before launching since they are catered to different countries and carriers. Hence, the difference in model numbers is evident, which can be further different due to their connectivity options, such as 5G.</p>

<p>Previous leaks have showcased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-renders">Pixel 8a renders</a> revealing its design alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-retail-box-leaks">retail box leak</a>, which has further revealed the model number <strong>G6GPR</strong>. It evidently coincides with the latest FCC listing, confirming the device is indeed the Pixel 8a.Â </p><p>Aside from the FCC listing, the alleged Pixel 8a was also seen hitting a Denmark-based battery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-a-bigger-battery">certification</a> last month. The device featured a <strong>GH2MB</strong> model number featuring a 4942mAh battery capacity, which could be touted as either 5000mAh or 5500mAh battery when the device launches.Â </p><p>While the model doesn&apos;t appear familiar to the aforementioned model numbers, previous leaks have indicated that it matches one of the Pixel 7a models, its predecessor in some regions.</p>

<p>Apart from the certifications, the previous renders have given us the Pixel 8a in all its glory. It features a familiar design with a dual camera setup at the back and is believed to be coming in some kind of rose gold colorway next to the traditional black variant. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> was also seen in colors like blue and orange, we can expect something similar to its predecessor.Â </p><p>Earlier reports have further indicated that the Pixel 8a should feature a 6.1-inch screen on the front with a punch-hole cutout. Underneath, we could also spot a Tensor G3 that powered the Pixel 8 series.Â </p><p>Other rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-higher-price">have indicated</a> that the device could be priced higher than before. It is not just that a Google software engineer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-coming-with-android-battery-stats">recently confirmed</a> its existence while responding to a user bug report. All in, we could see the Pixel 8a at Google I/O 2024, which is slated for May 14.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is probably the most powerful Android phone that you're likely to find in 2024, with unrivalled software and camera performance, a sophisticated anti-glare flat display with built-in stylus, and enough software support to keep device relevant into the 2030's. The biggest issue we have with the S24 Ultra is its steep price tag, so this $150 price drop is music to our ears.Â <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMR53NSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="19c02c88-3e79-4254-bedc-34d7371fea2b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,299.99" data-dimension48="$1,299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>For a few more bucks, you can get the Nothing Phone 2, which adds features like wireless charging support, more light strips on the back, and an improved processor.

<p>When it comes to finding the right phone, you might be interested in looking beyond the usual brands. Thatâs where a brand like Nothing comes in, and the Nothing Phone 2 vs. Nothing Phone 2a is an interesting comparison. The phones look similar and boast similar feature sets. The Nothing Phone 2a is the newer, slightly step-down, more affordable option. But will it meet your needs, and can you even get it? Letâs take a look.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-2-the-looks-and-basics-2">Nothing Phone 2a vs. Phone 2: The looks and basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL" name="nothing-phone-2a-home-screen-red-01.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a with the stock glass red wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 2a has the same Glyph interface with which Nothing fans have become accustomed, with a transparent back that lets you see the inner workings inside. It comes in black, white, or Milk colorways and has a total of three light strips on the back that illuminate to show different actions, from incoming notifications to an expired timer, volume adjustments, and music playback. This is complemented by 26 addressable Glyph interface zones that truly make the phone stand out among others youâve seen beyond the ones from this brand.Â </p><p>The screen is an ample-sized 6.7-inch AMOLED with a decent 2,412 x 1,080-pixel resolution and 1,300 nits peak brightness. You get up to 120Hz refresh rate and down to about 30Hz. Encased in a polycarbonate chassis with aluminum side rails coated in a polycarbonate resin, this budget phone is not ultra-rugged by any means. But it does have a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 screen, and youâll probably protect the phone in a case anyway.Â </p><p>In addition to enjoying the lights on the exterior of the device, you can also customize the phoneâs screen using themes like monochromatic. Choose from many nothing OS widgets to further personalize the experience so the phone provides all the information you need to get through your day. Android Centralâs Nicholas Sutrich says in his review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> that the companyâs home screen design has a calming quality to it.Â </p><p>Speaking of which, the Nothing Phone 2a has a 5,000mAh battery that will give you a day or two of use per charge, and it supports 45W fast charging that can get you another day in just 20 minutes. Thereâs no support for wireless or reverse charging, though.Â </p><p>The IP54-rated phone can withstand small sprays of water, but it can be submerged. It comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage along with USB-C, dual 5G, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, NFC, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and stereo speakers. However, one thing to keep in mind is that as of this writing, the Nothing Phone 2a is only available in the U.K. and India, though those in the U.S. can get their hands on one as part of the developer program. Thereâs no official word on widespread U.S. availability just yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CqoaiemQLuCy6AzPJ2chVL" name="nothing-phone-2-with-glyph-lights-on.jpg" alt="The Nothing Phone 2's colorways with glyph lights on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CqoaiemQLuCy6AzPJ2chVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does that compare to the Nothing Phone 2? The mid-level step-up, although a year older, is indeed available in the U.S. right now. So, right off the bat, itâs easier to get your hands on. It employs the same Glyph interface, available in dark grey or white. It has more addressable Glyph interface zones at 33 and almost four times the number of light strips at 11. So, this phone shines more brightly on the back and can provide more notifications, or at least more detail with notifications, than the subtler strategy with the Glyph interface on the Nothing Phone 2a.Â </p><p>It has the same 6.7-inch, 2,412 x 1,080 AMOLED screen but higher peak brightness at 1,600 nits, so you can expect this phoneâs screen to be a bit brighter and bolder, perhaps easier to read in direct sunlight. It, too, goes up to 120Hz refresh rate but can also go down to 1Hz, which could make a difference in terms of battery life and efficiency depending on what tasks youâre doing.Â </p><p>Made of aluminum, it has a premium and lightweight feel to it. Sutrich says the curved back adds to the elegant feel as well. The phone is by and large identical in size to its newer sister device (though oddly slightly heavier as well). It has the same Corning Gorilla Glass 5 screen as well, and works with the same Nothing OS, widgets, and more for a customized experience on screen.Â </p><p>Interestingly, the Nothing Phone 2 has a smaller 4,700mAh battery, though itâs still rated to last a day or more. It also supports 15W wireless charging as well as wired along with 5W reverse charging, with the promise that youâll get a full wired charge in under an hour. Nonetheless, if you use wireless chargers, youâll want to stick with this phone.Â </p><p>The Nothing Phone 2 has the same IP54 rating, so neither of these phones will go swimming with you, nor will they even be used by the pool without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-nothing-phone-2-cases">a protective case</a>. (Note that because of the camera placement on the back and marginal difference in size, you wonât be able to use a Nothing Phone 2 case on the Nothing Phone 2a and vice versa). With the Nothing Phone 2, you get the addition of 512GB storage along with 128GB and 256GB, a potential deciding factor since neither phone offers expandable storage.Â </p><p>Other features are the same, including USB-C, dual 5G, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, NFC, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and stereo speakers.</p>

<p>Letâs see how these two phones compare head-to-head when examining specs alone.</p>

<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-2-power-processing-and-more-2">Nothing Phone 2a vs. Phone 2: Power, processing, and more</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UZGUkwBKCrEUt5HT7eqxAM" name="nothing-phone-2a-back-03.jpg" alt="The back of the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZGUkwBKCrEUt5HT7eqxAM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both these phones, as noted, look stunning and unique on the outside. But what is going on behind-the-scenes in the inner workings of the devices?Â </p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a has a slower processor, which is one of the key features that makes it the step-down budget option. It runs on the Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro octa-core processor, which is more than sufficient for everyday activities. In fact, it is more than just sufficient: in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">first impressions review</a>, Sutrich played several mobile games on the device, and they ran without a hitch. This might be in part thanks to the advanced cooling system, large vapor chamber, and large cooling area that helps dissipate heat.Â </p><p>If you opt for the 128GB version, youâll get 8GB RAM, but itâs advisable to go with the 256GB variant, which offers 12GB RAM. A RAM booster feature can use any free storage you have as more memory, so the phone runs more efficiently as well.Â </p><p>The phone comes out of the box with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and supports three years of major Android updates and four years of security updates. Thatâs not quite as long as with some of the bigger brands, but itâs still a decent amount of time to ensure you get the most out of the investment.</p>

As the older model, it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> out of the box but supports up to three years of major Android updates (which means you have two left after Android 14) and four years of security updates, which are delivered frequently to the device.Â </p><p>It runs on the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</a> processor, which is still a step down from the most current premium devices, but this is a middle-market phone. Sutrich says he never felt as though the phoneâs performance was lacking in any way despite the older processor. He played various games and didnât experience lag or slowdowns, even with graphics-heavy titles.Â </p><p>As noted, the Nothing Phone 2 comes with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB capacities, and the smallest storage option is supported by 8GB RAM, while the two larger ones come with 12GB.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4T9zkW2cPKeM34fPv2VaqM" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-01.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone 2a with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4T9zkW2cPKeM34fPv2VaqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Nothing Phone 2a and Nothing Phone 2 have identical camera systems. This includes a 50MP dual main camera, including an ultra-wide lens and a 32MP front wide camera. Youâll get all the usual features youâd expect for taking photos, like night photography, portraits, zoom, panorama, and more.Â </p><p>The biggest difference lies in the placement of the cameras: the Nothing Phone 2a has the rear camera in the center of the back, while on the Nothing Phone 2, the cameras are arranged vertically down the left side. Â Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bPocTb82x7F93NgB3LQjS6" name="Nothing-phone-2-camera-lenses.jpg" alt="The back of the Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPocTb82x7F93NgB3LQjS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Donât expect to get amazing photos from this phone, at least not when compared to more premium devices. But if you just want to be able to take decent shots, they are both pretty much the same in this respect. Itâs worth noting that for anyone familiar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review#:~:text=Android%20Central%20Verdict,battery%20lasts%20over%20a%20day">Nothing Phone 1</a>, Sutrich says the cameras have been âsubstantially improvedâ compared to that previous generation model.Â </p><p>While he didnât test the cameras in the Nothing Phone 2a at length, Sutrich found that with the Nothing Phone 2, he got crisp and clean shots with decent dynamic range, natural colors, and portrait mode cutouts and bokeh that are âout-of-this-worldâ good. Assuming the Nothing Phone 2a cameras perform similarly, youâll be happy with either phone in this respect if youâre stepping up from the Nothing Phone 1.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QZt4RmDayLFAy6H6VKqdTM" name="Nothing-phone-2-back-glyphs-on-08.jpg" alt="The Glyph lights illuminated on the back of a Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZt4RmDayLFAy6H6VKqdTM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the decision between the Nothing Phone 2a vs. Nothing Phone 2. Both phones come in at affordable prices, even with the 512GB/12GB RAM version of the Nothing Phone 2. It comes down to the small details.Â </p><p>If you want the most built-in storage possible, youâll want to go with the Nothing Phone 2 since it offers a 512GB option. For those who use wireless charging often, the Nothing Phone 2 is the only phone of the two that supports it. If you have other compatible devices, youâll love being able to make use of reverse charging, too.Â </p><p>Since the Nothing Phone 2a is newer, however, it will last a bit longer in terms of software and security updates. But realistically, most people nowadays upgrade their phones within 2-3 years anyway. With that said, if you want a phone you can hang onto for as long as possible, the Nothing Phone 2a is the safer option.Â </p><p>If you use the phone a lot outdoors, you might appreciate the higher peak brightness of the Nothing Phone 2, and if you do a lot of intense tasks, the better processor and more adaptable refresh rate will make a difference, too.Â </p><p>The biggest consideration to make is availability. If youâre in India or the U.K., the Nothing Phone 2a is a more affordable option if youâre really pinching pennies and can live with the trade-offs. If youâre in the U.S. or Canada, you might not even be able to easily get your hands on the Nothing Phone 2a, at least for now. So, stick with the Nothing Phone 2. In both cases, youâre getting a wonderful device for a killer price.</p>

<p>You wonât find a more affordable phone packed with as many features and with such a unique look as the Nothing Phone 2a. The only hindrance right now is availability since itâs only available in select countries outside of the developer program. But itâs a solid entry-level budget phone that doesnât make too many concessions when compared to the Nothing Phone 2.</p></p>

<p>With wider availability and step-up features, the Nothing Phone 2 is not a massive jump in price compared to the more affordable Nothing Phone 2a. It is an older model, but itâs barely a year old, so it still has tons of life left. With a brighter screen, better processor, support for wireless charging, and a more prominent Glyph interface, itâs worth the few extra bucks.</p></p>

<ul><li>Chrome for Android now supports non-Google password managers.Â </li><li>Previously, users were forced to use Googleâs password manager and Chromeâs autofill options.</li><li>The new setting isnât totally reliable, and is currently hidden.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Password managers are all but essential given the vast number of usernames and passwords we have to remember. But up until now, Chrome users have been restricted to using Googleâs password manager to save all these details. For many, this limitation could be enough justification to use one of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">best Android browser</a> options. Now, though, a hidden setting may be about to make Chrome a little more appealing.</p><p>Work on integrating third-party password managers with Chrome was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-password-manager-integration-flag-spotted">first spotted</a> in November 2023. Now, X user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1769738419792490577">Leopeva64</a>, the same person who spied that development, has noticed that the setting appears to have gone live on Chrome.Â </p><p>This means that users are no longer restricted to using Googleâs password manager. But as noted in a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/chrome-android-change-default-password-provider/"><u>Android Police</u></a>, the feature is currently hidden, and in order to use it, you need to enable a specific Chrome flag â chrome://flags/#enable-autofill-virtual-view-structure â before the setting will become visible.Â </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4 months ago I showed a new section in Chrome for Android that lets you use other providers to autofill passwords, this feature now works and if you choose the "Use other providers" option, Chrome no longer shows you suggestions from its password manager:https://t.co/Uvgqr181vs pic.twitter.com/leDXe2Lhnx<a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1769738419792490577">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Once the feature has been activated, users can go to the Chrome settings menu, and under Autofill Options is the option to âUse other providersâ. Selecting this option will automatically default to whatever password manager you have active in your Android settings.</p><p>Importantly though, there seems to be a good reason why this setting is currently hidden. According to Android Police, while using a non-Google password manager did work for populating passwords, there were issues with trying to save new passwords when entering them for the first time (although you can save them manually).Â </p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-for-android-alternative-password-manager-3426820/">Other reports</a> also suggest third-party password managers donât always populate your saved usernames, which indicates the experience is far from polished. This would explain why you have so much trouble activating it at the moment.</p><p>There is no indication of when this feature might be made more publicly available. In the longer term, though, this could make life easier for anyone who prefers an alternative password manager to Googleâs default.Â </p>

<p>Google Meet for the web has gained a nifty new feature that initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-touch-ups-on-mobile">ventured</a> into mobile devices last year. It is dubbed portrait touch-up and promises to enhance users&apos; appearance during or before conference calls.</p><p>In the announcement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/03/google-meet-portrait-touch-up-web.html">Google Workspace post</a>, the search giant says that the new portrait touch-up can be utilized to lightly touch up the user&apos;s appearance before attending (here&apos;s a quick how-to-use Meet&apos;s virtual green room to check yourself before a call) or during the meeting. The feature seeks to make users feel "comfortable and confident" in their appearance while taking up video conferencing calls.</p><p>The portrait touch-up provides two modes of play: subtle and smooth. The former offers light complexion smoothing, under-eye lightning, and eye whitening. On the other hand, Smoothing offers slightly more complexion smoothing next to under-eye lightning and eye whitening.</p>

<p>In the blog post, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVC1R58D04x9PpTKf0ssFVTlAzTIbd3z8WxmNjk4H_9XECFQgVH9s0CIGJg9WT1KQvLwfHdXAz7igZYXZ1bwv1nX7KMx5RYdDd_HiHkU6gB0pIy3Ei0gXgiFo0rC7go9UiHt1ymS6jQxjUlWdEgsmAj0XGoi5v0uQ79dgRzT1EdbV8NNBnUIfQmJSRVh4/s1326/Untitled%20(1).gif">shared a small GIF</a> showcasing how to use the feature during a meeting. The feature can be found in the Appearance section at the top right, next to Backgrounds and Filters. There is a new toggle, which, when enabled, gives users to choose either Subtle or Smoothing mode. Users have to bear in mind that the feature will be turned off by default and should be enabled by the user.Â </p><p>It is encouraging to see Google expanding the touch up feature from mobile devices to the web and catching up to other popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-teleconferencing-apps-android">video-conferencing apps</a> that already have such or similar features.</p>
<p>The first rollout of the portrait touch up mode for Google Meet for the web has already begun for those on the Rapid Release domains over the weekend. As Google notes in the announcement post, the extended rollout will be after April 1, 2024.</p><p>The feature for Google Meet users will be available to Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Starter, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, Teaching & Learning Upgrade, Google One, and Google Workspace Individual subscribers.</p>
