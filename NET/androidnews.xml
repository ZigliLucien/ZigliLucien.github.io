Samsung debuted the new generation of the Z Flip earlier this month, and this leftover preorder deal is for the 512GB configuration. It also sports strong battery life, beautiful interior and cover screens, and a new design that more closely resembles the S24 line. Plus, Samsung has added dust resistance with this generation, along with an upgraded 50MP sensor for the main camera.</p>

<p>Samsung unveiled the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> earlier this month, offering a few key improvements from the last generation of its flip phones. Despite being new, Best Buy is already offering a trade-in deal for up to $460 off the Z Flip 6, and buyers will also get a $250 gift card. This capable smartphone features an upgraded camera sensor, 512GB of storage, and a more refined design than the Z Flip 5. It also boasts a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor for quick, smooth performance.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-B6-Mint-256/5971687711" target="_blank">Walmart - $1,100.00</a>| <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Camcorder-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D19B2D19" target="_blank">Amazon - $1,099.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6-512gb-unlocked-silver-shadow/6586738.p?skuId=6586738" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c3c0a853-f3cc-452d-b96b-d6fee858a6a6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219.99" data-dimension48="$1,219.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you have a good phone to trade in and you&apos;re looking for an excellent deal on a new phone; you&apos;re a regular Best Buy shopper; you&apos;ve liked other Samsung products, or past Z Flip generations; you want a phone with industry-leading battery life and performance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather go for a cheaper phone and you don&apos;t mind looking at past generations; you&apos;re not looking for a flip phone; you need something with a headphone jack.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is just the latest generation of Samsung&apos;s history building contemporary flip phones, and it&apos;s clear that they&apos;ve got the formula pretty dialed by this point. The Z Flip 6 offers an updated 50MP camera sensor, an improved design that looks more like the S24 line, and the addition of dust resistance. Besides that, it packs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, and Samsung has recently been discounting the mid-level 512GB storage option to be the same price as the entry-level 256GB. You can also expect pretty solid battery life, and a handful of fun AI features.</p>

<p><em>Of course, Best Buy isn&apos;t the only retailer offering discounts on Samsung&apos;s newest devices.

I&apos;ve used their products — both consumer products like phones and industrial products like remote terminal units — and thought they were best in class. As far as phones go, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-x-developer-editons-appear-verizon-version-now-available">first Moto X</a> is still one of the best and most innovative devices ever made in my opinion.</p><p>Then Google lost interest in the company, and it ended up being bought by Lenovo, one of my least favorite manufacturers. Mediocre products with terrible support meant I was happy to tell anyone that you should never buy a product with a Motorola logo on it.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web&apos;s longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>I wasn&apos;t happy about this. Motorola had fallen from the company that made both the best "flagship" phone in the Moto X and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g-versus-moto-x">best budget phone in the Moto G</a> to a company I couldn&apos;t recommend with a clear conscious. Rehashing the same thing year after year and having a pricing strategy that made no sense made their products forgettable, and failing to support them once they were sold made them regrettable. </p><p>Motorola may not be the "American-made" company they once were, but the way the company is turning itself around shouldn&apos;t be dismissed. I think one of their phones in particular — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-price-configuration-leak">The 2024 Razr</a> — is once again the best in class.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3727px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="skSbUta6M7qghmVryLNtSQ" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-06.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vegan leather back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/skSbUta6M7qghmVryLNtSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3727" height="2096" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">a foldable</a> and really don&apos;t see myself using them in the immediate future. I don&apos;t think they are a fad though, and I honestly believe they will become mainstream in the coming years. Companies aren&apos;t going to stop making "regular" phones, but foldables will gain significant market share eventually.</p><p>I have a few reasons for resisting. I really do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-has-me-almost-ready-for-foldable">love the flip form factor</a> and phones like the Galaxy Z Flip and the Razr are functional and fun to use. I&apos;m not in love with the plastic screens, I think they have inherent durability issues, but most of all I hate the price. I&apos;m never going to buy a Z Flip or a Razr when I can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-google-can-sell-pixel-8a-for-just-499">Pixel 8a for hundreds less</a> and have every feature except flipping it open.</p>
<p>I know folding phones are more expensive because making them costs a lot more. But Motorola has the right idea here by releasing both the Razr Plus and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-vs-razr-plus-2023">more price-friendly Razr</a>. Samsung could do the same (and maybe it will) by announcing a Z Flip FE but Motorola is doing it now.</p><p>This ties in with the company&apos;s marketing and advertising push which feels a lot like something we would see from Samsung or Apple. It&apos;s well done, and not a bunch of numbers for nerds to fight about. It shows how fun these phones are and people want something fun. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">As Android Central&apos;s EiC Shruti Shekar points out</a>, Samsung needs to worry about this because Motorola is doing it better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL" name="Paris-Hilton-before-after-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024.jpg" alt="A young Paris Hilton with the original Hot Pink Razr V3 and again with the new Hot Pink Razr Plus 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram / Paris Hilton)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">still makes budget phones</a> and the lineup is still too confusing. I think that the company can meld the Razr marketing into something that works as well for $200 phones, letting you know why you might want one. Websites like AC can still analyze the devices, pointing out both the flaws and features if you need more information before you buy but Moto is making sure you know they exist.</p>
<p>The one concern I still have is product support. I don&apos;t mean some silly promise about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">seven OS upgrades</a> (your phone is not going to last that long nor will it be able to include all the goodies seven years from now); I mean supporting the products they sell for a reasonable lifespan. I would love to see a reasonable security patch schedule as well as prompt attention to the inevitable bugs that will pop up.</p><p>This is one area where Motorola slid from the top of the hill to the sewer and that leaves plenty of room for improvement. Motorola has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">pledged that it will improve</a>, giving a schedule it can live up to for planned updates and it should have a team in place that can handle any pressing bugs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1422px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="J6zwh2EoTM6YpydtV672Pd" name="moto-g-stylus-2024-red-in-hand.jpg" alt="Moto G Stylus (2024) in Scarlet Wave" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6zwh2EoTM6YpydtV672Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1422" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m willing to believe the company. It has shown me that it does take great pride in its products and it is spending time and money to market them. Supporting them well would be the logical choice.</p><p>Times are tough right now. They are slowly getting better and that means more people will have the means to do things like buy a new phone. It really looks like Motorola realizes this and is willing to spend money to try and make money. I think what they are doing is great and I&apos;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>My endorsement or my purchase doesn&apos;t mean much for Motorola&apos;s bottom line. But I am a firm believer that we all should "vote with our wallets" and strive to buy products and support companies we think are doing the right thing. Motorola has the right ideas when it comes to selling foldables and offers a great line of affordable products. It&apos;s working to sort out its marketing and appeal to regular folks like us and that&apos;s something we all should get behind.</p>

<p>After setting up basic apps on your Flip 6&apos;s cover screen, you can add widgets to get even more use out of it. This option isn&apos;t natively available, but thankfully Samsung offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">wonderful Android app</a> to unlock the feature on your Z Flip 6.</p>
<p>1. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock"><strong>Download and install the Good Lock app</strong></a> on your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>2.

<p>While Samsung limits your cover screen usage to select apps, you can still customize it and get a lot done on your Z Flip 6. It&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Plus 2024 competitor</a>, but it&apos;s no amateur either.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve put in the work and added widgets via Good Lock, your Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s outer display is transformed into a secondary phone of sorts. You can add basic apps to it like your calendar, to-do lists, music players, or weather widgets. But then you can also turn things up by adding social media and messaging apps, video players, and even internet browsers.</p><p>Not all apps have been optimized for the Z Flip 6&apos;s tiny 3.4-inch external display, so don&apos;t expect a perfect result each time. Play around with the widgets and apps to find out what works best for you.</p>

<p>This update might be iterative, but we highly recommend getting the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 if you're new to foldable or have a generous budget. The new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset is pretty powerful, plus you get a slightly larger battery, better cameras, and for the first time ever, both water and dust resistance.</p></p>

<h2 id="more-of-the-same-isn-apos-t-always-bad-but-this-time-it-is-2">More of the same isn&apos;t always bad, but this time it is</h2>
<p>Samsung has not changed the battery capacity and charging speed of the Galaxy Z Fold since the Galaxy Z Fold 4. I am certain I speak for everyone when I say that it is getting pretty tiring. The Korean tech giant has done a marvelous job of refining its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> and making them mainstream, but the stale specifications have made an excellent device quite uninteresting this time around.</p><p>You get the same old 4,400mAh lithium-ion battery made up of dual 2,200mAh batteries. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> recharges at 25W wired charging and 10-15W wireless charging speeds. You can also top up other devices with your Fold 6 at 4.5W reverse wireless charging speeds. There&apos;s nothing new or revolutionary here, which I find extremely disappointing. I&apos;ve been waiting for Samsung to update its archaic charging speeds for two generations now, to no avail. Maybe the Fold 7 will bring more drastic upgrades to Samsung&apos;s larger foldables.</p><p>To get the compatible wireless charging speeds, however, you need to make sure that you&apos;re using a compatible charging pad or stand. Samsung&apos;s wireless charging profile is called Samsung Fast Charge Wireless 2.0 and it&apos;s not available with every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">Qi wireless charger</a>, so be very thorough when buying one for your Fold 6. In addition to that, your compatible 15W wireless charger needs to be plugged into a Quick Charge 2.0 PD adapter that&apos;s rated for at least 25W wired charging speeds. If you&apos;re confused or lazy to do the research, your best bet is to skip the confusion and buy a wireless charger and adapter directly from Samsung.</p><p>Things get worse when you factor in the $100 raise in the Fold 6&apos;s price. Considering the foldable phone comes with almost exactly the same dimensions, design, cameras, battery, and charging specs, the increased price tag is not justified. Sure, the Z Fold 6 has an IP48 water and dust-proof rating now, but it&apos;s not worth an extra Benjamin.</p>

<p>All the best Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 screen protectors are made of hardy 9H tempered glass, priced under $15, and come with at least two pieces in the box. Isn&apos;t that awesome? You don&apos;t have to worry about the quality or value for money. Just read through this list and pick a set that fits your needs the best.</p><p>Spigen&apos;s GlasTR EZ FIT Screen Protector for the Galaxy Watch 7 is the highest-quality screen protector for your wearable. It comes with the most straightforward, no-nonsense alignment tool I have ever seen which is super easy to use. That alone makes it worth the buy. If you don&apos;t want to spend even $15 on your smartwatch&apos;s screen guard, there are plenty of multipacks available for under $10.</p><p>For maximum value for money, I suggest getting one of the five plus five packs that come with five tempered glass screen protectors as well as five bumper cases. If you don&apos;t need splashy colors, the set from Tensea will do nicely. But if you want to match your Samsung Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s case with its paint job, KIMILAR has a wider assortment of colors such as green and pink.</p><p>When you&apos;re done picking out the right screen protector for your Watch 7, be sure to grab one or two extra watch straps as well.

<p>During a workout, the Galaxy Watch Ultra Quick Button has default functions that you can&apos;t change. Tapping it <strong>once</strong> will pause or restart a workout. <strong>Double-tapping</strong> the Quick button while running or cycling will start a new lap, while it will start a new session during weight-lifting activities. And <strong>holding</strong> the Quick button will end a workout, or transition to the next workout during a multi-workout activity (like a triathlon).</p><p>Aside from the fact that we wish Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">made the Quick Button a proper crown</a> so you could scroll through menus, we also wish it had given it more customization options. Ideally, you could give it two shortcuts, one for a single press and one for a double tap. And you should be able to make one of those shortcuts open your favorite app.</p><p>Still, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung&apos;s first time implementing a third, shortcut-dedicated button across years of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> and Tizen watches. We can hope that future software updates will add new functionality to the Quick Button, so it&apos;s not quite as limited. Even as is, it&apos;s a nice perk for those willing to upgrade over the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has a revamped Exynos CPU, double the storage, triple the health sensor LEDs, and dual-band GPS, making it faster and more accurate than almost all the fitness smartwatches out there. It's certainly on the expensive side compared to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> but has perks like multi-day battery life and an ultra-bright display to recommend it.</p></p>

This week&apos;s Meta Quest news was chock full of announcements, releases, rumors, leaks, and all sorts of other stuff that you don&apos;t want to miss — even if you technically <em>already</em> missed it. Don&apos;t worry, though, because I&apos;m rounding up all the important stuff you need to know from July 22-26, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="meta-ai-is-coming-to-quest-3-2">Meta AI is coming to Quest 3</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ub0KESi8VEY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This week, actor and influencer Anthony Hamilton Jr <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xR5CVJH1I/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">got the chance to try out</a> Meta&apos;s AI upgrade for the Quest early, showcasing a bunch of new features that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses owners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">have been using</a> for a few months now.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ai-coming-to-quest-headsets/">UploadVR</a> notes that this new feature will officially be called "Meta AI with Vision" and Quest 3 users should expect to see this feature pop-up in the Experimental section of the settings menu in August. That should coincide with the v68 firmware update, which is also expected in August.</p><p>The new update is replacing the existing voice commands on Quest with significantly enhanced ones that are allowed to use the headset&apos;s cameras — you&apos;ll have to give it permission first, of course — to view the world around you and answer questions. Hamilton Jr used them similarly to how many people have been using the feature on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, but we figure people will find other new ways of using it with a VR headset in the future.</p><p>This is the first time we&apos;ve seen an app allowed to use the front-facing cameras to identify the world around you. Previously, all Quest apps were only allowed access to a system-created playspace for the environment, which helps secure privacy but also severely limits mixed reality apps.</p><p>Developers have been calling for Meta to improve this feature and allow access to the camera so better mixed reality apps can be made. While Meta isn&apos;t saying this feature will be opened up to third parties in the future, this is a huge milestone for a potential future where that happens.</p>
<h2 id="our-first-look-at-the-meta-quest-3s-in-person-2">Our first look at the Meta Quest 3s in person</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.93%;"><img id="q9ZsCFmBU3CHam6EvUy6gH" name="meta-quest-3s-vr-panda-leak.jpg" alt="A Meta Quest 3s leak from user VR Panda on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9ZsCFmBU3CHam6EvUy6gH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: VR Panda on X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3s</a> has been rumored and leaked for months, but this week we got the first look at the potential new budget Quest headset in person from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZGFTECH/status/1816416846796689903">VR Panda on X</a>. VR Panda is a Meta Quest 3 accessory manufacturer that&apos;s been known to leak announcements before, including the Quest 3 as well as headsets from other companies like Pico.</p><p>This track record gives us confidence that the leak is real and it lines up nicely with previous promotional material leaks for the headset, which we expect to be announced at Meta Connect on September 25.</p><p>The front of the Quest 3s sports six cameras divided into two clusters that closely resemble that of an iPhone Pro model (pick a year, they&apos;re all the same). It&apos;s thought that this new headset will sport the same powerful Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as the more expensive Quest 3, as well as color mixed reality vision, but debut at a $299 price point.</p>
<h2 id="avatars-may-get-a-big-graphics-upgrade-2">Avatars may get a big graphics upgrade</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1616px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.40%;"><img id="8VPjRn8Xnm8ZwxgYbqF9Ci" name="meta-quest-avatars-update-2024.jpg" alt="New avatars in testing on a Meta Quest 3, as spotted by @Luna on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VPjRn8Xnm8ZwxgYbqF9Ci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1616" height="1073" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Luna on X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the years, Meta&apos;s avatar system has received significant overhauls and updates as the company has tried out different art styles and ideas. When Meta made its big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">Metaverse</a> push back in 2021, it made the first moves to get rid of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-finally-getting-rid-its-hideously-ugly-avatars">previously hideously ugly avatars</a>, following that up with giving them legs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-avatars-have-legs">two years later</a>.</p><p>Now, it looks like a handful of Meta employees are testing out a previously unseen avatar design, as shown in the image above and first seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1816175417922908480">by user Luna on X</a>. The new avatars do away with the more cartoony body size ratios that the current system employes — called "Boss Baby heads" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/RJdoesVR/status/1816182629605204229">by some users</a> — and seem to use more realistic graphics, as well.</p><p>Meta hasn&apos;t officially announced a potential overhaul of its avatars yet but, if these turn out to be selected as the new design, we could see them get announced as early as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected">September 25 at Meta Connect</a>.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-objects-look-better-in-the-real-world-2">Virtual objects look better in the real world</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EgrT9MNa7m4bfq7uRFyWN9" name="building-for-mixed-reality-on-quest-3.jpg" alt="Meta's "building for mixed reality on Quest 3" promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgrT9MNa7m4bfq7uRFyWN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This week, Meta updated its development tools to support better mixed reality quality, targeting how virtual objects look in the real world. The new update specifically addressed <em>how</em> virtual objects look when a physical object blocks your view of the virtual object.</p><p>In an example at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-3-mixed-reality-occlusion-v67-sdk-upgrade/">UploadVR</a>, a real computer chair is placed in front of a virtual guitar and the Quest mostly succeeds at making it look like the virtual object is in the real world space. The new update improves the object cutout around physical objects so that these virtual objects look like they&apos;re interacting with the real object.</p><p>Furthermore, Meta&apos;s new update uses 80% less GPU and 50% less CPU processing, meaning developers will be able to make more meaningful mixed reality experiences and games. That could potentially make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5503065683135424/">Spatial Ops</a> look and feel even more genuine.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-shared-experiences-2">Upgrading shared experiences</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tsJMAM4Z5Yyvw2CRMV7kek" name="vr-multiplayer-oculus-quest-2-hero.jpg" alt="Multiple me's wearing Quest 2 headsets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsJMAM4Z5Yyvw2CRMV7kek.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the coolest things about VR is the ability to virtually hang out with someone and make it feel like they&apos;re in the same room with you, even if they are thousands of miles away. User <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1816569990428131785">Luna on X</a> found a new code in an early release version of August&apos;s v68 Quest update that points to Meta further expanding this concept, creating a feature that appears to be similar to Apple&apos;s SharePlay on Vision Pro.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, SharePlay allows iOS and Vision Pro users to make a FaceTime call, then launch an app, movie, or something else and watch it "together" by syncing the playback. This was particularly handy in the COVID quarantine days on phones but needs a VR headset to be enjoyed to its fullest.</p><p>Right now, there&apos;s little information on how this could look or work but, most likely, you&apos;ll make a call using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/social-features-and-sharing/create-or-join-group/">Meta Quest group feature</a>, then launch the app or video of your choice. The group feature is already used to make multiplayer gaming easier, so it makes sense for Meta to expand this to add functionality to make social experiences more seamless.</p>
<h2 id="vr-at-the-emmys-2">VR at the Emmys</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6kmVDTPWM9UFFusy9A8j2f" name="the-pirate-queen-official-screenshot-shrine.jpg" alt="Official screenshots from The Pirate Queen running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6kmVDTPWM9UFFusy9A8j2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Singer Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pirate Queen launched in April this year and it helped highlight the importance of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-pirate-queen-vr-education">learning history through virtual experiences</a>. The game, developed by Singer Studios and narrated by Lucy Liu — yes, the famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005154/">Lucy Liu</a> — puts players in the boots of Cheng Shih, one of the most infamous pirates of all time.</p><p>That adventure has now been nominated for an Emmy, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mixed-news.com/en/the-pirate-queen-wallace-gromit-vr-emmy-2024/">Mixed News</a>. The "Outstanding Emerging Media Program" award also included nominations for the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6744365485575791/">Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway on Quest</a> in addition to three other nominees.</p><p>As VR becomes more prevalent in society, we&apos;re seeing more and more award programs include VR content in addition to VR gaming. There&apos;s a special kind of empathy that comes from experiencing something first person through the eyes of another person, and it&apos;s great to see The Pirate Queen, in particular, receive this nomination.</p>

<p>Last year, Google unveiled the Pixel Watch 2 at the Made by Google event on October 4 and shipped it out on October 12. This year, Google is holding a Made by Google event on August 13; it&apos;s already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">teased the Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Pixel 9 Pro Fold in promo videos</a>, but has yet to hint at a wearable announcement.</p><p>If Google does showcase the Pixel Watch 3 in August, we can expect it to ship by the end of August. Otherwise, Google might choose to wait until October, as it did the last two generations.</p><p>The first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> cost $349, as did the Pixel Watch 2. The current rumor is that the Pixel Watch 3 will ship in two sizes that cost €399 and €449, respectively. Even though the Euro is slightly stronger than the dollar, Google currently charges €399 for the Pixel Watch 2, so we assume that means the Pixel Watch 3 will remain at $349 here, with the alleged Pixel Watch 3 XL costing somewhere between $370 and $400.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nNspkxqziKF7nerxoHjztM" name="google-pixel-watch-3-render.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 3 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nNspkxqziKF7nerxoHjztM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rumors began in January that Google would sell<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-pixel-watch-3-could-come-in-two-sizes"> the Pixel Watch 3 in two sizes</a>: 45mm and 41mm. Like the 41mm Pixel Watch 2, the Pixel Watch 3 would have a 1.2-inch AMOLED display, while the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 XL would jump to 1.4 inches.</p><p>Since then, we&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">Pixel Watch 3 renders via OnLeaks</a> that show a very similar design to the Pixel Watch 2, with the same edge-to-edge display, side crown, Google Assistant button, and bottom sensor array.</p><p>The key difference is that Google allegedly made the Watch 3 significantly thicker than the Watch 2, enlarging it from 12.3mm to 14mm. While the rumor is that Google put a thicker battery inside the Watch 3, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-battery-certification-spotted">leaked South Korean certification</a> showed the watch with a 307mAh capacity, just 1mAh more than the Pixel Watch 2. Instead, the extra thickness could come from new health sensors, though we don&apos;t know what.</p><p>The leak also suggests that the Pixel Watch 3 case measures 0.2mm shorter, so perhaps Google managed to shrink the Watch 2&apos;s thick display border to make it a little more petite.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PGZEEHRzjqDg3L33chyFHk" name="google-pixel-watch-3-xl-render.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PGZEEHRzjqDg3L33chyFHk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We later saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-xl-renders">Pixel Watch 3 XL renders via OnLeaks</a> that look, unsurprisingly, like a stretched-out Pixel 3. While the display allegedly measures 1.45 inches, everything else about the domed glass display and crown looks the same.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2&apos;s single size was one of our only hang-ups with its design, so we&apos;re looking forward to having an XL option.</p><p>We&apos;ll close out this section with a very unlikely, but still intriguing feature: Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-patent-shows-touch-bezel-controls">patented</a> "gesture recognition on watch bezel using strain gauges," meaning you could squeeze a smartwatch or touch and hold the outer edge of a display to trigger an action. It has the same principle as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>&apos;s touch bezel, except more specialized. In theory, Google could try to implement a version of this in the Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTjV2AijgSRpbXZRSUnoQ6" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-fitbit-workout-ui-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTjV2AijgSRpbXZRSUnoQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ve yet to hear any rumors about the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s CPU. Given the Pixel Watch 2 used the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 with a co-processor, the natural progression would be a Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 with CPU upgrades.</p><p>Google could choose to bring back the same chipset instead; smartwatches sometimes keep the same CPU across generations. On the other hand, Google and Qualcomm announced an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">RISC-V partnership last October</a> to create custom CPUs designed to specialize in Wear OS-related tasks. So it&apos;s possible we could see the fruits of this partnership in the Pixel Watch 3 with a custom chipset.</p><p>We&apos;ve yet to see any smartwatch offer more than 2GB of RAM, so that might remain unchanged. Google offered 32GB of storage last year, but could double it to 64GB with the Pixel Watch 3 to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="bY3ha2SoTVKjtzxfVek2nM" name="google-pixel-watch-3-render-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 3 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY3ha2SoTVKjtzxfVek2nM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We expect Google to bring back the same Fitbit-made health sensors: heart rate, blood oxygen, ECG, cEDA for stress, and skin temperature.</p><p>While the Pixel Watch 2 only had Bluetooth 5.0 and WiFi 2.4GHz connectivity, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-fcc-listing-detailed">Pixel Watch 3 rumor</a> suggests it&apos;ll add both WiFi 5GHz and UWB, with the latter used to auto-unlock your Pixel phone when your watch is nearby.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 should have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> out of the box. Google has already promised that this new version will make fitness tracking 20% more efficient, let you follow a specific goal during a workout like maintaining a specific heart rate zone, add new XML watch faces, and include new Complications like "Goal progress." It&apos;s all very fitness-focused, but we assume Google will have other non-fitness software perks up its sleeve.</p>

<p>While there&apos;s a lot to like about the Pixel Watch 2, but it&apos;s not as though this is the <em>perfect</em> smartwatch. Google made some questionable decisions this time around, along with a few more that we were ecstatic to see.</p><p>Nevertheless, we&apos;ve rounded up a few things that we&apos;d like for Google to implement with the next iteration of its smartwatch, to help it maintain its place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Another size</strong></p><p>If there’s one thing I’ve been asking for since Google unveiled the original Pixel Watch, it’s for there to be a larger size. When it comes to many of the best smartwatches, this isn’t really anything that you need to worry about, as there are usually at least two different options to choose from. However, this wasn’t the case with the Pixel Watch, and Google opted to stick with the same 41mm case sizing with the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>Even though it’s quite an elegant-looking wearable, it still looks quite comical for those who have larger wrists (like myself.) We’re not even saying that the Pixel Watch 3 needs to have an option as big as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>, but <em>something</em> larger than 41mm would be nice.</p><p>If Google creates the rumored Pixel Watch 3 XL, that&apos;ll solve one of my only problems with the last-gen watch.</p><p><strong>Smaller bezels</strong></p><p>Another annoyance, for some at least, is that the bezels on the Pixel Watch are simply too large. We were hoping to see some type of improvements made in this regard with the Pixel Watch 2, but alas, it wasn’t meant to be.</p><p>It’s not as much of a problem when using one of the built-in watch faces, which are quite elegant and useful in their own right. But as soon as you want to try using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-facer-on-pixel-watch">Facer</a> or build your own with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.watchface&hl=en_US">KWCH</a>, the bezels stick out like a sore thumb. Given the overall design, it’s not like we expect a bezel-less smartwatch, but just trim up the edges a bit.</p><p><strong>Pick a charging method and stick with it</strong></p><p>Last year, we got “wireless charging,” but it wasn’t the same experience compared to something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a>. You were stuck using Google’s own charger, and if something happened to it, you had to order another cable from Google. This time around, the Pixel Watch 2 uses the same charging method as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a>, courtesy of the pogo pins on the underside of the casing.</p><p>The result is faster charging speeds and a more reliable connection compared to the original Pixel Watch. But it also leaves us feeling a bit weary that Google could change things up again for the next iteration. While we would really love to see true wireless charging, complete with the ability to use reverse wireless charging, we’d also love for Google to pick a method and stick with it. If we’re destined to use Fitbit’s method of charging, so be it; just don’t keep going back and forth.</p><p><strong>Longer battery life</strong></p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 already improves upon battery life, as it’s rated for 24 hours even with the always-on display enabled. For comparison, the only way you could get that much juice out of its predecessor was if you were okay with turning the AOD off.</p><p>It’s definitely a big step in the right direction, but we’d love for Google to push the limits even further. There are a couple of ways that would allow for this, such as a new SoC that is more power efficient or simply using a bigger battery. But in order to squeeze a bigger battery in, it’s likely that this would require a redesigned case.</p><p>Or, ya know, just a larger size option.</p><p><strong>Just include Premium</strong></p><p>There’s something about the Pixel Watch and its successor that continues to pick at me. Prices start at $349, and while that includes six months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a>, there are another six months that you have to pay out of pocket. At least that’s the case if you want to keep using Premium features such as viewing your Stress Management and Sleep Score details.</p><p>Why not just include a full 12 months of Fitbit Premium with every new purchase? I understand the fact that Google is in the business of making money, but it’s not like you see Apple or Samsung hide these kinds of features behind a paywall. Something as basic as a Daily Readiness Score shouldn’t need to be something you need to pay for, so it’s kind of frustrating that this is the path that Google continues to go down.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Still chugging along</strong></em></p>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro was one of the rare smartwatches to last for days between charges. Since 2022, more smartwatches hit this benchmark and have added perks like dual-band GPS and brighter displays that make the Pro a bit outdated. Still, this is a reliable device with years of software support left, and is more comfortable than the Ultra (aside from the wonky band).</p></p>

<p>Why weigh the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro, watches released two years apart? Because the Ultra and Pro are Samsung&apos;s only two watches built with extra battery life, many Watch 5 Pro owners are weighing whether or not to upgrade to the expensive Ultra.</p><p>As the person who reviewed both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, I&apos;m ready to compare every perk the Ultra offers, but also the drawbacks that might make Pro owners decide to stick with their current watch for now. Samsung has told us that it has no current plans for new "Pro" watches, but that might change in the future, and the Galaxy Watch Ultra is an expensive option.</p><p>Below, I break down every key similarity and difference between the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, to help make your decision easier!</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-on-wrists.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (silver) versus the Galaxy Watch Ultra (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 5 Pro come in one size, instead of the dual options you get with mainline Galaxy Watches. Of the two, the Pro has a more comfortable design, though not without its drawbacks.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra weighs 14g more and measures about 1.5mm thicker than the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, which is already a fairly large and heavy watch. Both use lightweight and durable titanium, but the Pro has a rounded case that matches its display bezel, while the Ultra has a square-shaped case jutting outside of the circular display at each corner — giving it a squircle look.</p><p>All recent Galaxy Watches have an IP68 rating against dust and water damage and an MIL-STD-810H rating against shock damage. The Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s protections go further: Samsung promises it can withstand altitudes as high as Mount Everest, temperatures from -4°F to 131°F (-20ºC to 55ºC), and deeper depths (10ATM) than the Watch 5 Pro (5ATM).</p>

<p>Both watches have an elevated bezel that helps prevent scratches if you bonk your watch against a wall. The Ultra bezel has lines matching a clock&apos;s hourly graduations, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/what-color-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-should-you-buy">different colors based on the case color</a>. I prefer my Titanium Gray Ultra with orange lines, which match the orange Quick Button and my orange band. Compared to that, the Watch 5 Pro&apos;s appearance is a bit plainer.</p><p>Speaking of bands, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has three default options: the thick elastomer Marine, rubber Peakform, and thin nylon Trail. The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro defaulted to the D-Buckle Sport, a magnetized band that was comfortable for normal use but impossible to secure well during workouts. I disliked it and would have preferred <em>any</em> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-bands">Watch Ultra&apos;s bands</a>.</p><p>On the topic of buttons, both watches have a Home and Back button along the right edge, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra has a third Quick Button for another shortcut like starting or pausing an exercise, as well as triggering a loud siren with a long press. Neither has the physical rotating bezel of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, instead using a digital touch bezel along the display edge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NciCcxeqkyotjjbrFbShPj" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-displays.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (silver) versus the Galaxy Watch Ultra (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NciCcxeqkyotjjbrFbShPj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re looking for justification to upgrade your Watch 5 Pro, the outdated display is where I&apos;d start. A 1.4-inch AMOLED with 1,000 nits of brightness, the Watch 5 Pro display is perfectly readable indoors and has the same 320 ppi resolution as the Ultra. But it&apos;s on the dim side in direct sunlight, and you have a lot of wasted black border space along the edge.</p><p>By contrast, the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s 1.5-inch AMOLED hits a blazing 3,000 nits and looks fantastic every time I go running in sunny weather. There&apos;s virtually no wasted border space, which does have one tiny drawback: while using the digital bezel, your finger is more likely to block the bottom portion of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro-hardware-and-sensors-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro: Hardware and sensors</h2>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has 33% more RAM, double the storage, and an Exynos CPU clocked significantly higher. Samsung claims the Exynos W1000 can load apps 2.7x faster and perform multi-core tasks 3.7x faster than the Exynos W930 in the Galaxy Watch 6. The Watch 5 Pro&apos;s Exynos W920 isn&apos;t that far off from the W930 for clock speed, but less RAM does have a noticeable impact in daily use.</p><p>While 16GB of storage sounds like a lot for a smartwatch, Samsung uses about 11GB of that on default Wear OS software. So if you plan to stream music or podcasts on your watch while leaving your phone at home, the Watch Ultra has much more room for downloaded playlists — or built-in LTE to stream things instead. With the Watch 5 Pro, you may or may not have paid the extra $50 for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gPx6ALhoraSnvVS8vif22e" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-close-up.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (silver) versus the Galaxy Watch Ultra (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gPx6ALhoraSnvVS8vif22e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Watch Ultra and Watch 5 Pro continuously measure heart rate and stress, then track blood oxygen, skin temperature, breathing, sleep stages, and other stats at night. They also actively and passively check for AFib issues. The Watch Ultra has newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> health metrics like Energy Score, but we expect the Watch 5 Pro should receive that update later this summer.</p><p>One key difference is that Samsung redesigned the Galaxy Watch Ultra to have triple the number of LEDs along its bottom compared to older Galaxy Watches; this reportedly makes it more accurate for workout tracking, and that proved noticeably true during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a>.</p><p>Another important difference is that Samsung gave the Galaxy Watch Ultra dual-band GPS tracking, which significantly improved the accuracy of my workout results compared to the GPS-only Watch 5 Pro or Watch 6. If you run, hike, cycle, or do any outdoor workouts in areas where tree foliage, buildings, or mountains can interfere with satellite signals, you&apos;ll appreciate this upgrade.</p><p>Still, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is more <em>comfortable</em> while working out because of the weight, which may matter more if you chose the Pro as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro-battery-life-charging-and-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro: Battery life, charging, and software</h2>
<p>Samsung says the Galaxy Watch Ultra lasts 60 hours in normal conditions with AOD active, 16 hours during workouts with dual-band GPS, or 100 hours in power-saving mode. The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro had an original estimate of 80 hours without AOD or 20 hours with GPS.</p><p>In truth, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has lasted closer to two days with AOD and maybe 12 hours while tracking workouts. Because of its much-brighter screen, faster processor with more RAM, and extra sensor LEDs, it burns more battery for everyday tasks. It&apos;s not far off from the Pro if you disable AOD, but it&apos;s not quite at the battery level you might hope for at this price point!</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is two years old, and my colleague Andrew Myrick — who continued to use the Watch 5 Pro for years — has told me its battery life has been cut in half since then. Thankfully, it has the same 10W charging speed as the Ultra, so both refill in the same amount of time (about 2wo hours).</p><p>The other "longevity" point to consider is that the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro has just two years of software support left through summer 2026, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra gets Samsung&apos;s usual four years of Wear OS upgrades and security patches through mid-2028.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro-should-you-upgrade-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro: Should you upgrade?</h2>

<p>A new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is hard to find these days. When it&apos;s available, it&apos;s typically on sale, widening the $200 gap between it and the Ultra; but I&apos;d argue that it&apos;s not worth buying new unless you can find one for <em>really</em> cheap, due to all its last-gen downgrades.</p><p>That said, whether you should upgrade from the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro to Galaxy Watch Ultra depends on what you think of your Pro. Can you accept adding extra weight onto your wrist, or is the slimmer Pro a perk worth holding onto? Do you need better health data, more storage, and faster app loading, or can you hold out for another year to save yourself some money?</p><p>You can downgrade to the shorter-lived <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> for something lighter, but for comparable battery life in a newer device, you&apos;ll need the Galaxy Watch Ultra. It&apos;s very expensive, especially once Samsung&apos;s limited-time $350 credit for the Watch 5 Pro ends, so if you <em>are</em> considering an upgrade, now would be the time!</p><p>We&apos;ve included the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> since it launched, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra is ready to claim that spot.</p>

<p>Foldable phones used to be a far-flung concept from science fiction, but the latest in foldable smartphones brings the ideas of the future to the here and now. Built with strong aluminum frames and cutting-edge ultra-thin glass that can literally fold in half, these phones will amaze you every single time you open and close them.</p><p>Right now, it&apos;s nigh impossible to find a more ideal foldable phone than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. When unfolded, it looks similar to the average smartphone, including a sleek and slim chassis with an all-day battery. But, when you&apos;re all done and just need to fit it in your jeans pocket, you can fold it in half, and it magically seems to fit just about anywhere.</p><p>The beauty of the foldables market is that you don&apos;t just have to have a "normal" shape phone that folds in half. What if you&apos;d rather have a regular-size phone that <em>unfolds</em> into a tablet instead? Or maybe a book-style foldable makes more sense, giving you two screens instead of one. Either way you fold them, these tremendous foldable phones bring the best parts of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> into neat, versatile packages.</p>

<p>Samsung finally increased the size of the outer cover screen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> improves on that by making it even more useful than ever before. Samsung now lets you fit multiple widgets onto a single panel, although you still need to set up the external display using Labs or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> to get more use out of it.</p><p>At 3.4 inches, this screen is big enough to use a full-sized keyboard to reply to messages, run full apps, and just use the large, inner display less often. That&apos;s convenient for everyday use — it&apos;s certainly more glanceable than having to open the phone — plus, using a smaller display more often will inherently improve daily battery life since the phone doesn&apos;t have to power a big display every time you use it.</p><p>Although the Flip 6 is nearly identical to the Flip 5 in terms of dimensions and weight, we now get dust resistance on the modern flip phone. It&apos;s not very robust, but the IP48 rating is a welcome bump over the last-gen Flip&apos;s IPX8 rating. You also get the latest mobile processor — the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 — as well as a slightly larger 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>Samsung has also upgraded the cameras on the Z Flip 6, ditching the 12MP primary lens for a significantly better 50MP wide camera. Just don&apos;t expect to zoom in very far since there&apos;s still no telephoto lens. And finally, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 has been promised a whopping seven years of major OS and security updates. I just wish Samsung hadn&apos;t driven up the price by a whole $100.</p>

<p>The era of the mid-range foldable is finally upon us thanks to Motorola. This year&apos;s budget winner is the spectacular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Motorola Razr (2024)</a>, which basically a beefed-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-vs-razr-plus-2023">version of the Razr Plus (2023)</a> but for a stunningly low $700 price tag. That&apos;s $400 less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, making it the most affordable new foldable phone you&apos;ll find today. You&apos;ll be making some concessions by saving so much money, but it&apos;s likely this will only bother enthusiasts.</p><p>The Mediatek Dimensity 7300X processor inside is plenty snappy and likely will never show its "mid-range" nature, even when playing games like Honkai: Star Rail. But there&apos;s always the chance that you won&apos;t see the same super-high framerates that a more expensive foldable can achieve. Slower internal storage means that things will definitely take longer to load, though.</p><p>That slightly lower-powered processor paired with a 4,200mAh battery means you&apos;ll actually be able to get through a full day&apos;s use on a single charge, unlike most other flip-style foldables.</p><p>The external 3.6-inch 90Hz OLED display is the star of the show, easily taking on the flagship Z Flip 6 and kicking its butt in terms of functionality. You can do so much with the cover display that it&apos;s like having two phones in one. In fact, you can use the phone in its entirety without even opening up the main screen, because Motorola doesn&apos;t put any restrictions on what you can do with the cover display.</p><p>If an average camera isn&apos;t a true negative for you, this is an excellent way to get in on the flip trend and save a ton of money.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a> is two phones in one, outclassing the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in quite a few surprising ways. The biggest reason to choose the Razr Plus (2024) is the cover screen, which might initially be surprising because it looks <em>very </em>similar to what Samsung offers on the Flip 6.</p><p>So why is it so different if it&apos;s basically the same size? Motorola doesn&apos;t put any restrictions on what you can do with the cover display, which is why we say it&apos;s two phones in one. The smaller cover display on the front acts like a full phone so you can use the Razr Plus more often without having to open it up.</p><p>Yes, that sounds a little silly given how easy Motorola&apos;s hinge makes it to open and close on a whim, but there&apos;s just something nice about being able to use a smaller display for quick tasks. Plus, using that smaller screen more often will improve battery life. The phone&apos;s only real negative point is the lack of dust resistance.</p><p>In addition to a better cover screen, Motorola has two more hardware features that are better than Samsung&apos;s: the display crease, and the curved edges. The Razr Plus&apos;s display crease is basically non-existent compared to the Z Flip 6&apos;s. Sure, both phones fold flat and utilize a waterdrop display curve inside the hinge but Motorola does a much better job of hiding the crease. Plus, the curved edges of the phone make the Razr Plus so much easier to use and more comfortable to hold than Samsung&apos;s flat edges.</p><p>On the software side, Motorola&apos;s modern software update promise isn&apos;t nearly as good as Samsung&apos;s, promising three OS upgrades and four years of software updates. Motorola&apos;s timeless gestures are here in all their glory as well as a new Hello UX and Moto AI. Overall, it&apos;s a phenomenal phone and a great alternative to Samsung&apos;s Flip series.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> is the best large foldable you can buy today. Its size and shape fit somewhere in between the narrow Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the wide Pixel Fold, giving it that Goldilocks appeal. Plus, the display crease on the larger folding display is nearly invisible and you still get an IPX4 water resistance rating so you don&apos;t have to worry if it gets a little wet in the rain.</p><p>The displays are top-notch, as well, offering a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate, 1440Hz PWM dimming, 10-bit color depth, and peak brightness of 2,800 nits. There&apos;s even support for HDR10 and Dolby Vision for spectacular movie watching on that large, cinematic display inside.</p><p>OnePlus offers two great colors, with the Voyager Black colorway sporting a nice textured leather-like material on the back for extra grip. Surprisingly, even the cameras are quite excellent, surpassing the quality of even the best large foldables like the Google Pixel Fold in most tests.</p><p>But good foldable hardware only works as well as the software, and this is where OnePlus really does things right. While there were some weird bugs at launch, the experience these days is nothing short of the best you&apos;ll find anywhere, particularly when it comes to multitasking.</p><p>The brilliant OnePlus Open Canvas concept lets you run several apps at once using a split screen or a unique sliding app concept, where you can dock an app "off-screen" and slide it into the main view at any time. Think of it a bit like looking at a comic book with several frames, each frame containing an app, and you can freely move the frame around as needed. It&apos;s brilliant, and it rounds out the best large foldable you can buy.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is a bit of a stale update that doesn&apos;t justify the $100 price hike one bit. Sure, the crease on the internal display is barely visible anymore, but nearly every other spec mirrors the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Z Fold 5</a>.</p><p>Just like the older-gen Flip, the Z Flip 6 has a robust hinge, closes shut completely flat, and has a non-discernible crease. The screen now has a more durable FTG layer on top, bumping up the UTG found on the Fold 5. Adding to that, Samsung has finally upgraded the ingress protection of its foldables with the Fold 6&apos;s IP48 water and dust resistance. The Armor Aluminum frame is also enhanced for improved toughness.</p><p>Under the hood, the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor offers better battery life and faster processing. On the software side, users now get seven years of guaranteed platform and security updates. You get Android 14 (One UI 6.1.1) out of the box that&apos;s laden with Galaxy AI features. The Z Fold 6 supports the S Pen but you need to buy one separately and it still doesn&apos;t fit into the chassis of the phone like the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The novelties end there as Samsung retained the same old cameras, battery, and charging specs on the Fold 6 as the ones we saw on the Fold 5 and the Fold 4.</p><p>This is all very frustrating, and frankly, embarrassing for Samsung, especially considering the price increase. It is perplexing given how much better the cameras on the Google Pixel Fold and OnePlus Open are. We certainly expected Samsung to push the envelope with cameras this year and were pretty disappointed when we found out they didn&apos;t.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-the-best-foldable-phone-2">What&apos;s the best foldable phone?</h2>
<p>We rank the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 as the best foldable phone for most people because of its powerful processor, solid camera performance, good battery life, and large cover screen. Plus, Samsung&apos;s foldable phones have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-folding-test">proven to be more durable</a>, and capable of withstanding hundreds of thousands of folds more than the competition.</p><p>But a flip style isn&apos;t for everyone, and all of our staff who use foldables regularly prefer the larger form factors of the OnePlus Open or Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. These two phones give you the option of having a tablet-sized display when you need it with the pocketability of a standard phone the rest of the time.</p><p>Plus, companies like Samsung and OnePlus have created powerful multitasking software systems that make it a joy to use multiple apps at once on that big screen.</p>
<h2 id="are-foldable-phones-worth-it-2">Are foldable phones worth it?</h2>
<p>Any fledgling technology tends to cost more, which means that many people often get priced out of choosing a foldable phone as an option. Companies like OnePlus and Samsung often run great deals on their foldable phones, and trading in an older phone could get you hundreds off a new foldable.</p><p>But while large foldables tend to cost more, phones like the Motorola Razr have pushed the price of clamshell foldables to less than half the price they debuted at in 2019. That&apos;s a great track record for getting more foldables into people&apos;s hands affordably, and some even cheaper options from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">TECNO</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-disadvantages-of-foldable-phone-2">What are the disadvantages of foldable phone?</h2>
<p>Aside from price, foldable phones are more difficult to repair than traditional slab phones. Our own Andrew Myrick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">had several problems</a> getting his Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 repaired, and he&apos;s not alone in this conundrum. While many companies like Samsung partner up with shops like uBreakiFix, a broken display on a foldable is still a more difficult, costly process to repair.</p><p>We&apos;ve also seen plenty of examples where foldable displays crack without any obvious damage infliction point. When this happens, there&apos;s a possibility that it could be covered under warranty. The problem is that repair shops aren&apos;t always consistent with how they identify warranty-eligible replacements, and we&apos;ve run into these issues several times when trying to get foldables repaired over the years.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that, traditionally, foldable phones have worse battery life and camera quality than a similarly-priced slab phone.</p><p>While the situation is improving with every year — the OnePlus Open&apos;s camera is better than the OnePlus 12, despite being a few months older — companies like Samsung have been making snail-like progress on camera improvements over the years. That&apos;s particularly true with telephoto cameras, as the company ships the same cameras on its $1,900 Z Fold 6 as it fits on the $799 Galaxy S24.</p>
<h2 id="do-foldable-phones-last-long-2">Do foldable phones last long?</h2>
<p>Normally, a foldable phone will last you years without issue. Most foldable phones are rated for at least 200,000 consecutive folds before the hinge will start giving out, and companies like Samsung and OnePlus tout hundreds of thousands of folds beyond that before problems start to develop.</p><p>Foldables also tend to be more durable when dropped simply because the foldable display is encased within a protective clamshell.</p><p>But ultrathin foldable glass is still just ultrathin glass, and there&apos;s always the probability that it could break when you&apos;re using it normally, however unlikely that may be.</p>
