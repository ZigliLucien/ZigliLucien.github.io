<ul><li>Rumors suggest OnePlus is interested in making the Open 2 even thinner than the first model, which could bring it contention with Honor's Magic V3.</li><li>The device is "expected" to feature a 9.Xmm thinness when folded with a circular triple camera array, and a 2K Plus high-definition display.</li><li>Honor's Magic V3 is incredibly thin and durable as the company stated it measures 9.2mm when folded and 4.3mm unfolded.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New rumors claim consumers could have an interesting competition brewing between OnePlus and Honor following its thin Magic V3 foldable.</p><p>Known Weibo tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Ovgu56gT8?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) posted some rumors about the OnePlus Open 2, which purported its new thinner mentality. The information was recently edited away; however, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-open-2-thin-leak-3478093/">Android Authority</a> snapped a screenshot of it. According to the original rumor, DCS states a key aspect of OnePlus&apos; design for the Open 2 is to make it "even thinner and lighter."</p><p>Supposedly, the Chinese OEM is interested in producing a foldable with a thickness of 9.Xmm. This is rumored to be "expected" as development of the device continues. The tipster didn&apos;t give a specific number, though it should be relatively thinner than Honor&apos;s recent book-style foldable if it wants to beat it.</p><p>Other rumors claim the phone could feature a Sony 50MP primary sensor within its triple camera array. It&apos;s suggested that a periscope camera will join this. Additionally, it seems OnePlus is sticking with the large, circular array that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">its previous iteration</a> offered.</p><p>Lastly, a "2K Plus full high-definition" foldable screen is rumored for the Open 2 alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4.</p>

<p>The idea of a thinner foldable, especially one within the 9mm range, gets us thinking about the Honor Magic V3. The company detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-ultra-thin-durable-creation-details">how it made its ultra-thin foldable</a>, which measures 9.2mm when folded and 4.3mm unfolded. Honor stated that it invested heavily in the R&D side of its battery technology, implementing a 5,150mAh silicon carbon battery.</p><p>The company honed in on durability, an aspect of the previous model that consumers complained about. With the Magic V3, Honor added an additional set of "swing arms" for its hinge to boost its durability and longevity.</p><p>It remains to be seen just how much of a challenger OnePlus will be with the Open 2 against Honor. Rumors so far suggest it will be thinner than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold at 10.5mm and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 at 12.1mm.</p><p>Other OnePlus Open 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-tipped-to-have-a-6000mah-battery">rumors claim</a> the device could feature a beefed-up 6,000mAh battery. The current claims double down on the theory of Qualcomm&apos;s upcoming flagship SoC being featured within the device. Elsewhere, the Open 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-might-not-see-a-successor-this-year">may not arrive this year</a> as originally speculated. A tipster&apos;s post on X suggested that the next OnePlus foldable could arrive during Q1 2025.</p><p>The reason is supposedly due to OPPO, a OnePlus sister company, delaying the launch of its Find N5 until next year. Both foldables are likely to mirror one another like last year.</p>

<p>September is off to a fast start for Google as the company has started rolling out its monthly security update.</p><p>Despite a light September 2024 security update, Google is fixing two crucial problems with its Pixel lineup.

Fold, and the Pixel Tablet will see version <strong>AP2A.240905.003 </strong>while the 8a sees an <strong>A1</strong> tacked onto the end.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> users will find firmware version <strong>AD1A.240905.004</strong>.</p><p>While this patch brings the usual security improvements, one major fix involves the removal of a "third-party APK to address security vulnerability." This is a major issue, as Google states the security flaw affected its entire past-gen line of devices. The devices this fix is for involve the Pixel 6 series up to the Pixel 8.</p><p>The Pixel Fold and the Pixel Tablet were also affected and rectified.</p><p>Google&apos;s final fix involves an odd Wi-Fi problem. The changelog details that the fix should correct Wi-Fi "stability and performance." These were issues that Pixel 9 series users may have noticed as their devices arrived.</p>

<p>The post states the update is for all Android 14 devices and will roll out "in phases." Everyone won&apos;t see the patch simultaneously as Google delivers it per device and carrier.</p><p>Regarding the Pixel vulnerability, it was discovered in mid-August that a pre-loaded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-verizon-demo-app-vulnerability-details">Verizon demo app contained a file</a> that could expose a user&apos;s device to MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks. The only saving grace is that the app (and the file by extension) remained dormant on Pixel phones unless they were specifically enabled and granted permissions.</p><p>The Showcase.apk file was the culprit, which could&apos;ve given outside threats a way to "virtually inject" malware and spyware onto your Pixel phone.</p><p>With the Pixel 9&apos;s Wi-Fi problem seemingly squared away, there&apos;s still nothing further about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-rooting-unlocked-bootloader-problems-reported">unlocked bootloader issues</a>. Pixel 9 users quickly discovered that unlocking the bootloader breaks many of the new AI-powered features. Rooting the device caused similar problems. Pixel Screenshots, Pixel Studio, and the Pixel Weather app stopped working and displayed error messages.</p><p>The only way to get things working again would be to lock and unroot the device in question. It&apos;s an unfortunate development as unlocking the bootloader can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">bring a lot of good to users who desire it</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Consumers are just getting their hands on the flagship Pixel 9 series, but some interesting rumors have surfaced about its budget variant.</p><p>Kamila Wojciechowska writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-modem-3477459/">Android Authority</a> claims the upcoming Pixel 9a will not use the same modem as its flagship friends. The tipster claims Google&apos;s next budget phone will continue to use the Exynos Modem 5300 SoC that its Pixel 8 and Pixel 7 series featured last year.</p><p>The post notes how the Pixel 9a may miss out on the efficiency increases and cooling capabilities the Exynos Modem 5400 provides the flagship line.</p><p>The other side of these rumors involves Google&apos;s SoC, which will supposedly be a "slightly different" version. The publication states that the Tensor G4 packed in the Pixel 9 will hit the Pixel 9a; however, the "plastic package" will reportedly differ. The packaging method of an SoC can affect the performance of a chip.</p><p>More importantly, the difference in method can notably affect its heating/cooling capabilities. Kamila states the Pixel 9a&apos;s Tensor G4 could feature the IPoP packaging method instead of the flagship&apos;s FOPLP, which delivers a cooler experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N9Tp2Zhx5PPyKgEuw6AEVH" name="google-pixel-9-pro-obsidian-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-in-cases-02.jpg" alt="A Google Pixel 9 Pro in a Thinborne aramid fiber case and a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in an official Google case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N9Tp2Zhx5PPyKgEuw6AEVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s interesting about this potential packaging change for the Pixel 9a is that we&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7a-tensor-g2-alleged-packaging">similar behavior with the Pixel 7a</a>. It was stated in 2023 that Google opted for a "slightly worse" method for its budget device: IPOP. The other option was Samsung&apos;s FOPLP-PoP proprietary technology. Switching to IPOP could cause the device to heat up quicker than the other, negatively impacting the phone&apos;s performance.</p><p>IPOP is also "thicker and larger," according to Kamila&apos;s initial revelation about Google&apos;s packaging change last year. Whether Google decides to do the same for the Pixel 9a remains to be seen.</p><p>Elsewhere, Pixel 9a rumors continue as a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-alleged-real-life-photos-leak">alleged real-life images</a> leaked about it late last month. The device will seemingly sport Google&apos;s new boxy design like the flagship models, but a slight change could hit its rear panel. While the Pixel 9 series boasts a pretty large (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">and not-so-sorry</a>) camera bump, the 9a could take a minimalistic approach.</p><p>The photos show the bump could be incredibly small with two camera lenses and an LED flash on the outside of the array. There&apos;s no telling how this could affect the sensors (and megapixels) of the Pixel 9a. The design change is also quite different from Pixel A-series past as those phones typically remain close to the flagship line.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is expected to launch in Q2 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re a few months away from Samsung&apos;s next flagship series, but the latest rumors claim the market is in for a chip switch.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hankyung.com/article/2024090197421">Hankyung</a> (Korean) report purports Samsung is moving to drop its Exynos chip from the Galaxy S25 series for Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-snapdragon-8-gen-4-exclusive-ditch-exynos-report/">SamMobile</a>). This move will reportedly encompass the next flagship line&apos;s global release as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">has previously put forth</a> a dual-chip mentality.</p><p>While that typically left areas like Europe with its latest Exynos launch, the publication states this change concerns Samsung&apos;s competition.</p><p>The post adds that Samsung is teetering toward Qualcomm and its work toward bettering on-device AI to stay in contention with Apple and other Chinese OEMs. AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-magicpad-2-ai-math-equation-digitizer">in development by Honor</a> for its big IFA 2024 showcase could be an object of discussion.</p><p>Rumors continue, stating Samsung isn&apos;t ditching its next chip, the Exynos 2500, entirely. The publication states the company is moving to "use it in a foldable phone to be released in the second half of next year." Supposedly, this claim involves both the "tentatively" named Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 slated for next summer.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2500-soc-specs-leak">early specification leak</a> teased noteworthy performance and speed increases for Samsung&apos;s Exynos 2500. What followed were rumors stating this Exynos chip could make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency">for a closer rival</a> for Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. The chip will likely be built off a 3nm process with a single Cortex X-5 CPU ranging from 3.2 to 3.3GHz.</p><p>AMD&apos;s RDNA-based Xclipse 950 GPU may enter to boost its graphical capabilities.</p><p>What concerns a large breadth of flagship phones is Qualcomm&apos;s upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-power-hungry-rumor">might demand more</a> from your phone&apos;s battery. This hunger for power is reportedly caused by the chip&apos;s usage of a 2+6 core setup. Devices may need to jump to 6,000mAh, though some have been (supposedly) tested with a 5,500mAh capacity.</p><p>A Qualcomm executive confirmed the next chip will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">arrive in October</a> with Oryon CPU. This new CPU hardware is estimated to provide 2x more power and 4.5x faster AI processing.</p>

<p>Screenshots are possible on all phones. Once you have all the necessary screenshots, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-quickly-find-screenshots-google-photos">access them in Google Photos</a>. It&apos;s good that you have different methods, just in case you&apos;re having issues with one.Â You might be using Google Photos more often since you might not resist taking many pictures of the latest Pixel 9 series phones, including the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL. Older-gen Pixels are spectacular at photography too, so this applies to Google phones universally.</p><p>If you want the Pixel with the best camera out of the series, you can choose the 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL. They have the same specs and share a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera with autofocus, and a 48MP telephoto camera. The Pixel 9 Pro lacks a 48MP telephoto camera.</p><p>To access your screenshots, you can take the long or short way byÂ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-new-screenshot-folder-shortcut" target="_blank">long-pressing on the Google Photos app icon</a>.

These small Bluetooth tags are designed to attach to keys or placed in wallets, purses, or backpacks to keep track of valuables. Some people even use them on pet collars. But they can also be used by people for the wrong reasons.</p><p>Individuals can place a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth tracker</a> in your personal belongings to be able to track your location, unbeknownst to you and without your consent. They can be hidden away in a jacket pocket, for example, in the depths of your backpack, or even in your vehicle. Thankfully, thereâs a way to verify this isnât being done to you. In fact, your smartphone automatically notifies you if it detects an unknown one so you can take the appropriate steps.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-unknown-tracker-alert-2">What is an unknown tracker alert?</h2>
<p>If you turn this feature on for your device, you will receive an alert on your phone advising you that someone elseâs tracking device is traveling with you. This is a good way to help someone find something they lost. Maybe your wife forgot she gave you her keys, for example, or she left her headphones with a tracker in your car. But it also alerts you if someone placed a tracker on your person as soon as the owner of said tracker has moved their device outside of the range of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, putting your phone into Airplane Mode, turning off Bluetooth, or even shutting down location services wonât stop the person from being able to follow you (and thus the tracker). Unknown tracker alerts are typically on by default, but you can double-check in your phoneâs settings.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> on your device.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Unknown tracker alerts</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>Allow alerts</strong> if it isnât already on.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-manually-scan-for-unknown-trackers-2">How to manually scan for unknown trackers</h2>
<p>If you want to verify that no unknown trackers are near nor on or in your belongings and you havenât received an alert to indicate it, you can run a manual scan to be sure.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> on your device.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Unknown tracker alerts</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GCCB4f6uwJMeehGrFH3PxV" name="unknown tracker scan 1-3.jpg" alt="screenshots of unknown trackers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GCCB4f6uwJMeehGrFH3PxV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Select <strong>Scan now</strong>. The scan will take about 10 seconds to complete. Once done, youâll see a list of any trackers that might be nearby.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Play sound</strong> to help you locate it.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-find-an-unknown-tracker-2">What to do if you find an unknown tracker</h2>
<p>If you find an unknown tracker from a brand like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tile-bluetooth-trackers-review">Tile</a>, Apple, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">Samsung</a>, or others, and you believe someone has used it for the purpose of tracking you, tap the unknown tracker notification and a map will open. Here, youâll see where it has been following you. Select <strong>Play sound</strong> to emit an audible beep from the tracker, which will first help you find where it is. Continue to do this and follow the sound to locate the device. Once you find the tracker, select <strong>Next steps</strong>.</p><p>While you might be tempted to disable it right away, if you feel you could be in danger, contact local law enforcement first. Disabling the tracker could return the device to factory settings, which would remove the history of ownership. If you want to disable it for any reason (note that the owner would still be able to see your last location), this usually can be done by opening the tracker and removing its battery.</p><p>Some trackers, however, like certain Tile or Pebblebee models, donât have replaceable or removable batteries. In this case, only the owner can disable it. If youâre concerned, take a photo of the device, including its serial number, leave it behind, and head to a police station or contact local police or a trusted friend or family member for help.</p><p>Keep in mind as well that tracking is not foolproof. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-responds-find-my-device-criticism">recent tests of Google&apos;s Find My Device network</a>, we found that while friends were alerted that unknown trackers were following them, the owner did not hear anything about the locations for weeks. What&apos;s more, Google Find My Device doesn&apos;t always show the exact location of the tracker on the map in the app. This means bad actors might not be able to follow you as well as they&apos;d like anyway.</p><p>So, since that system relies on kind-hearted people finding the tracker and getting in touch with the owner, it&apos;s set to work as intended. And it has less chance of being used for bad reasons. Google tells us the company is working on improving the crowdfunded network. As it gets more precise, you can be more diligent by learning how to determine if unknown trackers are following you.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">best Bluetooth trackers</a> are designed to help you keep track of lost or misplaced items. Sadly, sometimes people can use them for nefarious purposes. But keeping an eye on what trackers are near you if you ever feel unsafe is a good way to prevent that.</p>

<ul><li>Mobvoi has started rolling out its Wear OS 4 update, which has been a long time coming for TicWatch Pro 5 and Pro 5 Enduro owners.</li><li>The update offers two new features and several enhancements for TicExercise and TicMotion.</li><li>Mobvoi is a year late in bringing its Wear OS 4 update to Pro 5 owners, which sucks because everyone is getting excited about Wear OS 5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s finally here; Mobvoi has started rolling out its major Wear OS 4 update for all TicWatch Pro 5 series owners.</p><p>Mobvoi stated in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobvoi.com/au/blog/Wear-OS-4-Upgrade-and-Enhanced-Functionality-for-TicWatch-Pro-5-Series?_id=66d6bfb9a743410012e83485">a blog post</a> that its Wear OS 4 update is starting to arrive on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Pro 5 Enduro</a>. These devices have been rocking Wear OS 3.5 for a while now and this next OS release kicks things off with new features. Mobvoi states both watches are preparing to receive "Backup and Restore."</p><p>This will let users seamlessly "backup your data and settings from your old watch while keeping all of your data, settings, and watch faces in place." Phone Transfer is a lifesaver as users can easily swap their watch from one phone to another <em>without </em>factory resetting it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> update brings a long list of enhancements for the TicWatches, beginning with TicExercise. There are 25 new exercises users can start getting into with their devices. A few include hiking, pickleball, CrossFit, and stair stepper. Workout data for outside exercises will display more data like GPS, distance, and speed.</p><p>Customizable workout lists and auto-pause join alongside changes in the UI and "calorie calculation."</p><p>TicMotion picks up a few enhancements for cycling detection, enhanced data detection, and the ultra-low power display now shows a workout tile.</p><p>A few more updates are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Multi-language Translation Enhancements</strong>: Optimizations to the translation of multiple languages.</li><li><strong>Watch Face Customization</strong>: Customizable watch face styles, colors, and complications. (TicWatch Pro 5 owners)</li><li><strong>Custom Button Functionality</strong>: Side button now supports customization to open a user-defined app (default is the recent apps list). (TicWatch Pro 5 owners)</li><li><strong>Other Bug Fixes</strong>: General bug fixes and stability improvements.</li></ul>

<p>Mobvoi adds that its Wear OS 4 update brings the latest September 2024 patch for its two Pro 5 watches. More importantly, the update has started today (Sept 3); however, it may take some time before it hits your watch.</p><p>It&apos;s no hiding that Mobvoi TicWatch owners have become <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-waiting-game">weary of the Wear OS waiting game</a>. The company was incredibly slow in rolling out the Wear OS 3 update and that continued as we&apos;re just getting Wear OS 4. Mobvoi kickstarted its beta period for the software <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">earlier this year</a> in April.</p><p>TicWatch users were late to the party as Wear OS 4 originally launched a year ago. What makes things strange is that we&apos;re waiting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5</a> to start hitting more devices. It seems that Google is starting to get the memo and bring more consistency to its Wear OS ecosystem. This could mean we&apos;re in for major yearly Wear OS updates, though we&apos;ll have to see how things go.</p><p>This also means that Mobvoi will likely have to step things up as we progress.</p>

<p>Mobvoi's TicWatch Pro 5 might hit all the notes you're expecting a smartwatch to hit. After a long wait, the TicWatch Pro 5 delivers incredible performance for all your wearable apps and tools. The watch also offers multi-day battery life, which is a privilege in this day and age. Now, with Wear OS 4 finally here, the TicWatch Pro 5 can utilize the power and features it missed out on for a while.</p></p>

<hr>
<p>Before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> even officially launched, we were hearing rumors of a thinner and more premium variant set for release in the fall. At the time, it was being referred to as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Slim," due to it being a thinner version of the regular model. In the time since, both Google and Honor released similar foldables that are thinner than both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the unreleased model, per reports.</p><p>That&apos;s why Samsung may be switching up the name of its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">flagship foldable</a>. Indications are now that it will be called the Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Special Edition," which seems like a better name than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim. Samsung couldn&apos;t call its upcoming foldable the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim because it simply isn&apos;t thin enough, and it would&apos;ve been ridiculed. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">Honor already gloriously trolled Samsung</a> for the thickness of its latest foldable with a tiny message roasting the Galaxy Z Fold 6.Â </p><p>But for similar reasons, the Special Edition might not be very special. In fact, it may end up just being the Galaxy Z Fold 6 model that Samsung should&apos;ve released in the first place. The latest leaks come from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1828490254686237142" target="_blank">Evan Blass on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, although his account is currently private. They point to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition including a slightly slimmer form factor and an upgraded rear camera system.</p><p>That last bit could be crucial, because there isn&apos;t a single foldable available in North America that has a camera system capable of competing with those of flagships. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> has a worse camera than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a worse camera than the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the OnePlus Open has a worse camera than the OnePlus 12. Samsung is the worst offender, because its $1,900 folding phone has the same rear camera system as the $800 base Galaxy S24. It&apos;s also going on its third year without changes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Xj3YsQESa6GgbXpfgX3a7H" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16x9.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xj3YsQESa6GgbXpfgX3a7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest report from Blass indicates that the Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s 50MP main camera could be swapped for a 200MP sensor on the Special Edition. If you recall, the same was reported when a Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Ultra" model was rumored. This sensor might also support 2x optical zoom, and it&apos;s possible it is the same ISOCELL HP3 camera within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. For now, it&apos;s unclear whether the Special Edition might receive telephoto or ultrawide camera upgrades.Â </p><p>If the Special Edition indeed features a 200MP main camera sensor, and the marketing surrounds that change, it would make a lot more sense than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim branding.Â There have been mixed reports about the thickness of Samsung&apos;s next foldable, but the most recent figures are that it measures 11.5mm when folded. That still puts it considerably behind the Honor Magic V3 and even the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.Â </p>

<p>I have no doubts that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition will be a better foldable than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, the details surrounding both models underscore how far behind Samsung is in foldable technology. Neither the standard Galaxy Z Fold 6 nor the rumored Special Edition variant are set to challenge top foldables from Honor, Vivo, and others. It won&apos;t even top the charts in every area stateside, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> still dominating in their own ways.Â </p><p>If anything, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 should become the budget Samsung foldable we&apos;ve always wanted, with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition becoming the premium variant. Samsung&apos;s current foldable is far too expensive for the features it offers, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition could be more worthy of that $1,900 price point. Unfortunately, we don&apos;t expect Samsung to shave dollars off the Galaxy Z Fold 6 price tag anytime soon. In fact, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition might be exclusive to Korea and China, so it won&apos;t meaningfully impact North American sales at all.Â </p><p>To really be competitive, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition would need a more powerful camera system, a much slimmer chassis, and a better form factor. Built-in S Pen storage would be an unlikely but significant feature. While the Special Edition might offer one or two of these, it&apos;s not going to offer all of them. Even Samsung&apos;s best is behind the curve in 2024 when it comes to foldables.Â </p>
