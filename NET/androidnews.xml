<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><p>On Thursday (June 10), Samsung announced its first-ever budget Galaxy Watch FE, which the company claims is both "stylish and durable" but comes with health monitoring features that consumers need. </p><p>The watch is available in one size, 40mm, and has a 1.2-inch Super AMOLED display. The wearable is nearly identical to the Galaxy Watch 4, except that it features Sapphire Crystal Glass. It also has a BioActive Sensor to help users keep tabs on their health and fitness data. </p><p>The company states the sensor will deliver "actionable" tips to stay active throughout the day. Other features include the Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification (IHRN), which notifies users of potential signs of Afib, and an option to perform a quick ECG. The Galaxy Watch FE (Bluetooth) will be available on June 24 for $199.99, and its LTE variant will be available later this year for $249.99.</p>

To start, the full specs of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> have leaked, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-specs-leak-ahead-of-paris-unpacked/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a> blew off the lid with screenshots revealing that the device will keep the 6.3-inch cover display as its predecessor but in terms of the aspect ratio (22:9) and resolution (2,376 x 968) at a possible wider external screen. </p><p>The device will allegedly have the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3"> Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC and retain 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The Z Fold 6’s camera system also mirrors the setup on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. The leak suggests that it will have the same triple rear camera: a 50MP main sensor (f/1.8), a 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 10MP telephoto (f/2.4) with 3x optical zoom. The front cameras also appear unchanged, with a 10MP sensor (f/2.2) on the cover display and a 4MP sensor (f/1.8) under the internal display.</p><p>That&apos;s not all. We also got a glimpse of the Unpacked event countdown. Leaker Evan Blass shared a GIF of what looks like an official Samsung countdown on his X account. It shows that the event is set for July 10 at 10 PM Korean Standard Time (KST). Since Samsung is a significant sponsor of the Olympics in Paris, the Galaxy foldables launch is tipped to happen simultaneously.</p>

This feature protects your device from a hacker tactic called "juice jacking," which uses USB charging cables to sneak in malware, run unauthorized commands, install unwanted apps, or mess up your data.</p><p>Juice jacking is a risk every Android user may face due to the widespread availability of USB charging ports. This cyberattack exploits the phone&apos;s single port for power and data transfer. Using a compromised public station can allow hackers to install malware, steal personal data, or take full control of your phone.</p><p>To enable this protection, Beta users should hold the power button and select "Lockdown" from the Power menu (if your settings allow it). One tap activates a digital shield around your data.</p>

<p><strong>Read more on the Pixel phone update </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and watch </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This week, Pixel devices were in for a whole slew of updates. Google is bringing some useful user-facing features to its Pixels, such as display port support. With a USB-C cable, Pixel users can now watch movies and shows on a larger, secondary display, much like mirroring your screen. </p><p>Pixel users are now picking up "power-off Finding" through the Find My Device network that will help users locate their Pixel 8 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> devices, even if they&apos;re turned off, for several hours and away from the user. Up next, in the "Recents" tab in the Phone app, users can find that unknown caller, tap the number, and tap "Lookup." The search will begin from there, delivering any relevant information users need about that unknown phone number.</p><p>Some camera improvements are also coming your way as Pixel users. The company states this new feature will let Pixel owners find the "best moment from your photo in HDR Plus with just a single shutter."  This is intended for users to pick the best shot. </p><p>Users will also receive an update that brings more detailed summaries to the Pixel Recorder app, along with the Gemini Nano AI model appearing as a developer option for the Pixel 8 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>Pixel Watches weren&apos;t left behind; they received some updates as well. The popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel-4">car crash detection</a> feature that was only on Pixel phones is now available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, with the latest feature drop. Pixel Watch 2 users can now dial emergency services if they get into a severe car crash. Secondly, both Pixel Watch models&apos; can link their Paypal account to the wallet app. Google is also bringing the home app to Wear OS 3 and above-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>. It allows users to easily access their smart home devices faster and easier from their wrists.</p>

The tech giant announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/279861132/extended-repair-program-for-pixel-8?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">Pixel Phone Help page</a> that some Pixel 8 phones are having display issues, which has prompted them to raise their warranty.  If users have an issue with their Pixel 8 screens, you&apos;re covered for three years from the date you purchased the device.</p><p>However, it is important to note that not everyone will qualify for the extended warranty. Google or an authorized repair partner will run a diagnostic check using your device&apos;s serial number to see if it’s eligible. Pixel 8 owners whose devices don’t qualify for the extended warranty might still be covered under Google&apos;s standard limited warranty if they have similar display issues. </p>

<p>I&apos;m not saying anything Apple has to offer is good or bad, and since I don&apos;t use an iPhone, it doesn&apos;t affect me personally.

<p>There are a few negatives to consider. Apple has to rely on another company to meet its standards for user privacy and diligence to protect the data once it gets sent off. They threw out fancy ways of saying the company does the same things others do, knowing that journalists would quote them instead of asking questions—it&apos;s called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/efs-encrypted-file-systems/encryption-of-data-in-transit.html">encryption in transit</a>, and it is an industry standard—and that&apos;s great. It&apos;s how user data is supposed to be protected.</p>

<p>Still, embedding their small-scale agent on the device and then calling on third parties is not the same as doing it all in-house. Apple has to depend on others to do the right thing, and Apple never does that.</p>
<p>The companies will. When you&apos;re someone like OpenAI, you can&apos;t afford to play too loose with user data because the internet will call you on it. Using a third party over an in-house solution will be fine, and we&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">Microsoft do it</a> with no real issues. OpenAI or Google or any other AI company isn&apos;t going to do anything Apple wouldn&apos;t approve of and I&apos;m not implying it. If anything, Apple just gambled and waited too long, and this is how it has to fix it.</p><p>Apple knew it had to eventually build out user-facing AI on the iPhone. Not doing so when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">every competitor offers it</a> makes Apple look lazy, and the reality-distortion field can&apos;t work forever. What it didn&apos;t do was work on its own generative AI platform.</p>
<p>Did it need to? No, not really. Apple is a different company than Google; outsourcing is easy, cost-efficient, and works well. Ask Microsoft. Apple made the right choice and focused on tools that will mostly work, be easy to implement, and make users happy.</p><p>The next logical step would be building out a full-scale generative AI solution as a follow-up. Apple could do this; the company can easily attract the right talent to develop the next Google Gemini or ChatGPT and can afford the infrastructure to power it. People would use it, too—even people without an iPhone. The question is, will they?</p>

<p>Sending calls out to a third party through the operating system isn&apos;t the same as bundling in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-manage-youtube-app-android">YouTube app</a>. It leaves an impression that OpenAI is somehow more capable than Apple because Apple is willing to include ChatGPT as part of Siri. Like custom colors for icons, we would have never seen this when Steve Jobs was at the helm.</p><p>Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Neither; it&apos;s just a thing. Maybe we should get used to it, and Apple will become more like other tech companies, little-by-little. Or maybe this is an emergency solution while Apple builds the next breakthrough AI platform.</p>
<p>This has done one thing: It has made people who were not interested in Apple&apos;s previous phones curious. An iPhone seems like a great product, but it isn&apos;t for me. I don&apos;t like Apple&apos;s way of doing things. But I&apos;m interested in seeing how all the new features work. That means what Apple is doing is good for business and good for the industry as a whole.</p><p>Maybe moving on from the Steve Jobs era is an equally good thing for Apple.</p>

And yet, here we are with the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2, a pair of earbuds that look and feel a lot like their predecessors, only this time with extra features that would&apos;ve been nice to have in the first place.</p><p>The good thing is Jabra didn&apos;t break anything in its attempt to create a more expansive take on the Elite 10, making these Gen 2 earbuds among the best you can place in your ears. It&apos;s just a strange situation, considering the brand is also stepping away from its consumer audio business with this launch.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jabra-elite-10-gen-2-price-and-availability"><span>Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Un86zeaoaBJwEuxvKn7vmU" name="Jabra-Elite-10-gen-2.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Un86zeaoaBJwEuxvKn7vmU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jabra)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jabra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabras-new-elite-earbuds-come-with-a-case-thats-more-than-meets-the-eye">launched</a> the Elite 10 Gen 2 in June 2024, and should be widely available in retail and online stores until the company discontinues them. They start out at $280, though look out for potential price cuts at certain points along the way if retailers look to unload inventory. Despite exiting the consumer earbud space, Jabra says it will continue to support and update existing earbuds, including this pair, for "years." They come in glossy black, titanium black, soft white, cocoa, and denim.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jabra-elite-10-gen-2-what-s-good"><span>Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2: What's good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ju8st4KK2wWtY7W4jiibYJ" name="Jabra-Elite-10-Gen-2-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 from side view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ju8st4KK2wWtY7W4jiibYJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Elite 10 Gen 2 look like carbon copies of their predecessors, right down to the construction, placement details, and the case as well. The dimensions are the same, as are the ear tips. Indeed, ear tips from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">original Jabra Elite 10</a> will fit perfectly on these Gen 2 buds, maintaining the tight continuity that shows in many ways while wearing them.</p><p>They were already so comfortable to begin with, so there was no need to change how these fit. Still comfortable and easy on the ears, the rubberized coating remains an excellent design choice, as is the IP57 rating for dust and water resistance. It&apos;s rare for earbuds that aren&apos;t distinctly marketed as "sports" or "active" to have this level of protection, so it&apos;s a big plus out of the box if you&apos;re looking for a pair to run or work out in. You get four pairs of ear tips included to find the right fit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZFfe8PwWCTWxt77vsmMExJ" name="Jabra-Elite-10-Gen-2-with-laptop.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 case plugged into MacBook laptop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFfe8PwWCTWxt77vsmMExJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jabra focused a lot on usability as a way to augment the existing foundation, so there&apos;s less of a focus on re-engineering how good the Gen 2 sound. A prime example is turning the case into a Bluetooth LE smart case, basically letting you plug it into any USB-C or 3.5mm jack and wirelessly stream the audio (via the LC3 codec) over to the earbuds. Where would this be useful? Think about airplane entertainment screens or even your TV at home when you don&apos;t want to disturb anyone. Some exercise equipment also offers a way to plug in and listen, and this makes it easier to do cord-free.</p><p>The Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds aren&apos;t the first to offer this kind of setup, as I&apos;ve heard it before from LG and Bowers & Wilkins, in particular. Jabra goes the extra mile by including spatial audio and head tracking in the mix. Not only can you listen to audio through the case, but you also get a virtual surround sound effect to go with it.</p><p>It works very well, and since Jabra&apos;s cable includes both USB-C and 3.5mm extensions, you can pretty much plug it into any playback device. I tested it on a number of devices, including those without a headphone jack, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a>, and it worked perfectly. Same with laptops and my TV, including when using a USB-C-to-USB-A adapter. Take the earbuds out of their case, plug the case into the USB or headphone jack, and hold down the case&apos;s button until a white light appears, and you should hear the connection ping. </p>

<p>Jabra does a good job implementing all this without much fuss. Even if you&apos;re listening to audio streamed through the case, you can still take phone calls because the Elite 10 Gen 2 don&apos;t lose the connection to your phone. Multipoint connections already exist here, letting you pair with two devices simultaneously, so this just feels like a nice extension of that.</p><p>Moreover, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">LE Audio</a> carries an additional advantage in reducing latency through the LC3 codec, which you may find more obvious when plugging the case into devices using an older Bluetooth version. Computers definitely come to mind for that, as do TVs, where LE Audio improves audio/video sync. This is great for watching a show or during video calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="xuH9jWmjnSgLDvVvjYQnFH" name="Jabra-Elite-10-Gen-2-close-up.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbud close up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xuH9jWmjnSgLDvVvjYQnFH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can tell Jabra didn&apos;t change how it tuned the Elite 10 Gen 2, but it&apos;s evident the company chose to improve audio through other means. A big one is active noise cancelation (ANC). Jabra previously claimed that the Elite 10 were 2x better than their predecessors (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-review">Elite 7 Pro</a>) and is now making the same 2x claim with the Elite 10 Gen 2 over their first-gen counterparts.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to be precise about this sort of thing during testing, but I can say that ANC is better in the areas where Jabra says it should be, which is in mid-range and low-frequency noise. Droning noises like fans or engines won&apos;t seep in as much this time, and the variances in street noise diminish as well. Not to mention, the Wind Reduction mode adds another level to block background noise, but you have to toggle it on separately through the app. Total ANC results still won&apos;t match what the likes of Sony and Bose can deliver, but they are definitely a step in the right direction.</p><p>HearThrough is also better at piping in more natural ambient noise, making it easier to hear announcements or talk to someone clearly without taking the earbuds off. An offshoot of that is that phone calls feel a little more natural because you can hear your own voice a little more now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1015px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.37%;"><img id="xN9KUrmeNHcohpTPJnZ44H" name="Jabra-Elite-10-Gen-2-screenshots.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 screenshots in Sound+ app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xN9KUrmeNHcohpTPJnZ44H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1015" height="1100" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jabra also places more emphasis on spatial audio this time around. Any tuning from the company&apos;s engineers clearly focused on this area. The previous Elite 10 already support Dolby Atmos, so what you&apos;re getting here is more refined tuning and clarity. I would argue you&apos;ll hear it more watching a show or movie in Dolby Atmos than you would while listening to music on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">streaming services</a> like Amazon Music, Apple Music, or Tidal. </p><p>Spatial audio also applies when using the case&apos;s LE Audio, adding another nice perk in tying together the two features. Head tracking is exclusive to the Elite 10 Gen 2, as the sportier Elite 8 Gen 2 only offer standard Dolby Atmos. That also feels a little smoother here, particularly in how the spatial effect calibrates for head movement. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The app is still a very useful resource to get the most out of these earbuds.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Jabra still holds an edge over many competitors in that it manages to offer a high level of protection and still retain physical button controls. They&apos;re still very effective because of how easy they are to press and manage, and you can always customize them further in the Sound+ app. </p><p>The app is still a very useful resource for getting the most out of these earbuds. You can always adjust how you want them to sound through the onboard EQ, which is a must. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> is natively available, as is Spotify Tap. </p><p>Battery life hasn&apos;t really changed, lasting up to six hours with ANC on and eight hours when it&apos;s off. The case has an extra three charges and supports wireless charging—even while using it in LE Audio. For a quick wired charge, plug it in for five minutes, and you get up to an hour of playback.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nESeQkvx4ASonBs8q3r4wH" name="Jabra-Elite-10-Gen-2-loose-earbuds.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds loose in front of open case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nESeQkvx4ASonBs8q3r4wH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Going back to what made the previous Elite 10 so good is a smart move, but also a missed opportunity. The Elite 10 Gen 2 still don&apos;t offer support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> Bluetooth codecs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">aptX</a> Adaptive or LDAC, cutting out the chance to listen to higher-quality streams. I tried to see if LE Audio with the case changes that but to no avail. You&apos;ll naturally get the spatial audio effect but not hi-res.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t really correlate with the increased price for what are largely iterative earbuds rather than newly designed and engineered replacements. </p><p>And then there&apos;s the huge elephant in the room, which is that Jabra has no plans to make new consumer earbuds after these and the Elite 8 Active Gen 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/gn-kills-jabra-elite-and-talk-products">killing off the Elite brand of earbuds</a>. I don&apos;t know all the details yet, given that Jabra has previously indicated that this part of its business turns a profit, but I suspect it&apos;s about the money. Hearing aid and enterprise audio tech have much higher margins, so perhaps the powers that be at Jabra figure it&apos;s better to invest in building that portfolio further.</p>

<p>Jabra&apos;s move feels all the more puzzling, considering the Elite 10 Gen 2 clearly deserve to be among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. It built on a solid and reliable foundation and tweaked the feature set and performance to compete with the best. But maybe that hill is getting steeper to climb. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sony-wf-1000xm5-launch">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> are still the cream of the crop for the combination of sound quality and noise cancelation, as well as spatial audio and personalized listening. </p><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are in a similar boat, boasting arguably the best ANC you&apos;ll find on earbuds in most situations. You don&apos;t get the same level of granular controls Sony or Jabra offer, but there&apos;s a lot to like anyway. If you&apos;d rather stay in the proverbial family and pay less, the previous Elite 10 are a good buy.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want good sound with ANC support.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit with physical buttons.</li>
  <li>You like the idea of LE Audio.</li>
  <li>You want spatial audio.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You really want hi-res audio codecs.</li>
  <li>You don&apos;t care for spatial audio and head tracking.</li>
  <li>You want longer battery life.</li>
  <li>You hate that Jabra is leaving the business.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, Jabra put these earbuds in a weird place. I&apos;ve been a journalist for a long time, and rarely, if ever, have I seen a company launch a flagship product only to announce it was leaving that business behind at the same time. The silver lining is that the company intends to keep supporting its consumer products for years to come with firmware and software updates. We have some evidence for this when looking at how good the Elite 75t and Elite 7 Pro still are years later.</p><p>Even so, that&apos;s cold comfort for those who really enjoyed what Jabra was doing in this space every year. With that in mind, the Elite 10 Gen 2 are still excellent earbuds across the board. They improve some key features from the previous pair and maintain the comfort and durability that make them unique in a crowded market. While Jabra may be abandoning that market, you won&apos;t lose out if you choose to go with these earbuds as your next pair.</p>

The smartwatch features more or less the same specs, chipset, and design as the 2021 model, with the exception of a new sapphire glass over the display for better scratch protection. However, while a Galaxy Watch 4 reboot may seem like a strange move for Samsung, I think it&apos;s kind of genius. In fact, it&apos;s exactly what Wear OS needs: more affordable smartwatches.</p><p>I&apos;ve been reviewing Wear OS smartwatches for several years, and I&apos;ve often winced at the prices some of these companies charge for these devices. Fossil, which pulled an LG and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-exit-shows-platform-improvements-less-competitive">left the smartwatch business</a> earlier this year, used to charge $299 for the Fossil Gen 6, which didn&apos;t even run Wear OS 3 at launch and had very questionable performance. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Watches now cost more than ever, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Watch 5 Pro</a> model priced in the same ballpark as a cheap Android phone and even the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> giving me pause (don&apos;t even get me started on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/montblanc-summit-3-with-wear-os-3-announced">Montblanc Summit 3</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fuVP42LF5An82C5MHpndTg" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Pro-3.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fuVP42LF5An82C5MHpndTg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The only exception I&apos;ve seen is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-e3-review">TicWatch E3</a>, which launched a few years back. That watch featured a relatively cheap build and skipped out on the best features found on more expensive TicWatch models, like the dual-display tech, but the price kind of made it worth it. At $199, you got a smartwatch that was much cheaper than the competition and performed surprisingly well with the Snapdragon Wear 4100, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-3-rollout">Wear OS 3 coming much later</a>.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;m a little bummed we haven&apos;t gotten a TicWatch E4 or some equivalent, especially now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> is here and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is on the way, both of which likely require newer chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a>. But seeing Samsung launch the Galaxy Watch FE gives me some hope that cheaper Wear OS watches could be a thing again if companies play their cards right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pijN8QWdPijHNrru7JhWLg" name="ticwatch-e3-lifestyle-landscape-crop.jpg" alt="TicWatch E3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pijN8QWdPijHNrru7JhWLg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees, saying that launching the cheaper smartwatch was a smart move on Samsung&apos;s part. "I think the Galaxy Watch FE allows Samsung and its partners to offer a cheaper option that can be easily discounted or given away for free as a bundle item and broadens the price range of products it&apos;s offering for wearables."</p><p>I&apos;m not saying every cheap Wear OS smartwatch has to be a rebranded version of an older model, but I do think companies should have affordability in mind when developing upcoming models. At $349.99, the Pixel Watch 2 is asking for a lot, and that&apos;s not even with LTE. If I didn&apos;t already have one, I would have a hard time justifying spending that money on it, and honestly, I&apos;m still trying to figure out if it&apos;s worth it (don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s a really great smartwatch). But I would love to see a future Pixel Watch 3a that features a toned-down Snapdragon chip and some other compromises, especially if it means spending only $199 to be part of the Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Keep in mind that Google just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> for $229, and Qualcomm already gives smartphone OEMs cheaper alternatives of its chips, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, so both companies could very well make it happen. Apple already sells the more affordable Apple Watch SE, which was apparently good enough to warrant an upgraded model two years later, so I would love to see more Android OEMs follow suit. Sag notes the importance of launching cheaper models, as it allows people to make decisions based on price<strong> </strong>"and doesn&apos;t price certain people out of the market because their appetite for spending on a smartwatch is less than $299." </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Watch FE is a blueprint for how other companies can approach making cheaper Wear OS watches.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is why the lack of cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> is a glaring omission for me, especially as companies stuff more features in their devices to drive the price up. Wear OS doesn&apos;t have the same reputation as WatchOS, and while that&apos;s starting to change, I&apos;m not convinced too many people are clamoring to shell out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin</a> or Apple Watch amounts of money for a Wear OS smartwatch. It&apos;s good that we have premium smartwatches that perform well, but Wear OS also needs to be more financially accessible.</p><p>This also goes for companies such as OnePlus, which is rumored to have a potentially budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> variant launching soon. Then there&apos;s Motorola, which has stayed away from Wear OS on its budget-friendly smartwatches. However, a new Wear OS model from the company would be perfect, as it already makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best affordable phones</a> on the market.</p><p>That said, Sag warns that while there should be more affordable Wear OS models, there should also be a happy medium and that companies need to be careful. "I do think it’s a problem, but I also believe that if you go too cheap, the experience gets really bad and not worth making. Kind of like most really cheap smartphones."</p>

<p>One of the reasons Android is so great is because it caters to everyone, from those willing to spend an arm and a leg on a new phone to those who just want something with the basics that doesn’t break the bank. Now that Wear OS is finally coming into its own with big players like Samsung and Google at the helm, the same philosophy should be applied to the wearable platform to help it reach more people.</p>

<ul><li>Google's latest Pixel Feature Drop for June 2024 adds a feature called Lookup to the Phone app. </li><li>The new button simplifies the process of reverse-searching phone numbers, and it's helpful for figuring out whether a call you missed is worth a call back.</li><li>It's live in the latest Phone by Google app beta, and should be expanding to all users soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently announced everything included in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">June Pixel Feature Drop</a>, and one of the smaller features is called Lookup. It&apos;s a new tool in the Phone by Google app that&apos;ll make it easier for users to find out who&apos;s behind an unknown number. While it might not be as exciting as other features included in the Pixel Feature Drop, like display output support, it&apos;s still a notable addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best smartphones</a>. Having a way to reverse-search a phone number can save you time and stress by letting you know whether it&apos;s worth calling someone back. </p><p>Lookup was announced with the recent Feature Drop, but it&apos;s not available for everyone yet. For now, it&apos;s included in the Phone by Google app for beta testers. We saw it in version 133 of the beta, but it was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/google-phone-lookup-pixel/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> in version 132. After installing the Google Phone app beta, you&apos;ll see a new fourth option underneath your recent missed calls when you select them. </p><p>Previously, tapping a missed call in the <strong>Recents</strong> tab of the Phone by Google app presented three options: <strong>Add contact</strong>, <strong>Message</strong>, and <strong>History</strong>. To search for a phone number, users needed to manually copy the number and search it in Google or the browser of their choice. Some people certainly used this method, but you needed to be "in the know" for it to work. There wasn&apos;t anything on the phone by Google app that told you how to reverse-search a phone number. </p><p>Now, that fourth option — <strong>Lookup</strong> — does just that. It&apos;s a new button in the Phone by Google that takes the effort out of the process of looking up a phone number. While the feature isn&apos;t groundbreaking by itself, the important part of this is that Lookup is now front-and-center in the Phone by Google app. More people will see it, more people will use it, and hopefully more people will avoid wasting time on scammers because of it. </p>

<p>The Phone by Google app already has some protections against scam calls within, like adding a <strong>Scam Risk</strong> tag in the Caller ID when a number is known to be associated with scams. Your cellular carrier might offer some protection, too. However, there isn&apos;t anything to help you figure out whether an unknown number or missed call is worth a call back from the Google Phone app. That&apos;s where Lookup comes in. After trying it on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, this might save users quite a bit of time. </p><p>The way it works is simple. When you see a missed call in the <strong>Recents</strong> tab of the Phone by Google app, you probably don&apos;t know what it&apos;s about — especially if the call is from an unknown number and the person didn&apos;t leave a voicemail message. Even if they did leave a message, it may be misleading. Law enforcement agencies across the U.S. have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alexandriava.gov/sheriff/sheriffs-office-warns-of-fraudsters-impersonating-law-enforcement-in-phone-scam" target="_blank">issued warnings</a> over the last few months about phone scams involving police impersonation, where scammers use real names, addresses, and offices to trick unknowing citizens. One way to verify if a call is legitimate is to use the Lookup feature.</p><p>Tapping the Lookup button immediately opens a page in Google Search that&apos;ll help you find out more about where a call came from. Using the full phone number, including country code, Google may pull up results explaining the origin of your missed call. In one of our tests, Google wasn&apos;t able to tell us anything about an unknown number. </p><p>However, in another test, Lookup in Phone by Google worked exactly as intended. It told me that the missed call was from a county government office in Germany. Since I&apos;ve had no connection to Germany, I now know that the call was either an honest mistake or a scam, and there&apos;s no reason to call back. Spoofing a phone number is easier than ever, and it&apos;s entirely possible that a scammer could use a seemingly legitimate number to try and trick people. By uncovering the origin of calls with Lookup, you won&apos;t waste your time on calling back people who don&apos;t have any real reason for contacting you. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.55%;"><img id="78SrehunX4Va6ddM9CzyS8" name="google-phone-app-hero-1.jpg" alt="Google Phone app logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78SrehunX4Va6ddM9CzyS8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1363" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lookup is going to have the most impact for people who aren&apos;t as savvy at detecting potential scams. For seasoned tech users, the Lookup tool will simplify the process of reverse searching a number, but it doesn&apos;t add any new functionality. However, it&apos;s going to be a game-changer for people who may not have even thought to Google Search the unknown number that called them. By putting the new Lookup button right in front of users, more people are going to use it in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-found-showing-whatsapp-call-log">Google Phone app</a>. </p><p>Aside from simply averting scams, Lookup is going to save users time. As we mentioned earlier, phone scams are becoming more advanced. A scammer posing as a police or court officer could have a thorough script and correct information, making it difficult to identify whether it&apos;s a scam or a serious problem. When it becomes clear that the call is a scam — the bad actors usually ask people to make payment through sketchy means — you may have already wasted a half hour believing it was real. </p><p>Using the Lookup tool might have revealed that the call wasn&apos;t coming from a real office before someone even called back. It&apos;s not only going to save people time, but also their money and identity from theft. Any time tech companies can make it easier for us to avoid online scams, it&apos;s appreciated, and that&apos;s exactly what this new feature does. </p>

According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-moto-razr-50-lineup-debuts-in-july/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a>, there&apos;s a follow-up event planned for July to reveal the Razr 2024 and Razr Plus 2024 for the global market.</p><p>Interestingly, Motorola&apos;s Weibo announcement about the event doesn&apos;t explicitly make mention of the Razr 50 and Razr 50 Ultra models. However, it&apos;s likely these are the smartphones the company is hinting at.</p><p>This year&apos;s models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-series-renders-reveal-cover-screen-changes">rumored to feature even larger, eye-catching front screens</a> for both the standard and premium versions.</p><p>As per earlier rumors, the top-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> is rumored to sport a big 4-inch cover display and a dual 50MP camera system. Meanwhile, the standard variant might come with a slightly smaller 3.6-inch cover screen to keep the price more competitive. You can also expect the standard model to feature a 120Hz main display and a lower megapixel front camera compared to its bigger sibling.</p><p>Based on previous reports, the Razr Plus 2024 is shaping up to be quite impressive. Rumor has it that it&apos;ll feature a massive 6.9-inch pOLED internal display with a 2640 x 1080 resolution and a silky-smooth 165Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Under the hood, the Razr 2024 series is gearing up for a performance showdown. The bigger variant is expected to be a powerhouse with Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chip, while the Razr 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">might go for the efficient MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a>.</p><p>The battle heats up on the charging front. The Razr Plus 2024 is rumored to feature blazing-fast 68W wireless charging, possibly making it the quickest folding phone to juice up in a short period of time. On the other hand, the Razr 2024 offers a solid 33W fast charging and a 4,200mAh battery.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube detailed a few new features it has available in testing for a small cluster of viewers and creators, such as AI live chat summaries in live streams.</li><li>Only available for English-speaking channels with "active chats," viewers will see a summary based on conversations before they joined.</li><li>Other tests include QR codes for better channel discovery and Google Lens integration with YouTube's search bar.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Moving into the weekend, YouTube is highlighting a few new features it currently has in testing for a limited percentage of viewers and creators.</p><p>As detailed in its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167/youtube-test-features-and-experiments">Features and Experiments</a>" post, YouTube states it has kickstarted a test for AI-generated live chat summaries. The platform explains that its AI software will create its summaries based on "published chats" in a live stream&apos;s rolling feed.</p><p>Viewers can see a snapshot of the most "exciting" conversations to understand them quicker without scrolling a bunch. YouTube adds that a live stream&apos;s chat must have a "sufficient" amount of chat data before the AI can kick in and begin summarizing.</p><p>This feature is rolling out to a small cluster of viewers who join eligible streams broadcast in English with "super active" chats.</p><p>We&apos;ve spotted YouTube&apos;s AI-generated chat summaries during a live stream. The summary appears when first entering the channel at the top of the feed. The text box offers an overview of what&apos;s transpired but quickly disappears after a few seconds. Minimizing the chat and re-opening it (or refreshing) produces it again, but with a new summary as the chat continues to evolve.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:411px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.80%;"><img id="Ukpu6Ht7Ww4uAQCMiaqHre" name="youtube-ai-generated-chat-summaries.jpg" alt="An example of YouTube's AI live chat summaries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ukpu6Ht7Ww4uAQCMiaqHre.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="411" height="254" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nickolas Diaz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The platform&apos;s next test involves a new way for users to discover channels through QR codes. YouTube states this is only available through its mobile app, informing creators in the test to navigate to the "You" tab. A new "Share your channel" chip will be displayed beneath your handle, which produces an interactable QR code.</p><p>The post states that users can share these codes anywhere and that online and offline users can scan them. Only a small group of creators will receive this test. However, YouTube states that it will detail an expansion if all goes well.</p><p>Lastly, YouTube is experimenting with integrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-lens-search-images-text-simultaneously">Google Lens</a> into its search bar. The function works similarly to Lens in other apps, as users can capture what they see with their phone&apos;s camera and run a search through YouTube&apos;s database. The post adds that users can learn more about what they see by tapping "Search on Google."</p><p>Those in the test will notice a Lens icon in the YouTube search bar. Note: only a small percentage of Android-based users are eligible.</p><p>Team YouTube highlighted a new test that involves creators and viewers the other day. The former will see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-details-test-compare-thumbnail-experiment">alternating thumbnails</a>. The company sees the test as a way for creators to gauge what type of photos entice viewers to click on their content. As such, they can upload up to three thumbnails, which will be shown to audiences "evenly" with feedback about which performed the best.</p><p>The service also started an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-highlights-premium-features-coversational-ai">AI test for Premium users</a> late last year, involving AI-powered summaries for comments and "Ask" for video-specific questions.</p>

<ul><li>Motorola's new, next-gen Bluetooth tracker has appeared for certification bearing model number "XT2445-1."</li><li>The tracker will supposedly appear as the "Moto Tag" once it hits the market, however, more concrete information was unavailable.</li><li>Google confirmed that Motorola would join its Find My Device with its own Bluetooth tracker alongside Eufy and Jio.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A discovery shows that Motorola&apos;s plans to re-enter the Bluetooth tracker game with a next-generation device are progressing.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/accessories/accessories-news/moto-tag-tdra-certification/">MySmartPrice</a> discovered a new UAE TDRA database listing, which details Motorola&apos;s device tracker in development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/14/motorola-find-my-device-moto-tag/">9to5Google</a>). The tracker reportedly appeared for certification as its listing shows its official market name: the "Moto Tag."</p><p>More information shows that the product falls within the "short-range device/low-power device" category. The publication notes that the Moto Tag bears the model number "XT2445-1."</p><p>Unfortunately, there was nothing more to unearth about the Moto Tag as the company hadn&apos;t provided any specifications. Photos of the devices or at least early renderings were also unavailable in the website&apos;s certification listings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:956px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.76%;"><img id="9BL2WYs9qQXeeC2icavPXP" name="motorola-moto-tag-certification-listing.jpg" alt="The database listing for the Motorola "Moto Tag."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9BL2WYs9qQXeeC2icavPXP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="956" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MySmartPrice)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola debuted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Smart-Tag-Finder-Anything/dp/B071FR7Y3P">"smart tracker"</a> in 2017, which was a circular device with a small space at the top to clip onto keys and other items. The device featured a slim, horizontal green light at the bottom, to showcase its activation. With the certification listing void of a design teaser, it remains to be seen if Motorola will continue with that old look or revamp it.</p><p>However, the existence of a Motorola brand tracker isn&apos;t coming out of leftfield as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">Google confirmed it would do so</a> in April. Joining the OEM is reportedly Eufy and Jio who will enter the network with brand new trackers.</p><p>A highlight of Google&apos;s new network is the addition of stronger user security and privacy measures to protect their devices.</p><p>Even more, users have been using Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">Find My Device network</a> since May. Folks can find their lost phones or accessories (e.g., earbuds) and even share the location of their devices with friends and family. There was also a discovery earlier in June that detailed Google&apos;s early development of AR-based directions for phones and UWB support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ar-directions-uwb-find-my-device">even more trackable devices</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing has announced a new staggered firmware rollout to its flagship Phone 2 this week, which includes new features in addition to improvements and bug fixes.</p><p>The update, dubbed <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.6</strong>,  comes right after the OS 2.5.5 released in April, bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-chatgpt-integration-camera-update">ChatGPT integration</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>. It also added conversation functionality to the recent Ear and "Ear a" buds. The latest firmware, however, brings in nifty new features, like a new option in Settings that lets users hide or show the navigation bar.</p>

<p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/11514-phone-2-nothing-os-256-changelog">community post</a>, Nothing explains features, like adding a custom option that lets users enable or disable the swipe action required to access the Quick Settings pane from the top of the lock screen. Additionally, Status bar icons can now be customized with new options that can be accessed via display settings on the Phone 2. Google&apos;s latest June security patch is the other notable thing added with the new update.</p><p>While the complete changelog can be viewed from the aforementioned community post, here are the primary improvements included with the OS 2.5.6:</p>
<ul><li>New Quick Settings Widget animations for enhanced engagement.</li><li>Optimized compatibility with some carrier networks.</li><li>Enhanced UI of carrier names.</li></ul>
<p>The latest firmware release refines the ChatGPT integration from the previous update to Phone 2, which will likely improve the AI service&apos;s overall experience. The new update also fixes an issue preventing cloned apps from functioning while on a VPN network. </p><p>The other fixed issues include lock screen widgets not showing up occasionally and back gestures that sometimes lacked haptic feedback. Lastly, the overall stability improvements will be seen with the OS 2.5.6 release on the Phone 2.</p><p>While the Phone 2 getting regular updates is a welcome move from Nothing, its CEO Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">has stated</a> that its successor, Phone 3, isn&apos;t coming this year, breaking the company&apos;s annual flagship release schedule. The CEO further mentioned that Nothing&apos;s been "designing and prototyping AI interactions," which are likely to be improved and witnessed on the Phone 3, which now has a launch pushed to next year.</p><p>"It&apos;s important we get the product right, integrating hardware and AI in a way that is both useful and brings a smile to people&apos;s faces," Pei added in his recent X post. </p>
