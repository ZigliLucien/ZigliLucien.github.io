<p>The Canadian government is opening the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/federal-government-launching-research-institute-for-ai-safety-1.7107410">Canadian Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute</a>, making it one of the first countries to do so after world leaders agreed at a summit in Seoul last May that a network of publicly funded safety institutes was needed to study and test AI. The center will cost "only" 50 million CAD over five years, with funding to come from the 2.4 billion earmarked for AI funding in the current federal budget.</p><p>I'm in firm agreement that this is a necessity and well worth the cost. Governments often spend too much money and bog down good ideas in red tape and bureaucracy, but the alternative of allowing the likes of Google and OpenAI to determine what's best will only lead to more profits, not what's best for the public at large. Something must be done because AI is worth doing right and can bring about more improvements than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">smartphone gimmicks</a>.</p>
<p>Canada's Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne says it succinctly:</p><p><em>"If you want people to adopt it, they need to have trust. If there's no adoption, we will squander the incredible potential of many new technologies."</em></p>
<p>This is an idea the United States — and most other countries with enough resources — needs to clone. I'd suggest going a step further and adding a cabinet position for a true Czar of AI and Future Technologies, but everything starts with small steps. AI is not going away, and allowing the tech to explode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-fight-against-ai-scammers-why-it-matters" target="_blank">without proper guidelines</a> and, dare I say, laws that govern its use is a dangerous and stupid idea.</p><p>There are countless small or individual state-funded groups that study AI and its "proper" use cases, but a centralized department that oversees and coordinates costly studies and research would be beneficial. Simply put, a country that does not take this technology seriously will play second fiddle to the countries that do.</p>
<p>With a new presidential administration, changes to what we are currently doing — not much aside from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">a Biden Executive Order</a> — are coming. President-elect Trump hasn't expressed much interest in any AI governance aside from abolishing said E.O. but there is a very good chance that we will see something that looks into the future and "proper" use of AI thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-senate-thune-cornyn-scott.html">incoming Senate Majority</a> Leader John Thune.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.13%;"><img id="8Y7nqcC8NC2AAzSCUweVaC" name="us-capitol-bldg.jpg" alt="Us Capitol Bldg" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Y7nqcC8NC2AAzSCUweVaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="505" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: US Park Service)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thune is, by all accounts, a conservative with very right-leaning views when it comes to regulations. However, the senior senator from South Dakota is familiar with the pros and cons of AI legislation from his time on the Commerce Committee and is not afraid to oppose Trump's agenda. He even cosponsored the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3312/text"><em>Artificial Intelligence Research, Innovation, and Accountability Act</em></a><em> </em>with Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) to promote more transparency and risk assessment of AI's use. He sounds like he understands that AI can't be set free or that having the technology overseen by the same companies building it is a bad idea.</p>
<p>This is also a case where the right's obsession with China can be beneficial. China can — and will — go all-in with AI to stave off a looming economic collapse if it thinks it can help. And it certainly can. AI can be a boon to manufacturing, agriculture, the energy sector, and, of course, defense when used properly. U.S. lawmakers have a responsibility to not allow any country, especially one that is the main global competitor in almost every way, to gain an advantage because the U.S. simply didn't try to compete. When that country is China, lawmakers will see it as a badge of courage or some other nonsense to do their job. As AI-focused bills "to fight China" are introduced, Thune will make sure they get their fair share of time in front of the Senate.</p><p>Canada may be looking at AI with increased scrutiny because it's best for Canadians. The U.S. would also do it because it somehow fights "the Chinese Communist Regime." I'm OK with that in this case, and you should be, too.</p>
<p>Expect to see other countries open similar state-sponsored AI study centers in 2025 as well as smaller international institutes doing their own research. As mentioned, world leaders agree it's necessary. Normally, with an incoming U.S. administration that is focused on maximizing corporate profit at any expense I'd not add the USA to that list, but a few details and circumstances make me optimistic.</p><p>If we don't find a way to regulate AI, it will forever remain a mixture of parlor tricks for your phone or a way for someone to scam you out of your money while the rest of the world flourishes.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've written quite a bit about the Pixel Tablet and what it could mean for the future of Google's Nest ecosystem. It's just something so obvious that it's almost comical to see Google contend it's not a Nest Hub replacement. Especially considering that the Pixel Tablet 2 is still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Tin-foil hat time. Maybe the Pixel Tablet is<em> actually</em> a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">Nest Hub replacement</a>, but Google wanted to put it into the wild disguised as a tablet with a detachable speaker dock. I mean, it makes perfect sense when you consider that the Speaker Dock is useless if the tablet isn't docked.</p><p>Then, there's the whole "Where's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a>" thing, which still has me scratching my head, given that Google released SO MANY devices this summer. The only things missing were new Nest speakers and an updated tablet. Everything else got revamped in one way or another.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FcJ45yEJ5Fu6xYopeJU4jn" name="tshaka_hub max v pixel tab.jpg" alt="nest hub max vs pixel tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FcJ45yEJ5Fu6xYopeJU4jn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wasn't until a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2-accessory-prototype-rumors">report</a> from Mishaal Rahman over at Android Authority helped the light bulb go off. Supposedly, Google is "working on" its next tablet, which "might" include a keyboard case. Where have I heard this before? Oh right. Google was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-relaunch-accessories-rumored">rumored to release</a> a keyboard case for the current Pixel Tablet, but I assume those days are long gone.</p><p>Google didn't <em>want</em> the Pixel Tablet to be a productivity tool, even with the display supporting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">USI 2.0 standard</a>. It's a nicety, but not a necessity, and definitely not something I suspect many people actually make use of. It would also help explain why the Pixel Tablet has such a boring and muted design, to go along with the LCD panel sporting those <em>thicc</em> bezels.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-this-work-2">How would this work?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So here's what I think <em>could</em> happen. The Pixel Tablet 2 is announced, complete with all (or at least many) of the bells and whistles for us productivity nerds out there. That means an upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, keyboard case, USI stylus, and perhaps even an OLED display with a faster refresh rate.</p><p>After that, Google debuts its revamped Nest speaker and display lineup, complete with a brand new Nest Hub Max. But it's not actually a new Nest Hub Max. It's just a rebranded Pixel Tablet, detachable screen and all!</p><p>But what about the regular Nest Hub?</p><p>Well, what device has a smaller display than the Nest Hub Max and Pixel Tablet but is bigger than a slab phone? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>! Of course, this imaginary Nest Hub wouldn't have a screen that folds in half, but it is more compact than the current generation while also looking quite a bit more modern.</p><p>I'm not exactly sure which of these would come first. But that's for Google to figure out.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-era-for-google-maybe-2">A new era for Google, maybe</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oCnTTS3eWJdJdcgbjv6mr9" name="google-tv-streamer-pixel-9-pro-pixel-watch-3-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Pixel Watch 3, Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCnTTS3eWJdJdcgbjv6mr9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If things play out the way I described, then after the dust settles, the Pixel Tablet 2 drops the deuce and is just the "Pixel Tablet" or even "Pixel Tablet (2nd Generation)." Kind of like how Apple's iPad Pro is not actually "iPad Pro 6 12.9" but is "iPad Pro 12.9 (6th Generation)."</p><p>The "New" Pixel Tablet (2nd Generation) gives Google a competitor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, and iPad. The revamped Nest Hub manages to get everyone excited about using Gemini in the home, especially when paired with the new Nest Thermostat and Google TV Streamer.</p><p>I don't even think this scenario is too far-fetched, but until Google makes its next move, I'm just going to continue wondering what in the world it has planned. Or maybe these are just the ramblings of a sleep-deprived tech nerd who attempts to think outside of the box. It's probably the latter.</p>

<ul><li>Google is adding Imagen 3 support to Google Docs for paid Gemini in Workspace users.</li><li>The feature will allow users to generate custom inline images that can be used anywhere in their Google Doc — without leaving the site.</li><li>Google Docs previously supported generating full-bleed cover images, but not inline images.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is leveraging its latest image generation model, Imagen 3, to bring custom images to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-new-feature-is-your-go-to-tool-for-wrangling-those-giant-documents">Google Docs</a>, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/use-gemini-in-google-docs-to-create-images.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> today. The company calls these images "photorealistic," and they could be a replacement for stock images in some situations. However, in order to create your own images with Imagen 3 in Google Docs, you'll need to be a paid Workspace user or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> subscriber.</p><p>Before the rollout of Imagen 3 in Docs, Google was already experimenting with image generation in Workspace. It first added support for generating full-bleed cover images in Google Docs and image generation in Google Slides. Now, there's support in Google Docs for unabridged inline image generation. A quick prompt is all it takes to create a cover or in-text image, as you can see in the example from Google below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.25%;"><img id="LLEdv4aSVGMqqL9frJ29JZ" name="gemini-createacoverimage" alt="The new image generation capabilities in Google Workspace." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLEdv4aSVGMqqL9frJ29JZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="747" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">Imagen 3</a> in Google Docs, navigate to the <strong>Insert </strong>menu and click <strong>Image</strong> or <strong>Cover image</strong>. Then, select <strong>Help me create an image</strong>. From there, you can use a text prompt to help Imagen 3 create the image you're looking for, and manually choose a style to further refine your prompt. After your image is created, you can pick from three aspect ratios to find the one that best suits your document.</p><p>For now, cover images are only supported when viewing Google Docs in what the company calls "pageless mode." This makes the custom AI-generated image cover the entire document. To activate it, navigate to <strong>File > Page setup > Pageless or Format > Switch to Pageless format</strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately, text-to-image generation in Google Docs isn't available for free users. Users of Gemini Business, Gemini Enterprise, Gemini Education, or Gemini Education Premium will be able to use it. Additionally, individual Workspace users subscribed to Google One AI Premium have access. It's rolling out now, but can take some time to show up for all users, especially if your school or work uses a scheduled release timeline.</p>

However, Samsung did update this in the Watch 7, giving it the coveted dual-band GPS hardware for peak accuracy, and it also upgraded multiple other sensors in the 2024 release.</p>

<p>Samsung’s next batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> is anticipated to launch early next year. However, new information from multiple sources confirms that the Korean tech giant might aim for a later January launch date.</p><p>Firstly, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fnnews.com/ampNews/202411141109523375">Korean media outlet</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-may-descend-on-this-january-day-without-4th-variant/">SamMobile</a>) has noted that the Unpacked event will be held on January 23, 2025—not similar to what we saw in the Galaxy S24 series launch, which was on January 17.</p>

<p>The upcoming Unpacked event is believed to be held in San Francisco, U.S. However, another reliable tipster, Max Jambor on X, noted that it might be on January 22, 2025 — a day earlier than the aforementioned predicted date.</p><p>Regardless of both the hinted dates, the launch date of the Galaxy S25 series isn’t drastically different from the predecessor models. Previous rumors of an early launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung flagships</a> didn’t turn out to be accurate. However, there could still be a possibility of shuffling these launch dates as we approach them in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>As the publication notes, Samsung launched the Galaxy S23 series in San Francisco in 2023, and the successors were introduced in San Jose. It is likely that the company will bring the next flagship phones to San Francisco again, alongside its home ground.</p><p>As we near the anticipated launch, we expect the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra to be unveiled at the Unpacked event. Earlier reports have also hinted that a new Galaxy S25 Slim might also be in the works. This device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-slim-galaxy-s25-might-be-samsungs-answer-to-apples-rumored-thin-iphone-17">is expected</a> to debut in the second quarter of 2025 and not alongside the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the Galaxy S25 Slim is believed to be a thinner variant of the flagship lineup to take on Apple’s rumored iPhone 17 “Air,” which is also slated to launch next year. The rumor mill also hints that the expected Galaxy S25 Slim could be some kind of a pilot program from Samsung, which will have a test run next year. If it all goes well, users can expect the successor for the masses, likely with the Galaxy S26 series the following year.</p>

<ul><li>Users have taken to Reddit to report an apparent stable, server-side rollout of dual SIM support for RCS chats in Google Messages.</li><li>Reports claim support has arrived for varying carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T, Visible, and more, though not everyone has seen it yet.</li><li>Google was first spotted moving such support into beta earlier this year, letting users quickly swap connections between SIM cards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A wave of reports claim that Google's dual SIM support for RCS chats in the Messages app is starting to roll out.</p><p>Users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gedpvv/dual_rcs_support_enabled/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">taken to Reddit</a> to report that Google Messages has started pushing its dual SIM for RCS support to stable users/versions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/dual-sim-rcs-starts-appearing-for-some-in-us/">Android Police</a>). One user in the U.S. states that they've started noticing support appear within the app's RCS settings. Another user confirmed as much, stating no notification was given about its arrival in the app.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gqs4si/just_got_dual_sim_rcs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">separate thread</a> in the app's subreddit states a user received dual SIM support on a Pixel 9 Pro XL. The user states they are in the U.S. and have U.S. Mobile and Visible. However, some users are having a more troubling experience with the app's dual SIM RCS support. One user in the Google Messages beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gedpvv/comment/lujud3i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">hasn't yet received the feature</a>, stating they have two SIMs from Verizon.</p><p>Another report confirmed additional issues, which could point to an ongoing rollout on Google's side. Users claim that clearing data and Play Services has done nothing to produce the feature. So, it's probably best if users wait for Google to flip the switch.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gedpvv/dual_rcs_support_enabled">Dual RCS support enabled!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Elsewhere, the publication states that users have noticed the dual SIM support for RCS chats appear in v20241018_01_RC00 of the beta. The post adds that reports from other users say they've received proper support with SIMs from T-Mobile, AT&T, and Google Fi in conjunction with those previously mentioned.</p><p>Google was first tipped to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-support-for-dual-sim-rcs">dual SIM support for RCS-enabled chats</a> early this year. Similar to how users see it today, the app will display two checkboxes within its RCS settings. Each box will showcase the name of the SIM card's cellular network and its current status. Naturally, for RCS, the app will need to run through its verification steps. Once you're good and green, users can easily toggle their SIM card connection.</p><p>Google seemingly teased this in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/7189714">support document</a>, stating, "RCS chats are available for your default or preferred call SIM at this time and may be available for other SIMs later." However, with the rollout appearing fragmented, it's still taking time.</p><p>A more recent Google Messages beta showed the company might shift its UI elements — specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-read-receipts-placement-redesign-spotted">its read receipts</a>. Users might soon find them implemented alongside a user's text, instead of directly beneath.</p>

Join the Verizon-owned wireless carrier before December 2nd and type in the <strong>code SAVE24</strong> during checkout and you&apos;ll be guaranteed to receive two years of coverage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><strong>as little as $20 per month for the base plan or $35 per month for Visible Plus</strong></a>. Only new members are eligible for the deal, but that&apos;s basically where the fine print ends.  </p>

The deal knocks $5 off the base plan every month while Visible Plus users will get $10 shaved off their phone bill every month for 24 months. That may not seem like a lot, but considering that it's a no-hassle discount on one of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a>, it's certainly deserving of your attention.  </p>

<ul><li>Scam Detection, the AI-based Google Phone app feature first previewed at Google I/O, is finally rolling out to beta testers.</li><li>After announcing the rollout earlier this week, Phone by Google beta app users noticed a new Scam Detection toggle in the app's settings menu today.</li><li>Scam Detection automatically runs in the background, scanning unknown calls that have the potential to be scams with AI.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-nano-detect-suspected-scams">best features previewed at Google I/O</a> is finally rolling out to beta testers today, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1857445901364810069" target="_blank">Artem Russakovskii on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. Google previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-now-use-ai-to-detect-scam-calls-in-real-time" target="_blank">announced</a> that it planned to start rolling out Scam Detection to users enrolled in the Google Phone app beta, and now the feature is officially reaching beta testers. To try the feature for yourself, you must be in the U.S., enrolled in the Phone by Google beta, and using a Pixel 6 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">newer smartphone</a>.</p><p>Scam Detection is available as a toggle in the Google Phone app settings, and is identified with a "beta" badge. After flipping on the toggle, Scam Detection will run in the background using on-device AI, notifying you if there is a potential scam happening in your phone call — all in real time.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scam Detection went silently live for me in the Google Phone app on the Pixel 9 Pro XL.

I had to check the settings to manually turn it on. pic.twitter.com/JJsC2a9upQ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1857445901364810069">November 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For privacy reasons, Scam Detection is disabled by default, even for those enrolled in the Google Phone app beta. If you want to try it out, you'll need to manually flip the toggle on yourself by going to <strong>Phone app settings </strong>and <strong>Assistive</strong>, then selecting <strong>Scam Detection</strong>. Additionally, Scam Detection can be turned off at any time, or in the middle of a specific call. When Scam Detection is active for a particular call, a beeping tone will play periodically to signal that the call is being anaylzed.</p><p>Owners of the new Google Pixel 9 series will get Gemini Nano as the on-device AI model screening calls for potential scams. However, the rest of the supported devices are vaguely said to use "other Google machine learning models."</p><p>The new Scam Detection page in the Phone by Google beta app settings explains more about how the feature works. It won't ever screen calls with people saved in your contacts. Call content is never saved or recorded, according to Google. The screening will only take place when calling unknown numbers in calls "that have the potential to be scams."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="CxXrDt8FUYjzGqWxoSwySB" name="Google-scam-detection-feature" alt="Google scam detection flashing warning on the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CxXrDt8FUYjzGqWxoSwySB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="840" height="504" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If a potential scam is detected, a pop-up will appear explaining that the call is "likely scam" and there was "suspicious activity detected for this call." From there, users can press <strong>Not a scam</strong> if they trust the caller, or <strong>End call</strong> to immediately cut the call off.</p><p>Google is looking for beta testers to share feedback about their experience with Scam Detection, and the company plans to share more about the feature in the coming months following this beta rollout.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted developing a new feature through Play Services called "Shielded Email."</li><li>The feature will supposedly let users create a "fake," "generated" email for apps that may require one to avoid potential online risks.</li><li>Google stepped up its fight against spam/phishing attempts by rolling out verified marks in Gmail and bolstering it with a new spam detector.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly developing an email protection feature that echoes what Apple's done for iOS.</p><p>Well-known X tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-shielded-email-3499803/">Android Authority</a>) dove into the latest Play Services build (v24.45.33) and found support for a new feature. Strings in the code suggest Google is working on a "generated email address" tool under the "Shield Email" moniker.</p><p>Other strings give us an idea of how this might work as one claims users can generate an email "created for this app." The company's early description reads, "this can protect you from online tracking and data breaches."</p><p>Another set of strings highlights "email forwarding." This generated guise will seemingly let users forward emails it receives to their true address. There is space in the code for users to enter their <em>actual </em>email when the time comes. Moreover, Google is working on an option that lets users opt out if things turn to spam.</p><p>Additional descriptors show that Google intends this feature to keep users' emails private. The publication states these generated emails will be "single-use" or "limited-use aliases." The recent Play Services build notably lacks where Google could implement this feature.</p><p>The post states that further digging through the APK suggests Google plans to work Shielded Email directly into apps that may ask for your email.</p><p>Despite its rollout uncertainty, the feature has reportedly appeared on the Autofill settings page. However, the tipster notes that tapping it doesn't offer much as it's still under development, but this could indicate a debut that's sooner, not later.</p><p>Google has consistently stepped up its game to combat spam as Gmail picked up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-improves-gmail-spam-detection">new spam detector</a>. The company implemented a new text vectorizer called "RETVec." Research showed that it enhanced the app's spam detection by roughly 38% and reduced false positives by ~20%. In short, RETVec would scan an incoming email with sharp eyes on the symbols used to weed out would-be spam.</p><p>Similarly, Gmail received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-gets-blue-verification-checkmarks-to-prevent-phishing">blue verification checkmarks</a>, a part of the BIMI authentication system. The purpose of the marks is to give users quick, forward-facing confirmation of an email's legitimacy. If a sender is who they say they are, they will display a blue checkmark beside their logo/name. Of course, this applies to official businesses to help users dodge dangerous phishing attempts.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the Pixel 9 series in our hands, all eyes turn to Google's next tablet (potentially) in 2025.</p><p>The latest rumors stem from Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-tablet-2-keyboard-3500081/">Android Authority</a>) and an unknown "Google source" who spoke about the Pixel Tablet 2's supposed design. The insider claims the tablet's "early prototypes" feature a design quite close to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">the original device</a> from 2023. However, certain physical aspects like its camera have been shifted to the left alongside its power button.</p><p>Rumors suggest its display bezels could shrink, but this is seemingly restricted to the "top and bottom." The camera is reportedly receiving an upgrade, though it's unclear if this applies to the front <em>and </em>back.</p><p>Another rumor claims the Pixel Tablet 2 is being developed with a "keyboard cover" accessory. The keyboard allegedly attaches to the pogo pins on the tablet's back panel. Moreover, since rumors point toward it doubling as a "cover," speculation states it can "prop up" the tablet during use.</p><p>This accessory is supposedly in a prototyping stage so, hopefully, it arrives.</p><p>The post ends with speculation on the 2nd-gen Pixel Tablet, stating it could feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> SoC. Similarly, speculation claims it's a toss-up between Android 15 and 16 for its launch.</p>

<p>We've been through this song and dance with the Pixel Tablet's <em>supposed </em>accessories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-more-accessories-rumor">since last year</a>. Early rumors claimed Google had two more planned: a keyboard and a stylus. Neither of them saw the light of day. Those rumors surged when its re-release of the Pixel Tablet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-relaunch-accessories-rumored">was just a theory</a>, but nothing happened (again).</p><p>At the time, it was initially rumored that the accessories hadn't arrived because they "weren't ready." It seems Google had striking quality concerns with its in-house accessories. Rumors didn't expand on a potential stylus, so we're still in the dark.</p><p>In February, Google's Android 14 beta featured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/rumored-pixel-tablet-2-codenames">two codenames</a>: "Clementine" and "Kiyomi." Both names were rumored to reference the Pixel Tablet 2 as the company has a history of using citrus-based fruits for its tablet. Speculation said Google could have a "Pixel Tablet Pro" in the works and potentially an OLED display upgrade over the O.G's LCD.</p>
