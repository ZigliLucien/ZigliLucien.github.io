<ul><li>YouTube confirms that it has started rolling out multiview on iOS devices, leaving Android users waiting for the "coming months."</li><li>The YouTube TV app's version of multiview is quite basic, only providing a set of pre-determined options instead of letting users customize it.</li><li>YouTube TV picked up "Custom Multiviews" on TVs in February, just in time for March Madness as it supports NCAA basketball games and the NBA League Pass.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users have started noticing multiview appear on YouTube TV&apos;s iOS app, leaving Android users twiddling their thumbs.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/20/youtube-tv-multiview-iphone-ipad-android/">9to5Google</a>, YouTube has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1aw8383/comment/kvlcqav/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">confirmed</a> on Reddit that multiview is rolling out now (Mar. 20) via version 8.11 of its TV app. Thus far, the feature has only been spotted on Apple&apos;s iPhone and iPad. It appears that multiview is accessed via the "Home" tab and only works with a few "select" games.</p><p>A user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1bgcq46/comment/kv6bi8o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> stated that multiview&apos;s rollout on mobile comes without its custom builder. Those who&apos;ve received the update can only choose between a few pre-determined four-game selections. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1bftqyc/multiview_on_iphone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">post on Reddit</a> showcased what multiview looks like on an iPhone, giving users a clear look at what to expect when it comes to Android.</p><p>Curiously, a user commented stating they&apos;ve received a pop-up in the YouTube TV app on Android detailing mulitview&apos;s arrival. Further digging showed it&apos;s not there, and we likely shouldn&apos;t expect it for a while.</p><p>A member of the YouTube TV team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1aw8383/comment/kvlcvos/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">stated</a> "we&apos;ll be launching multiview on Android in the coming months."</p>

<p>YouTube TV&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-build-a-multiview-spotted">build a multiview</a>" was first spotted in a limited fashion at the end of January for smart TVs. The feature has since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/custom-multiviews-in-youtube-tv-let-you-pick-four-basketball-games-to-watch-at-once">officially rolled out</a>, just in time for March Madness. Users will find initial support for the NBA League Pass and NCAA basketball games. However, the feature is still quite limited, as users can only choose games belonging to a singular genre.</p><p>If you&apos;re watching the NBA, you&apos;ll only find NBA games to customize your multiview. It&apos;s disappointing that multiview&apos;s arrival on mobile lacks this customization, but there&apos;s always a chance it will arrive in the future.</p><p>Other YouTube TV news involves the app picking up a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-gets-new-last-channel-shortcut"> "last channel" </a>shortcut for easier channel switching. To utilize the new switcher, users will need to long-press the "select" or "OK" buttons on their remote. The app&apos;s shortcut is said to work with Live TV, videos on demand, and DVR content.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's mobile chief, TM Roh, discussed the company's review of whether or not it could bring full Galaxy AI support to the S22 series.</li><li>Roh stated there is little difference between the S22 and the S23 FE, which is eligible for Galaxy AI, so the company is preparing to investigate further.</li><li>Roh also mentioned the company's interest in a rollable Android phone, stating the company is looking into how consumers could use it and its place on the market.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new development from Samsung&apos;s mobile division chief could signal a change in its Galaxy AI approach for a past-gen series.</p><p>According to a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/003/0012438768?sid=105">Naver</a>, Samsung&apos;s mobile division chief TM Roh spoke about potentially bringing Galaxy AI support to the Galaxy S22 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ai-galaxy-s22-series-3427208/">Android Authority</a>). Roh added, during the company&apos;s 55th annual general shareholders meeting, that it is "reviewing" whether or not such AI features could be applied to the two-year-old series.</p><p>Galaxy AI relies heavily on a device&apos;s hardware capabilities as Samsung reportedly aims for "hybrid AI" that blends on-device and cloud-based features. However, Roh stated that the capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> aren&apos;t vastly different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, which is eligible for the AI update.</p><p>Roh mentioned that Samsung is "gradually preparing" plans to bring full Galaxy AI support to the S22 series. Despite that, there are other "limitations" to take into account before proceeding. So, there&apos;s a chance that the makeup of the S22 series proves too difficult.</p><p>During the meeting, Roh discussed the company&apos;s apparent interest in a rollable Android phone. He stated, "we are currently steadily pursuing these procedures." Consumers and a rollable phone&apos;s place on the market is another object of discussion Samsung is currently reviewing internally.</p><p>Regarding the S22, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s22-not-getting-galaxy-ai">reported in January</a> that Samsung would skip the past-gen series. It was a curious decision, considering the S22 and the S23 FE utilize the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, meaning there was likely another aspect of the former that swayed Samsung&apos;s decision.</p><p>For now, owners of a Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, or S22 Ultra can expect the upcoming One UI 6.1 update.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung&apos;s interest in a rollable phone has been floating about for a while as the company showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">more concepts</a> during CES 2024. During the conference, folks were treated to a look at the Korean OEM&apos;s "In&Out Flip." The device could fold its display 360 degrees, meaning users could still utilize its main display even while "closed."</p><p>Another device, the Rollable Flex, was presented as a device that could unroll and become five times larger than its original form.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Wallet has been receiving new updates lately, and another one has been added to the mix: the ability to add the "pkpss" file format, which is the one that Apple Wallet uses.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> features the ability to import digital passes from the "pkpss" format. Rahman notes that he received a tip from a Telegram user (Cob) showcasing the addition of the downloaded "pkpss" file format on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Wallet may soon be able to import digital passes saved in Apple's .pkpass format!One user on Telegram tells me that Google Wallet is now able to import .pkpass files. This doesn't work for me yet, though. Let me know if this works for you!(Thanks to Cob on Telegram for… https://t.co/jjAL3o2mbA pic.twitter.com/O69NHNRs6L<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1768745883305173312">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As mentioned, the pkpss file format is usually seen in Apple Wallet; however, a pkpss format download can be added to Google Wallet through a few simple steps, per the video shared by Rahman on X. Accessing the file from the system and later agreeing to some terms and conditions, the user could easily add it to the Google Wallet app as a digital pass.</p><p>The support for this feature has been long overdue, as Google said it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1719411253171396859">incorporating this feature</a> back in 2022. However, Rahman spotted evidence of it being in the works last year. Regardless, the tip shared by Rahman on X indicates the feature is being rolled out to a few people. Some users who responded to Rahman&apos;s post have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1768749926761017384">acknowledged</a> the feature&apos;s availability on their devices in certain regions.</p>
<p>The criteria for the rollout to Android devices still need to be determined. Nonetheless, we expect it to roll out soon officially through an update to the Google Wallet app. With the soon-to-be-expected rollout, users can easily store tickets and digital IDs as well as import them even in the "pkpss" file format on their Google Wallet app. The new ability eliminates relying on third-party services to import the said file format.</p><p>The new feature comes after Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">recently gained</a> the ability to save movie tickets and boarding passes directly from Gmail. Users getting ticket confirmations from Gmail could see their tickets being added directly to the Google Wallet app. The same update has also included the ability to archive older passes.</p>

<p>Rumors swirl regarding Sony&apos;s upcoming Xperia 1 VI flagship device and a potential dip in quality.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1748136774/O57Zo0j9V">zackbuks</a> on Weibo, Sony may drop its 4K resolution display panel on the upcoming Xperia 1 VI (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fonearena.com/blog/419426/sony-xperia-1-vi-display-specs-leak.html">fonearena</a>). Rumors suggest the device could drop down to the "2K Plus" resolution panel that the Xperia 5 series notably sported. The publication mentions another rumor, which states the device could receive a "Quad HD Plus" display instead.</p><p>The post speculates Sony may opt to make the upcoming Android phone a little wider in 2024 instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">last year&apos;s</a> taller form factor.</p><p>The Weibo leaker states that this could be due to a change in aspect ratio. They purport that once it launches, the device may change from a 21:9 to a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Design-wise, the Xperia 1 VI isn&apos;t expected to change. The post claims Sony will look to keep the next-gen phone "similar" to its 2023 release. Its triple camera array is expected to remain, with other rumors stating it could contain three 48MP lenses.</p><p>Additional details about the device are unknown, however, there&apos;s speculation that it could launch in May.</p>

<p>The rumors end with speculation that Sony could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1748136774/O5kD2i5St">move away</a> from its Xperia 5 series altogether this year. The company launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-5-v-launch">Xperia 5 V</a> in September 2023, featuring its own downgrade through a dual-camera array. Despite the alteration, the device still packed the same camera sensor as its more expensive Xperia 1 V counterpart.</p><p>The alleged launch month for the Xperia 1 VI coincides with Sony&apos;s previous launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1 V</a>. The device debuted with a strong focus on its camera sensors for creators. The device&apos;s 4K display could reach a maximum 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the 1 V offered a 52MP-equivalent primary camera, a notable jump from the series&apos; old 12MP sensors.</p><p>Sony doesn&apos;t let users utilize the camera&apos;s entire strength, meaning they&apos;re only able to use 48MP of it. A 12MP ultrawide and a 12MP telephoto lens round out the array. More information about the upcoming Xperia 1 VI will likely surface as we move closer to its supposed launch.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Imagine a world where your phone understands your needs before you even say them, where your fitness tracker personalizes your workout routine in real-time, or where your smart home adjusts the temperature based on your mood. This future is closer than you think, thanks to the growing power of on-device AI processing.</p><p>But what exactly is on-device AI processing? In simpler terms, it means running artificial intelligence algorithms directly on a device, like your smartphone or smartwatch, instead of relying on remote servers in the cloud. This local processing unlocks a range of benefits that are transforming the way we interact with technology.</p>
<p>Many of the new AI features you hear so much about use on-device processing. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google Gemini</a> leverage specialty-built microprocessors and phone hardware to run features locally, though the exact requirements are still a little up in the air.</p><p>For example, Samsung offers the full suite of Galaxy AI features on the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> line, but Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">doesn&apos;t provide the same access to local processing</a> on the smaller Pixel 8 with less RAM. It&apos;s speculated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">12GB of memory is required</a> to process an LLM (large language model), but neither Samsung nor Google have confirmed.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-on-device-ai-matter-2">Why does on-device AI matter?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The shift towards on-device AI processing brings several key advantages:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Enhanced Privacy:</strong> By keeping user data on the device itself, on-device AI minimizes risk and ensures greater user control over personal information. This is especially important for sensitive data like facial recognition or health records.</li><li><strong>Faster Performance:</strong> Cloud-based AI relies on sending data back and forth between your device and a server. This communication can introduce latency, causing delays in response times. On-device AI eliminates this delay, leading to a smoother, more responsive user experience.</li><li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> Not everywhere has reliable internet access. On-device AI allows AI-powered features to work even when you're offline. Imagine using voice commands to control your smart home while camping, or translating languages on the go without needing a data connection.</li><li><strong>Improved Security:</strong> Since data processing happens locally, on-device AI reduces the attack surface for hackers. This is crucial for applications dealing with sensitive information, like financial transactions or medical diagnoses.</li><li><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Constantly transmitting data to the cloud can drain your battery. On-device AI processing reduces reliance on the cloud, leading to improved battery life on your devices.</li></ul>
<p>Because of these benefits, on-device AI is already making waves in various industries. On your phone, facial recognition for unlocking, voice assistants like Siri and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, and personalized camera filters are all powered by on-device AI.</p><p>On-device AI allows <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">smart speakers</a> to understand your voice commands more accurately and personalize your home environment based on your preferences and habits. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">Fitness trackers</a> can analyze your movement patterns and heart rate data in real-time to provide personalized coaching and activity recommendations.</p>
<p>Outside the general consumer market, on-device AI is also at play in ways you probably wouldn&apos;t consider. Self-driving cars rely heavily on on-device AI for real-time object recognition, pathfinding, and collision avoidance. In factories and assembly plants, on-device AI allows connected devices to make decisions locally, optimizing performance and reducing reliance on centralized servers.</p><p>If a "smart" computer can make a difference, doing it locally is preferred. It&apos;s faster, less dependent on "outside" forces like internet connectivity, and allows for easier corrections.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-on-device-ai-2">The future of on-device AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The potential of on-device AI processing is huge. As device processors become more powerful and AI models become smaller and more efficient, we can expect even more sophisticated applications to emerge.</p><p>Possibilities include better context-aware computing, where your phone anticipates your needs based on your location, time of day, and past behavior. It could automatically adjust settings, recommend apps, or provide relevant information without you even asking.</p>
<p>AI could analyze your preferences and habits across various applications, offering a truly personalized user experience that adapts to your evolving needs. It can also make security features more robust — AI could better look for anomalies during fingerprint detection or facial scanning. You wouldn&apos;t want features like these to work via the cloud.</p><p>On-device AI processing is still in its early stages, but it will play a major role in shaping the future of technology. By offering greater privacy, faster performance, and improved security, on-device AI paves the way for a more intelligent and user-centric future.</p>

Not only that, but if you want to document the event on your smartphone, you&apos;ll also need something to protect your device&apos;s camera lens. Fortunately, we found a pair of solar eclipse glasses that do both, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ44VN7J"><strong>they&apos;re only $7.64 during Amazon&apos;s Big Spring Sale</strong></a>. </p>

<p>If you plan on watching the historic solar eclipse on April 8th, don't forget to protect yourself with a pair of solar glasses. Currently 15% off during Amazon's Big Spring Sale, these disposable shades from Medical King can also be converted into a filter that protects your phone from damage if you want to film or photograph the event. Each pack comes with five glasses that you can share with friends and family, along with an informative guide book.</p>
<p>Despite claims from the manufacturer, it's worth noting that we haven't tested the effectiveness of these glasses as a filter for your phone camera. They've been certified to protect your eyes during the event, but it's hard to know how the pictures will turn out. Still, we'll be trying it once April 8th rolls around, and at only $8, it's a small investment. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ44VN7J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6d7978d8-c976-41c9-9810-43b3a71afea2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$8.99" data-dimension48="$8.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-spring-sale-2024-early-deals-predictions-and-what-to-expect"><strong>Amazon's Big Spring Sale is LIVE:</strong> these are the deals we'd buy</a></li></ul>
<p>For less than 10 bucks, you&apos;ll get five eclipse glasses that are designed to be cut and folded to fit around your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>&apos; camera lens. The frames are constructed from cardstock, so they aren&apos;t exactly suitable for repeated or long-term use, but the filtered lenses have been certified to meet standards set by the American Astronomical Society, so your eyes (and your devices) will be safe.</p><p>From a personal standpoint, I used eclipse glasses just like these during the 2017 eclipse, and I&apos;m not being hyperbolic when I say that they&apos;re worth every penny. If you live anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/news/live/solar-eclipse-live-updates">zone of totality</a> on April 8th, take the drive and go watch the event. You won&apos;t be sorry, and thanks to this Amazon deal, your bank account won&apos;t be either.</p>

<ul><li>Google Health has provided an update on Fitbit Labs at The Checkup 2024 event.</li><li>Fitbit Labs will use a Personal Health Large Language Model to help users understand their data better.</li><li>The feature is set to become available later this year to a limited number of Android users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitbit Labs was first teased to us at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> launch event in 2023. Now, we have a few more insights into what Fitbit Labs has to offer and who stands to benefit from it.</p><p>At the recent Google Health <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7-Bi6t-iYU">The Checkup</a> event (as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/fitbit-labs-personal-health-llm/">9to5 Google</a>), it was revealed that users who are eligible to try Fitbit Labs will be able to test a variety of AI features. Most notable is the introduction of an AI-powered chatbot that aims to give users the ability to better understand the data collected by their Fitbits by using a “freeform chat space.” </p>
<p>According to Florence Thng, Google Director of Product: “Our users want tools to help them connect the dots within their health data so that they can better understand their personal health metrics.” In turn, the hope is that this can be turned into actionable advice for users, “where you have access to an on-demand personal coach that can provide you with daily guidance.”</p><p>The chatbot itself is powered by a Personal Health Large Language Model that’s being developed by Google Research and Fitbit. The AI is a “fine-tuned version of our Gemini model…using high-quality research case studies." </p>

<p>Examples of how this could help users included analyzing variations in sleep patterns and quality before making recommendations on the intensity or timing of your next workout, as well as providing more tailored insights around metrics such as heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and exercise intensity. </p><p>Google confirmed that it will be sharing more research “soon,” which should allow users to better understand how the model is built and how accurate the results are likely to be.</p><p>It was also confirmed that Fitbit Labs features will be “available for testing for a limited number of Android users who are enrolled in the Fitbit Labs program in the mobile app.” At this stage, it&apos;s unclear exactly which eligible Android users will be given priority to test these new features. Fitbit Labs will be available to that select group of users “later this year.”</p>

<p>Head to Amazon during this week's Big Spring Sale and you'll get a straight $200 off the price of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, one of our favorite foldable phones ever made. For 800 bucks, you're getting an unlocked device with a sleek flip-phone design, two gorgeous AMOLED displays, and an efficient Snapdragon chip that handles most tasks with ease. Amazon is even offering up to $401 of trade-in credit (in the form of a gift card) when you send in an old or broken device.  <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C63KD7JP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5f1901fd-843c-41e4-b7f2-fdbb45b5506d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you enjoy using compact or flip-style foldable phones; you like buying your mobile devices unlocked; you take a lot of selfies. </p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait until the release of the Z Flip 6 (presumably this summer); you don&apos;t like using Samsung phones. </p><p>We once called the Z Flip 5 the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phone</a> for most users", namely due to its balance of innovation with a relatively accessible price tag. Its compact flip-phone construction means that the Z Flip 5 is far more affordable than the Galaxy Z Fold 5 or Pixel Fold, but you still get a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, a stunning new cover display, and a convenient, super-pocketable form factor. </p><p>Unless you&apos;re super committed to buying this Samsung foldable, there are a few things to consider before making your purchase. For one, keep in mind that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> will probably arrive some time this summer (likely late July or early August), so if you&apos;re willing to wait five or six months to buy your new phone, it could be worth it. </p><p>Additionally, the Z Flip 5 has a major competitor in the form of the Motorola Razr Plus (2023). The debate has been raging for months now, so it might be worth checking out our guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">Z Flip 5 vs Razr Plus</a> if you&apos;re still on the fence. After all, the Amazon Spring Sale is currently knocking the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2XF43BD"><strong>Motorola flip phone down to $699</strong></a>, a full $100 cheaper than its Samsung rival. You really can&apos;t go wrong either way, but ultimately, the choice is yours. </p>
