                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>ASUS pivoted to making small phones two years ago, and that strategy worked for the brand. At a time when other brands started focusing on bigger devices, the Zenfone series served as the de facto choice for those that wanted a small phone with high-end hardware. </p><p>But the brand still has a sizeable userbase that wants a large phone, and it&apos;s now catering to those users with the introduction of the Zenfone 11 Ultra — which has a 6.78-inch screen while retaining the best features of previous Zenfone devices.</p><p>What it doesn&apos;t have is any design similarity to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">Zenfone 9</a>; if anything, the phone looks nearly identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8</a>, and the USB-C port at the bottom isn&apos;t centered. Clearly, ASUS is using the same foundation for both phones, and I don&apos;t have a problem with that.</p><p>While ASUS hasn&apos;t confirmed the existence of a smaller Zenfone, the naming convention suggests we should see a standard Zenfone 11 model that&apos;s based on a smaller chassis — similar to the last two years. Considering the launch window of the Zenfone 11 Ultra, we should see the regular model debut sometime in the summer.</p><p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra shares the same great feature-set as its predecessors, but it has the same foibles: the phone will only get two platform updates, and that is nowhere close to being enough in 2024. However, there&apos;s a distinct lack of Android phones with clean software and good customizability, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra slots into that segment with effortless ease.</p><p>ASUS is also betting big on AI, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra has a slate of useful features that make a difference. I used the Zenfone 11 Ultra as my daily driver for two weeks, and here&apos;s what I think of the device.</p>

<p>ASUS unveiled the Zenfone 11 Ultra on March 14, and the phone is now up for pre-order in select global markets. The base model has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and ASUS is also rolling out a 16GB/512GB version.</p><p>The 12GB/256GB model will be available for $899 in the U.S., €999 in most European countries, and £869 in the U.K. ASUS isn&apos;t launching the 16GB/512GB model in the U.S. at the moment, but it will debut at €1,099 in Europe and £949 in the U.K.</p><p>ASUS has pre-order offers running from March 14 to April 14 that bring the cost of the 12GB/256GB model down to €899 in Europe and £819 in the U.K., and the 16GB/512GB to €999 and £869. ASUS will sell the device via its website as well as Amazon, and local partners in select regions.</p><p>ASUS isn&apos;t discounting the device in the U.S., but will bundle its Cetra earbuds with all pre-orders. The Zenfone 11 Ultra will be sold via ASUS&apos;s website in the U.S., and the brand&apos;s regional partner Mobile Advance will sell the device on Amazon.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-11-ultra-design"><span>ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="buN8YTwhvAzsCAjTC2hT3T" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-29.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/buN8YTwhvAzsCAjTC2hT3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS is switching things up with the Zenfone 11 Ultra, and the matte texture with oversized cameras that were a chief design characteristic of the last two years is making way for a cleaner look. The Zenfone 11 Ultra instead has a silky finish at the back, and the design is based on ASUS&apos;s anniversary logo monogram.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AisvLhuZpEv5AmBZEbsyrP" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-6.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AisvLhuZpEv5AmBZEbsyrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The minimal design looks good, but it doesn&apos;t quite have the same great in-hand feel as the Zenfone 9 or Zenfone 10. The phone is available in four color variants — white, black, blue, and peach — but the color is limited to the back, with the sides decked out in black on all four models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AYz5sMp7xiX5oRVkVrcd2Q" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-7.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYz5sMp7xiX5oRVkVrcd2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera module is also in the same black hue across all color variants, and it makes the device look decidedly budget. Most flagship phones have elegant designs with standout colors, and I can&apos;t help but feel that the Zenfone 11 Ultra comes across as plain. ASUS should have matched the sides to the colors at the back, and used a design that has a bit more character; as it stands, the camera island at the back is purely functional with no thought given to aesthetics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-12.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given just how similar the phone is to the ROG Phone 8, ASUS wanted to reuse the same foundation without making too many changes. This saves a ton of costs during manufacturing, so I understand the brand&apos;s reason for doing so. However, the ROG Phone 8 has a distinct visual identity, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra misses out in that area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sdEeBQ3jgspSVCj4h7aBAQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-8.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sdEeBQ3jgspSVCj4h7aBAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design doesn&apos;t really stand out, ASUS is using high-quality materials throughout. The mid-frame is made out of recycled aluminum, the back curves slightly as it meets the sides, so you can easily hold the device, and even though this is a tall and heavy phone, ASUS nailed the weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ERZRAdxNTStT5xF9GKNqpQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-13.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERZRAdxNTStT5xF9GKNqpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island is positioned in such a way that there&apos;s no wobble when using the device on a table. ASUS always offered a 3.5mm jack on its Zenfone series, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra doesn&apos;t miss out in this area — you get the analog jack at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNzyhQ6dKVVBx37E7k7BgQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-14.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNzyhQ6dKVVBx37E7k7BgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because the phone is a rebadged ROG Phone 8, the USB-C port isn&apos;t centered; it sits to the left at the bottom, with the SIM card tray moved to the middle. The reason for this is so that the charging cable doesn&apos;t get in the way when you&apos;re playing a game while charging the phone, but it just looks weird on the Zenfone 11 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zFuYDY3n9RLwxTzZLaiRRQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-10.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zFuYDY3n9RLwxTzZLaiRRQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, there&apos;s no way to charge the device easily if you&apos;re like me and use a phone stand. ASUS should have paid more attention to these design considerations, because as it stands, the Zenfone 11 Ultra doesn&apos;t have much in the way of differentiation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sJryGJyAq9UZEowsr9T7HQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-9.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sJryGJyAq9UZEowsr9T7HQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But you still get IP68 dust and water resistance, and the pane of glass at the back is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The Zenfone 11 Ultra is good to hold and use, but the phone is positioned against flagships, and it just doesn&apos;t have the flair that&apos;s needed in this category. Basically, ASUS went from making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phone</a> to a device that doesn&apos;t quite have a distinct visual identity. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-11-ultra-display"><span>ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jAYTeVsEUgC4i2QhFoshqS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-17.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jAYTeVsEUgC4i2QhFoshqS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS says it got a lot of feedback over the last two years from Zenfone users that wanted a larger device, so the Zenfone 11 Ultra is catered to meet those needs. The phone has a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel, and it gets all the extras you&apos;d want in 2024: it has 120Hz refresh, the screen goes up to 2,500 nits in HDR content, and 1,600 nits in HBM mode. While those figures aren&apos;t as high as the Magic 6 Pro, the Zenfone 11 Ultra manages to get just as bright in daily use scenarios, and that&apos;s what ultimately matters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-22.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has LTPO tech as well, with the panel going down to 1Hz when viewing static content. ASUS tends to calibrate its panels on the cooler side, and that is the case with the Zenfone 11 Ultra as well. That said, you can easily change the color balance via the settings; there are four modes available, and you can use the Customized option to tweak colors to your liking.</p><p>You can set the screen refresh to Auto mode, or manually switch between 60Hz and 120Hz. There&apos;s a gaming mode that pushes the screen refresh to 144Hz, but there&apos;s no way to manually enable it, and it only activates in select titles.</p>
<p>The bezels are noticeably thinner than the Zenfone 10, and the selfie camera cutout is centered. ASUS always delivered good stereo sound on its phones, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra has powerful stereo speakers that are among the loudest in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s8WFocteBqfLisFVrzZ5NU" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-31.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s8WFocteBqfLisFVrzZ5NU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also get a 3.5mm jack, Dirac&apos;s Virtuo tuning in the AudioWizard control panel that makes a legitimate difference when playing games or streaming content — there&apos;s even a 10-band parametric EQ. ASUS is one of very few brands that offers the full AptX suite of audio codecs, so if you&apos;re using a pair of wireless earbuds, there&apos;s a good chance that you&apos;ll be able to stream high-res music.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42pa8sVXNtkYG9JEDDx3dR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-24.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42pa8sVXNtkYG9JEDDx3dR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS has its usual game turbo engine here, and it is among the best you&apos;ll find on any phone. A new addition this year is Video Genie, which is designed to minimize distractions when you&apos;re watching a video. You get the option to mute calls and notifications while a video is playing, and it is a nifty feature.</p>
<p>To round things off, you get an always-on mode, but the clock styles are fairly limited, and you don&apos;t get much in the way of customizability. Other than that, the Zenfone 11 Ultra ticks all the right boxes; the screen is large and vibrant, you get a lot of useful extras, and it is a delight to use for gaming and playing videos.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-11-ultra-hardware"><span>ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra: Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fk8vonKa4pPPFKCDx9GJVR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-19.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fk8vonKa4pPPFKCDx9GJVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS knows what it&apos;s doing when it comes to the hardware, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra has zero issues in this particular area. The device is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and you get 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage as standard. There&apos;s also a 16GB/512GB model if you need more storage, but there isn&apos;t a 1TB version.</p><p>Just like ASUS&apos;s gaming phones, there are no slowdowns whatsoever in daily use, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra is one of the fastest phones you can buy at the moment. ASUS did a terrific job optimizing the hardware with ZenUI, and it is fluid like no other device in this segment. However, I noticed a few instances where apps crashed at launch, but by and large, there are no problems in daily use.</p>
<p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra is terrific at gaming as well, and it delivers stable framerates in demanding titles with no issues. ASUS isn&apos;t throttling the chipset this time, so it tends to overheat during extended gaming sessions, but not to a point where it gets uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But in the Solar Bay stress test, the device got so hot that I wasn&apos;t able to hold it. It went up to 58 degrees, and that is second only to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Nubia Z60 Ultra</a>, which hit 60 degrees. Most 2024 phones I tested didn&apos;t go beyond 44 degrees, and while the Zenfone 11 Ultra gets noticeably hotter than its rivals, it doesn&apos;t go anywhere close to that 58-degree mark in regular use. Although it gets hot, there is no noticeable throttling while gaming, and the stability score of 77.1% in Solar Bay is one of the highest of any device. </p><p>There isn&apos;t anything missing on the connectivity front, with the Zenfone 11 Ultra featuring a modem that has Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 7, global Sub-6 5G bands, NFC, and dual-band GPS. ASUS did a good job with the haptic engine as well, and you get granular feedback while using the keyboard and navigating the interface.</p><p>Barring a few glitches that have been addressed in the latest software build, I didn&apos;t see any issues with the Zenfone 11 Ultra — ASUS once again delivered one of the best hardware packages in the segment. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AYz5sMp7xiX5oRVkVrcd2Q" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-7.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYz5sMp7xiX5oRVkVrcd2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS took full advantage of the increased real estate, and fitted a 5500mAh battery inside the Zenfone 11 Ultra. The result is that the phone lasts up to two days with medium use, and I got a day and a half even with heavy use. Battery anxiety is largely nonexistent in 2024, but the Zenfone 11 Ultra has a distinct edge over its rivals, delivering at least an hour of additional screen-on-time.</p><p>The phone uses the standard USB PD 3.0 charging protocol, and charges at 65W. You even get wireless charging here, going up to 15W over the Qi 1.3 standard. But what&apos;s annoying is that there is no charger in the box; ASUS is emulating Samsung in this regard, and you&apos;ll need to buy a USB PD charger to use with the Zenfone 11 Ultra if you don&apos;t have one. This is a real shame considering the bundled ASUS chargers were particularly good at charging a variety of other products.</p>

<p>ASUS has steadily refined its cameras over the last two years, and the Zenfone 11 Ultra builds on this with a versatile package that includes three lenses. The main camera is a 50MP Sony IMX90 with a 6-axis gimbal stabilization system. The gimbal stabilizer makes a ton of difference when shooting videos, and I&apos;m glad that ASUS retained it this time around. While the IMX890 is showing its age, ASUS says it went with the module as it was easy to integrate with the gimbal stabilizer.</p><p>There&apos;s also a 13MP wide-angle lens with 120-degree field of view, and a new addition is a 32MP telephoto lens with OIS that does 3x optical zoom. The lens goes up to 30x digitally, but in my usage, I found that it delivered usable shots up to 5x. Up front, you&apos;ll find a 32MP module with 90-degree FoV that uses 4-to-1 pixel binning to deliver 8MP shots.</p>

<p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra takes stellar photos in daylight scenarios, with resultant shots offering great dynamic range and color accuracy. The camera tuning skews toward accurate color rendition, and while there is aggressive smoothening when it comes to foliage, the camera holds its own against other flagships.</p><p>The wide-angle lens is quite decent too, and it manages to deliver photos with the same color balance as the main lens. I was excited to try out the 3x zoom lens, and while it does a good job most of the time, there&apos;s still some work that needs to be done to tune the sensor.</p><p>You get detailed images in low-light scenarios as well, and ASUS was definitely able to eke the most out of the Sony sensor. There&apos;s some fringing at times and you miss out on details, but on the whole, the main camera is great in low-light situations. It takes a second to save photos to the gallery, but other than that, there isn&apos;t a lot that&apos;s wrong.</p><p>The auxiliary lenses are strictly average in challenging scenarios, and they just don&apos;t measure up to what other flagships offer. Another area where ASUS misses out is taking photos of fast-moving objects; it just isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the Pixels or the Find X7 Ultra in these situations.</p><p>The cameras are the best of any Zenfone I used thus far, and ASUS got a lot of things right in this area. That said, other brands raised the bar considerably in 2024, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> and Find X7 Ultra delivering huge gains. The Zenfone 11 Ultra just doesn&apos;t measure up against those devices, and it isn&apos;t on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in this regard.</p>

<p>I tested the Zenfone 11 Ultra with the 34.1420.1420.226 build, and this is the retail version that will be available on consumer devices. ASUS mentions that the build will be available as a day-one OTA update, so if you don&apos;t see all the software features out of the box, you&apos;ll need to update your phone.</p><p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra runs the latest iteration of ZenUI on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and ASUS is doing a great job with its UI efforts. The interface itself is clean and doesn&apos;t have any bloatware, and you can&apos;t say that about most phones in this segment — the Pixel 8 Pro is the only other device that comes to mind.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="my5KYm8a9P7ZVsCn7dxrKS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-18.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/my5KYm8a9P7ZVsCn7dxrKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like with ZenUI is that it gives you plenty of customizability across the board. The notification pane has three styles: ASUS Optimized is the usual option that switches to the older Android system, you can choose Stock Android that has large tiles similar to what you get on a Pixel, and there&apos;s a new mode that splits the notification pane in two — with toggles on one side, and notifications on the other.</p>
<p>The UI itself is fluid, and there are no issues in daily use. But the only issue is that ASUS is aggressive with memory management, and I had issues with push notifications at times. This was a problem last year as well, and while there is a setting to disable battery optimization individually, that doesn&apos;t do much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-21.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS is rolling out a suite of AI features with the device, and these include AI Call Translator, AI Transcript, AI Wallpaper, and AI Noise Cancellation. AI Call Translator is baked into the ASUS phone dialer, and it delivers real-time translations when you&apos;re talking to someone in another language.</p>
<p>You also get the ability to create unique backgrounds on the fly, but the feature I like the most is AI Transcript. It transcribes audio — when using the built-in sound recorder — and it does a brilliant job. I normally use a standalone recorder when conducting interviews, but I decided to just take the Zenfone 11 Ultra when talking to Nothing&apos;s co-founder, and it did a great job picking up audio and transcribing it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="va6rpjKAX9Ni3xxccUSqVS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-25.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/va6rpjKAX9Ni3xxccUSqVS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS says the recorder works in eight languages, and transcribing is done on-device — no data is sent to the cloud. There&apos;s a nifty summary mode that basically summaries the contents of the audio, and this feature relies on the cloud. ASUS introduced Semantic Search debuted on the Zenfone 10, and the feature is available here as well. It uses metadata and contextual information to surface images in the gallery and pull up relevant sub-menus in the settings.</p>
<p>ZenUI now has Phone Link built-in, and ASUS has its own GlideX control panel that lets you use your phone with your Windows machine. The Taiwanese manufacturer is also introducing Qualcomm Seamless; the feature isn&apos;t available just yet, but will go live later in the year, and it lets you seamlessly switch between your phone and Windows machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t66EQk5WgPM32DpCkJBZfS" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-23.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t66EQk5WgPM32DpCkJBZfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main issue with ZenUI is software updates, or lack thereof. ASUS guarantees two Android platform updates with the Zenfone 11 Ultra, and four years of security updates. There&apos;s just no way this is adequate on a phone that costs $899 in 2024, and it severely limits the device.</p>
<p>ASUS maintains that it has limited engineering resources and it cannot deliver more than two updates, but there are brands like Nothing that have fewer resources but still guarantee three updates on budget phones like the Phone (2a), so ASUS doesn&apos;t have an excuse in this area. With Google and Samsung now offering seven updates and the rest of the field guaranteeing four platform updates, the Zenfone 11 Ultra is woefully behind.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 Pro is the obvious alternative to the Zenfone 11 Ultra, with Google also offering a clean interface that doesn&apos;t have any bloatware. The Pixel 8 Pro isn&apos;t as powerful, nor does it last as long. However, you get a much better camera system, seven years of software updates, and the design looks much better. As a flagship, the Pixel 8 Pro just has much more to offer.</p><p>If you want to maximize value, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is a good choice to consider. The software isn&apos;t anywhere as good as what you get on the Zenfone 11 Ultra, but you get powerful hardware, a gorgeous design, stellar battery life, and versatile cameras that take terrific photos.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-11-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EohEk4M9Mccoe7RoKhcuXT" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-28.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EohEk4M9Mccoe7RoKhcuXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a large phone with terrific hardware</li><li>You need a phone with the best battery life</li><li>You want clean software with plenty of useful features</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need long-term Android updates</li><li>You want flagship cameras</li><li>You need a charger in the box</li></ul>
<p>When you&apos;re paying $899 for a phone, you want the absolute best that&apos;s available. To its credit, ASUS got a lot right with the Zenfone 11 Ultra; the phone is one of the fastest around, the battery lasts longer than just about any other phone I used in 2024, and the clean software is a delight to use. You even get a few AI features that are actually meaningful, and ZenUI continues to be one of my favorite Android skins.</p><p>The cameras take better photos than previous ASUS phones as well, and it&apos;s good to see ASUS make good strides in this area. That said, they&apos;re still not quite on the same level as other flagships. The Pixel 8 Pro, Honor Magic 6 Pro, and even the OnePlus 12 outmatch the Zenfone 11 Ultra in most scenarios, and ASUS needs to do more if it wants to hold its own against other flagships.</p><p>But the biggest issue with the Zenfone 11 Ultra is that it will just get two software updates. That&apos;s not enough for a budget phone, much less a device that costs $899. Every other phone in this segment gives you at least twice as many updates, and while the Zenfone 11 Ultra clearly has a lot to offer, the pitiful update policy is ultimately a deal-breaker.</p>

But its future in the US is uncertain; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/house-passes-bill-could-ban-tiktok">lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are pushing for a ban</a>, citing national security concerns and issues with content moderation and potential for abuse. </p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time TikTok has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-wechat-be-banned-us-app-stores-sunday-september-20">been under the microscope</a>, but it is the first time a potential impact on consumers is likely to happen — this isn&apos;t one person signing a piece of paper, it&apos;s the entire U.S. Congress poised to oust the service. </p><p>You might not be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/uk-bans-tiktok-app-on-government-phones">install TikTok on your government-issued smartphone</a>, but unless something happens to satisfy members of Congress, TikTok might be going away. Let&apos;s delve into the reasons behind this potential ban.</p>
<h2 id="the-quot-data-security-quot-argument-2">The "Data Security" argument</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VMwhQjhhccVMDDkifUPED7" name="Google-Pixel-6-pro-privacy-dashboard.jpg" alt="Pixel 6 Pro Privacy Dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VMwhQjhhccVMDDkifUPED7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The central fear revolves around user data. ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns TikTok; unfortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">that&apos;s the real problem</a>. U.S. lawmakers worry that the Chinese government could pressure ByteDance to hand over user data, potentially including location information, browsing habits, and even private messages. This data, they fear, could be used for espionage or to influence American public opinion, particularly during elections.</p><p>The U.S. has a tense relationship with China, and concerns about intellectual property theft and Chinese government influence are well-documented. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/national-intelligence-law-of-the-p-r-c-2017/">2017 Chinese law</a> compels companies to "support, cooperate with and provide assistance" with national intelligence work. This fuels anxiety that user data on TikTok could be weaponized by the Chinese government.</p><p>These concerns ignore the elephant in the room: your government does the same thing. They all do. Chinese companies agree to this sort of law upfront, but in the West, companies agree to be compelled to hand the same data over later once an officer of the court tells them to do it.</p><p>If lawmakers are really that concerned, the ability of the U.S. government to weaponize user data should be addressed, too. Stronger data privacy laws and concerns should not be a regional or national issue.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-misinformation-and-saving-the-kids-2">Preventing misinformation and saving the kids</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="78zU9daCHEMkTFE8zMYLoT" name="amazon fire hd 10 kids 2023 lifestyle image 1.jpg" alt="amazon fire hd 10 kids 2023 lifestyle image 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78zU9daCHEMkTFE8zMYLoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another concern is the potential for manipulating content on the platform. TikTok&apos;s powerful algorithm tailors content feeds to user preferences, creating echo chambers where users are exposed only to information that reinforces their existing beliefs. Lawmakers fear the Chinese government could exploit this by promoting propaganda or misinformation through seemingly innocuous videos. This could distort public perception and undermine democratic processes.</p><p>Beyond national security, some lawmakers worry about the app&apos;s impact on children&apos;s mental health. The endless scroll of short, often addictive videos can create feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Additionally, the platform has been criticized for its prevalence of cyberbullying and exposure to inappropriate content.</p><p>These are valid points here that apply (or should apply) to Meta (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-cant-trust-facebook">FaceBook</a>), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-23-million-dollar-search-privacy-settlement">Google</a>, X (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-removes-option-to-report-misleading-information">Twitter</a>), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smart-home/amazon-admits-releasing-ring-video-footage-without-consent">Amazon</a> with the same gusto. The difference? Once again, China.</p>
<h2 id="two-sides-to-every-coin-2">Two sides to every coin</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wnozZ6bQew7zWZViGPt29" name="tiktok-app-playing-video.jpg" alt="TikTok playing video of a squirrel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wnozZ6bQew7zWZViGPt29.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TikTok vehemently denies all these allegations. It claims to store U.S. user data outside of China and that the Chinese government has no control over its algorithm. It also argues that a ban would stifle free speech and harm millions of American creators and businesses that rely on the platform for their livelihoods.</p><p>The company may be right. Storing user data elsewhere prevents it from being presented to China on demand, and taking away TikTok puts millions out of work. However, TikTok isn&apos;t doing itself any favors when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-owner-boosts-china-ties-invests-in-state-backed-chip-firm">partners with a 100% state-owned Chinese semiconductor company</a> while under congressional investigation in the U.S.</p><p>The debate over TikTok is complicated. There are genuine concerns about data security and potential manipulation, but a complete ban that prevents you from using TikTok on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> might be an overly blunt instrument. Not all problems are nails and not all solutions are hammers.</p><p>Some possible solutions being discussed include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Forced divestiture:</strong> The US could pressure <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-bytedance-xr-partnership">ByteDance</a> to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to an American company, thereby severing the link to the Chinese government.</li><li><strong>Enhanced data security measures:</strong> Stricter regulations and independent audits could ensure user data remains safe within US borders.</li><li><strong>Content moderation:</strong> Working with TikTok to implement stricter content moderation policies could address concerns about harmful content and misinformation.</li></ul>
<h2 id="an-uncertain-future-for-tiktok-2">An uncertain future for TikTok</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Fry5jUnD6WcJkbKg66reAH" name="chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review-tiktok.jpg" alt="TikTok pre-installed on Chromecast with Google TV HD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fry5jUnD6WcJkbKg66reAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether a ban will materialize is yet to be seen. The House of Representatives recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D">passed a bill that could lead to a ban</a>, but it still needs Senate approval and Presidential signature. Negotiations and potential compromises are likely before a final decision is reached.</p><p>The future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the app has become a focal point in a larger discussion about national security, data privacy, and the influence of social media platforms in the digital age. These are discussions that need to be had, and whether you&apos;re in favor of a potential TikTok ban or opposed to it, you should agree that we need to talk about it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-amazon-spring-sale-2">What is the Amazon Spring Sale?</h2>
<p>Amazon typically does three major sale events every year. Just like Prime Day and Big Deal Days in October, the Amazon Spring Sale is a sitewide shopping event with loads of great deals for Prime members and non-members alike. It usually lasts for two or three days and gives customers an opportunity to save some serious cash on tech outside of the regular shopping season.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-amazon-spring-sale-2">When is the Amazon Spring Sale?</h2>
<p>We don&apos;t have final dates yet, but they&apos;re likely coming soon. The 2023 Spring Sale was March 27th through 29th, while the 2022 event was hosted in early April. If I had to guess, I&apos;d predict that the sale could start as early as next week. We&apos;ll update this page with final information once we know for sure. </p>
<h2 id="will-other-retailers-be-doing-sales-xa0-2">Will other retailers be doing sales? </h2>
<p>Almost certainly. Whenever Amazon does a big sale event like this, it doesn&apos;t take long for its biggest competitors to follow suit. Expect sitewide sales from Best Buy and Walmart, not to mention Android-friendly retailers and wireless carriers like Samsung and Verizon. We&apos;ll be sharing the best deals from those folks when we learn more. </p>

<ul><li>Emoji reaction effects are available for SMS or RCS messages. </li><li>Ten total reactions are available to users, and each will send a unique animated effect.</li><li>Currently, the feature cannot be disabled for users who are not interested. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is introducing emoji reaction effects that are set to enhance the conversational experience on Google messages.</p><p>For example, a thumbs-up reaction sends several animated thumbs-up icons, while a crying face emoji reaction sends an animated umbrella complete with rain effects. </p><p>To take advantage of this newly deployed feature, users simply need to long-press on a message, either SMS or RCS, and they will be able to select the appropriate reaction from a designated list of 10. </p><p>The 10 reactions are as follows: thumbs up, thumbs down, red heart, face with tears of joy, face with open mouth, enraged face, angry face, crying face, party popper, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:365px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:205.48%;"><img id="MM7mCrJRjZGuij5vugiN4g" name="Google-Messages-reaction-effects-2.jpg" alt="Google Emoji Reaction Effects" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MM7mCrJRjZGuij5vugiN4g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="365" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future (Derrek Lee))</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new update follows Google’s introduction of Photomoji, animated emojis, and screen effects. While it was initially revealed back in November as part of a larger message update to celebrate Messages’ 1 billion RCS users, it took a bit to actually make its way to handhelds. </p><p>At the time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/7-new-messages-features/">Google said</a>, “This feature, designed to add a dynamic twist to your chats, embraces the power of expression with all ten of these popular emoji.” </p><p>While these effects may be appealing to many users, other users may not see the same benefit. As it stands, those users are unable to disable the reactions, though that might change in the future. </p><p>In all, the latest update brings Google Messages more in line with the competing iMessage, which is available on Apple’s ecosystem. Previously, iMessage carried such effects, albeit with a different deployment mechanism. Regardless, this update will help add more fun to chats, and fun is always worth celebrating.</p>

<ul><li>Users will be able to access their camera's history from the web, which has been optimized for mouse and keyboard.</li><li>The ability to create custom clips and download them is now available.</li><li>Users can opt-in to Public Preview to test out new features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Home for Web just got a lot more comprehensive as part of a new update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Google-Home-Access-camera-history-and-download-clips-from-the-Web-and-more/ba-p/605573">Announced by the tech giant on Wednesday</a>, many requested features are making their way to the web. In particular, users will be able to view full histories and create custom clips. </p><p>Per the company, over the next several days, home.google.com will now allow users to take advantage of having access to a larger screen. The newly updated experience, which has been optimized for use with a traditional mouse and keyboard, will allow users to access their entire camera history. From there, users can view specific events and timelines or search for specific dates and times to review. It’s important to note that a Nest Aware Plus subscription will be required for 24/7 playback on the web as it is required on the app. </p><p>Another noteworthy feature rolling out is the ability to create custom clips. Users will be able to designate the duration of the clip on the web by using the added clip editor. Additionally, previous events can be trimmed via the Home app. Nest Aware Plus subscribers can go a step further and export those clips as downloadable files to then be shared or saved. </p><p>The last – and potentially biggest – update is the ability for users to participate in a version of Public Preview for the web. This will allow users to sample features before they become widely available to the public. Interested users can opt in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-to-join-public-preview">here</a>, per the company. </p><p>Some unique features available in the preview include a script editor for home automation, garage door detection, and expanded first-generation camera support. In the first feature, users can see, create, delete, or deactivate scripted automation via home.google.com. </p><p>Garage door detection, available only to Nest Aware subscribers, will notify users if they happen to leave their garage door open. The feature uses “advanced AI-powered image detection and improved built-in on-device intelligence” to help users keep their homes secure. Finally, first-generation Nest Cam indoor or outdoor users can use a new camera history experience in the Google Home app as part of the public preview. </p><p>Overall, Google Home continues to demonstrate why it is a must-have for those who want to make their homes smart. </p>

<hr>
<p>A huge new UI upgrade is coming to the Meta Quest some time this year, and Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth gave us the first details in his March AMA <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/boztank/">on Instagram</a>. The CTO said he didn&apos;t want to "give too much away" before the big reveal but talked about how the company was working to make the Quest UI feel more personalized than ever.</p><p>Bosworth said this new personalized UI would be designed to go wherever life takes you, including the ability to pin windows to you or your head. That would make it possible to walk around and have windows follow you while you do chores or walk around the house.</p><p>Bosworth also said the company is working on allowing users to anchor windows in real space, giving the headset similar abilities to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a> even though it&apos;s 1/7th the price. This means you could pin a display to your wall and make it look and feel more like a TV resting in actual space, among other examples. It would also enhance the headset&apos;s multitasking capabilities by running more windows in the same physical space.</p><p>While the current Meta Quest UI can replicate some of these things with its panel design, Bosworth says that "fluidity with how you interact with these two things is of tremendous opportunity to make things feel really comfortable and clear."</p><p>The new UI will also allow users to interact better with other nearby devices. Bosworth talked about how "casting and streaming present a lot of opportunity" for Meta. Still, we&apos;ve also seen use cases where users can interact with smart home appliances and lighting right in mixed reality. In other words, if Meta is working on integrating nearby device connectivity, we could very well be able to adjust lights and other smart home devices right from the headset.</p>

<p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3 Lite</a> was rumored to drop the color pass through at one point, but Bosworth confirmed that "mixed reality...platform capabilities will be the same" for "several generations of headsets to come."</p><p>Bosworth also talked about user comfort including bringing back the ability to use the Meta Quest 3 while lying down. Currently, the Smart Guardian doesn&apos;t properly track furniture walls safely when users are lying down stationary, but the company says this oversight will be ironed out soon.</p><p>Lastly, the keyboard is getting some impressive improvements with multitouch capabilities. That means you could pin the virtual keyboard to a table and type with all your fingers at once, just as you would on a physical keyboard. That would go quite nicely with the upcoming Airplane mode, as it could mean the virtual keyboard would fit perfectly on that small airplane tray table on the seat.</p><p>There&apos;s no date for the upcoming UI refresh, but it&apos;s expected that Meta will debut the redesign sometime in 2024, potentially alongside a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> announcement.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube is preparing to roll out a redesign for its TV app in the "next few weeks" that brings a "dual column" view.</li><li>Interacting with a video's title will shift your content to the left, creating space for its description box, comment section, and more on the right.</li><li>The redesign will arrive for YouTube TV subscribers, as well, as the users can check a game's key plays and stats without blocking what they're watching.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube attributes its upcoming TV redesign to user feedback highlighting the need for a "richer, distraction-free" video experience on the large screen.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/designing-a-richer-youtube-experience-for-your-tvs/">YouTube</a>, its TV redesign was crafted on the back of wanting to keep its video content "front and center" at all times. The primary change is that opening a video&apos;s comments, description, or live chat no longer blocks off the right side of what you&apos;re watching.</p><p>YouTube states users found that its previous approach obscured the video too much. So, clicking a video&apos;s title with your remote control will produce the new "dual column" redesign, shifting the video to the left. The right side will host the title, video statistics, description box, and comments section.</p><p>The video users are currently watching on TV will shrink slightly, considering it needs to make room for additional content. YouTube&apos;s addition should help enhance the experience when scrolling through a video&apos;s chapters, key plays, shopping moments, and keeping track of scores.</p><p>Additionally, watching a full-screen video will display the like, dislike, CC (closed captioning), and gear (settings) icons. Sliding back to the video while in this new dual-column view should let users return to full screen.</p>

<p>YouTube prototyped a few different redesign versions before settling on its "dual column" approach. One of its goals was to ensure it struck the right balance between what users want (their video) and YouTube&apos;s interactive controls. Using a remote control should continue to feel comfortable as the platform prioritizes "simplicity over the introduction of lightweight controls."</p><p>YouTube adds that a "one size fits all" approach will likely not work for <em>everything </em>it offers its viewers. An example would be the platform&apos;s live chat, as the post states that it would "benefit from different levels of immersion" moving forward.</p><p>This dual-column TV redesign is set to arrive in the "next few weeks" for the YouTube app. The platform is also preparing to bring this to YouTube TV subscribers so they can explore key plays or game stats without removing them from the action.</p><p>Back in February, YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-8-million-subscribers-2024-outlook">celebrated its achievement</a> of 8 million subscribers. The company also made it clear that it wanted to place more focus on living room viewers as folks have tallied an average of 1 billion hours watched from a TV. Those watching YouTube on a TV are in line for reworks in 2024, and it looks like this is the start of those enhancements.</p>

<hr>
<p>Spotify is rolling out music videos for Premium users in beta today (Mar. 13), but they won&apos;t be available to everyone simultaneously.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-13/music-videos-rolling-out-in-beta-to-premium-spotify-users-across-select-markets/">Newsroom</a> post, Spotify is bringing music videos to its platform for users on Android, iOS, desktops, and TVs. Users should find a "Switch to video" toggle when listening to a song that supports the music video feature. Spotify explains that the video will play directly in the "Now Playing" view on your phone or other device.</p><p>There is a full-screen option; users can turn their phone sideways to view the music video alternately. Spotify&apos;s music videos cannot be played in the background, nor does it seem to have a pop-out option.</p><p>The music streaming service states users should switch back to audio if they&apos;re moving away from the app.</p><p>This beta for Spotify&apos;s music videos for support titles means the platform will look to "continue to innovate and iterate based on feedback from both users and artists." Music videos will be featured for select artists like Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat, Ice Spice, Aluna, and Asake. More titles will likely be available as part of Spotify&apos;s "limited catalog" starting out.</p><p>The feature will arrive in 11 regions: the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Kenya. The U.S. is notably out of the equation <em>for now</em>. Spotify states as its beta progresses and more work is done, it will look to expand music videos to more countries.</p>
<p>Spotify highlighted its interest in boosting user engagement within its platform and mentioned several features like Canvas and Clips. However, this new music video beta puts Spotify into more competition with YouTube Music. The latter already offers a way for Premium subscribers to quickly swap between <em>listening </em>to a song and watching its music video.</p><p>YouTube Music previously let free users in on its music videos for song titles, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music-free-tier-video-limitation">disappeared back in 2019</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Display analyst Ross Young spilled some beans about the display sizes of the upcoming Pixel Fold 2.</li><li>It will have a prominent 8.02-inch foldable screen and a 6.29-inch cover screen.</li><li>Young further shared that these displays will enter the production phase this April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Pixel Fold 2 is Google&apos;s highly anticipated foldable device, which will likely debut sometime during Google I/O later this year. Before the release, new information reveals the foldable&apos;s display sizes that are likely to feature.</p><p>According to the well-known display analyst Ross Young, the Pixel Fold 2 will likely feature a large 8.02-inch foldable display accompanied by a 6.29-inch cover screen. Young notes that display sizes circulating as Pixel Fold 2 aren&apos;t entirely accurate.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The leaks on the Pixel Fold 2 don't have the display sizes right. 8.02" for the foldable display and 6.29" for the cover display. Panel production starts in April! It is coming.<a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1767687195090161769">March 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2-renders">first renders</a> of the Pixel Fold 2 surfaced last month, revealing the foldable&apos;s design and other details, including display sizes of 7.9 inches and 6.4 inches, respectively. However, these new screen sizes from Young reveal more prominent screens than the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. The previous iteration had a 7.6-inch foldable screen and a 5.8-inch cover screen.</p><p>Young has further revealed that the panels above will be produced in April. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1767692161217388784">follow-up tweet</a>, Young also shared that the cover screen would be comprehensive, similar to or better than the original Pixel Fold.</p>

<p>According to the recent Pixel Fold 2 renders, however, when compared side by side with the Pixel Fold cover screen, the original appears wider than the alleged one. Since those are early renders, they might change with the phone&apos;s final release.</p><p>The same renders still revealed interesting details of the Pixel Fold 2, which is the new camera housing that has been completely revamped, from the signature bar design to a new rectangular housing. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> will likely carry at least three sensors accompanied by another unknown sensor. There is a selfie camera on the cover screen, and another hidden sensor is expected within the foldable screen, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 spec sheet leaves little to be desired, with the cutting-edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 8GB of RAM, a microSD slot for expandable storage, and durable battery life. Since it&apos;s a Samsung product, you&apos;re getting a best-in-class display — coming in at 11 inches with an ultra-smooth 120Hz refresh rate — and a scratch-resistant aluminum build. You also get extras like excellent quad speakers, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and an S Pen stylus included in the box. Plus, you can attach a keyboard cover to get some work done and then jump into the DeX desktop-style interface for a more laptop-like experience.</p><p>Most importantly, Samsung’s One UI 5.1.1 software makes multitasking on the Tab S9 remarkably easy. You simply drag your favorite apps from the pinned taskbar onto the display, and the UI automatically splits them into resizable windows or squeezes them into compact pop-up windows. Still, with a starting price of around $799, the Tab S9 isn&apos;t exactly cheap, but it&apos;s considerably more affordable than the other tablets in the lineup, the S9 Plus and S9 Ultra. And like all of the best Samsung devices out there, the S9 will receive four years of major Android updates along with five years of security updates.</p>

Combined with the impressive 90% screen-to-body ratio, the display size makes it the champion for fitting multiple full-sized apps at once; and you can buy a backlit keyboard cover with a trackpad, converting it into a modular laptop.</p><p>The downside of its design is that the Tab S9 Ultra’s tiny bezels leave you no room to hold it without accidental touches, while also exposing a notch that you’ll have to learn to ignore. You essentially have to use it docked, and the official keyboard cover ships separately and costs a healthy amount. Combined with the RAM upgrade, a fully-specced and accessorized Ultra will cost you about the same as a premium laptop.</p><p>If that’s a problem, you could settle for the also-great Tab S9 (described above). But if you can afford it, or you simply want the most powerful Android tablet on the market regardless of price, you’re getting excellent performance and a massive slab for gaming, streaming, and working with the S9 Ultra. You merely have to accept that it’s not at all portable. As stated in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra review</a>, this is the ultimate tablet and laptop replacement, but its size might prevent it from becoming the ultimate couch companion.</p>

<p>To call the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> highly anticipated would be an understatement. We’d been waiting for Google to get back into the tablet game for years, and although it’s far from a dramatic return, the Pixel Tablet certainly doesn’t disappoint. It should basically be a perfect tablet for most people (unless you&apos;re a gamer), complete with a vibrant display, some excellent battery life, and all the Google software support you could ever ask for. It even comes with a Charging Speaker Dock, a useful little stand that converts your tablet into a smart display.</p><p>Now, there are a few quirks with the Pixel Tablet. The bezels, for one, are strangely large, and there’s no 3.5mm audio port to help make up for the weak speaker quality. All in all, though, we found the tablet to be sufficiently powerful for most tasks, and if you’re a Pixel fan, there’s really no reason to skip this device. Holding it in your hands almost feels like you’re using an oversized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>, and that’s a good thing. </p>

<p>The best Android tablet for most people tends to come from Samsung or Amazon, but don&apos;t sleep on Lenovo, which makes a series of near-stock Android tablets for premium and budget shoppers. Coming in as a successor of sorts to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-tab-p11-pro-gen-2-review">Lenovo Tab P11 Pro Gen 2</a>, the Tab P12 has a few tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>Notably, the Tab P12 sports a 12.7-inch 3K display, bringing a resolution of 2944 x 1870. The only potential downside here is that Lenovo is using an LCD panel as opposed to an OLED screen. But, if you suffer from issues surrounding PWM, then this is probably seen as a big benefit.</p><p>From a software perspective, Lenovo is implementing different ways to stand out from the pack. This is evidenced by the "Chromatic" and "Mono" modes that turn the Tab P12 into an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">e-reader</a>. Lenovo even includes background songs for you to listen to so you can immerse yourself in the world of whatever books you are reading.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking to buy a tablet for the first time and don&apos;t have any stringent needs, the Galaxy Tab A series is an excellent option for a fraction of the Tab S9&apos;s cost. While you won&apos;t be blown away by its specs or features, the Tab A still manages to offer a metal body. And unlike Amazon&apos;s Fire Tablets, it has a fully functional version of Android with Google services like the Play Store, so you can download any apps you want.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab A8 is a great option for those in the market looking for an entry-level tablet that offers a traditional Android experience. The smaller display and overall design make the Tab A8 extremely portable and comfortable to hold in one hand while still being large enough to consume media from streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and Disney+.</p>

In 2023, Amazon proved that it&apos;s trying to offer more than just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">super-cheap tablets</a>, as evidenced by the Fire Max 11.</p><p>Ditching the build with chonky bezels, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is sleek and well-built, turning in plastic for aluminum. While the company hasn&apos;t made the jump to OLED panels just yet, this 11-inch IPS screen is quite impressive. Not to mention that it&apos;s great for movies, getting work done, or acting as a smart display.</p><p>Amazon also offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-accessories-for-amazon-fire-max-11">detachable keyboard</a> and USI pen for the Fire Max 11. These, paired with the 14 hours of battery life, ensure that you&apos;ll be able to take notes and finish assignments with ease. The Fire Max 11 Productivity Bundle even includes three months of Microsoft 365 if you need an easy way to share files or access Microsoft&apos;s suite of productivity apps.</p><p>The big caveat to keep in mind with an Amazon Fire Tablet is that you don&apos;t get the Google Play Store or Google&apos;s great apps and services. Instead, you&apos;ll rely on the Amazon App Store, which has a dramatically more limited app selection. But for this price, that&apos;s an OK trade-off for most people, especially for students on a budget.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>There are a lot of factors that go into deciding whether the best Android tablet is right for you. Price is likely the most important factor, but that also ties into the value of a tablet. For example, just because the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is the most expensive Android tablet doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that it&apos;s the absolute best. There are plenty of great tablets that will work for your needs but won&apos;t break the bank.</p><p>Size is another important factor, but this also depends on what it is that you&apos;re trying to accomplish by purchasing a new tablet. If you just want a lightweight media consumption device that&apos;s not your laptop, then devices larger than 10 inches might not be right for you. But if you are planning to get some work done away from your desk or the office, then a tablet with a larger screen will be the better fit.</p><p>With those two factors taken into consideration, you&apos;ll want to look at other features such as battery life, screen resolution, camera quality, and design. There&apos;s also the question of the "intangibles." Does the tablet include a stylus? Is there a detachable keyboard available? Is that included? What about cases? Are case options limited to first-party options, or are there a bunch of third-party solutions to pick from? These are all questions we consider when performing our reviews, along with determining which Android tablet is "the best."</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3>
<p>Along with the questions and factors that we outlined above, when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-review-and-recommendation-process">reviewing and testing</a> these devices, we try to take into account every other possible detail. For example, we look at the build quality and durability of different tablets that come across our desks, short of doing actual bend tests.</p><p>Because we&apos;ll be looking at these screens for long periods of time, we want to know the same things as you, including if you can actually see the tablet under direct sunlight. How does the latest Netflix hit look, and what about HDR or Dolby Atmos compatibility? Speakers are another big thing with tablets since you shouldn&apos;t always have to reach for a pair of headphones if you&apos;re watching a movie.</p><p>And circling back, there are the aforementioned "intangibles" to consider, such as determining whether you can actually use a tablet as a laptop replacement of sorts, depending on the model. Plus, there&apos;s the whole question of battery life, as you don&apos;t want to end up with a tablet that can&apos;t even make it through the latest Marvel movie without needing some juice. All of these factors play an important role in making our final determination and providing a score for the review.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-of-the-best-android-tablets-should-you-buy-2">Which of the best Android tablets should you buy?</h2>
<p>Picking a quality Android tablet typically boils down to either Samsung or Amazon models. Samsung dominates the premium and mid-range tablet market while competing with Amazon via its cheaper, budget A-models. So when weighing the best Android tablet for you, specifically, start with Samsung unless you don&apos;t have much money to spend.</p><p>In terms of the “best” without regard to money, it’s a toss-up between the three Tab S9 models. The 11-inch Galaxy Tab S9 is the best mainstream pick, coming in lighter, brighter, and more affordable than its larger siblings while sporting the same flagship Snapdragon chip. It even has the longest battery life of the bunch at about 15 hours.</p><p>Then again, you might want to consider the Galaxy Tab S9+ instead. You’ll trade in the S8’s basic LCD panel for a 12.4-inch AMOLED, giving you richer colors, deeper blacks, and more screen space for fitting in multiple apps at once. It also has a shorter S Pen latency at just 2.8ms, so short that you’ll feel like you’re writing on actual paper. Though more expensive and less comfortable to hold, the Tab S9+ display justifies the upgrade.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra measures a massive 14.6 inches and 1.6 pounds with tiny bezels, making it wholly unsuitable for casual streaming in bed, but perfect as a laptop replacement using Samsung DeX mode. It’s the Android equivalent of the iPad Pro, with the price and power to match. If you want an Android tablet with more than 8GB of RAM, this is your best (and only) choice.</p><p>Dropping into the mid-range category, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> provides the same display size and battery as the S9+ for about half the price, if you can stomach some performance downgrades.</p><p>But for true affordability and value, you’ll want to look at Amazon’s catalog, starting with Amazon&apos;s Fire Max 11. The specs are nothing to write home about, but performance is surprisingly good, and you get a great media consumption device for a highly competitive price. The only catch? The Fire Max 11 runs Amazon&apos;s Fire OS rather than a more typical Android build, meaning you&apos;ll need to download apps from Amazon&apos;s app store rather than Google&apos;s.</p>
<h2 id="is-getting-a-tablet-worth-it-2">Is getting a tablet worth it?</h2>
<p>This is a question only <em>you</em> can really answer, but a better question might be "what do I want or need a tablet for?" If you&apos;re looking to replace an aging laptop with a tablet, there aren&apos;t as many options available, and instead, you might be better suited with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">great Chromebook</a>.</p><p>Determining what it is that you&apos;re planning on using the tablet for is the first step of the equation. Because if you don&apos;t have an actual use case for the device, then it&apos;ll likely end up just gathering dust.</p><p>But the great thing about tablets, regardless of the price, is that they can solve a lot of different problems and come in a bunch of different software flavors. If you&apos;re entrenched in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem, then a Fire tablet might be better suited for your needs. Then there&apos;s Google&apos;s Pixel tablet which arrived in 2023 offering users something different with the included dock. And if you&apos;re a fan of the "stock" Android experience, this might be the perfect tablet for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-cellular-and-wi-fi-tablets-2">What is the difference between Cellular and Wi-Fi tablets</h2>
<p>Most of the time, there are no major differences when purchasing a tablet with cellular service compared to a Wi-Fi version. In some instances, there might be a slight weight difference, along with the addition of a SIM card slot, but the overall design and functionality will remain the same.</p><p>Instead, the difference between these tablets comes down to whether you want to have an "always-connected" device, or if you&apos;re fine relying on Wi-Fi connections. The former allows you to have a constant internet connection but comes at the cost of an additional line of data (read: higher monthly bill). Cellular tablets also have a tendency to suffer a bit in the battery life department since they&apos;re always trying to find a suitable network connection.</p><p>As for Wi-Fi tablets, you might not think that there&apos;s much of a cost to consider, but something to keep in mind is when you want to use the tablet and aren&apos;t within range of a Wi-Fi network. In that case, you&apos;ll need to use your phone&apos;s built-in portable hotspot, but that&apos;s not a feature immediately available on every cell phone plan. Going this route will also result in your phone&apos;s battery draining much quicker than normal, along with potentially eating up your mobile data allotment.</p>
