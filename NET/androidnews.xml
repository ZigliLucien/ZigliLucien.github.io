<h2 id="what-is-prime-big-deal-days-2">What is Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>
<p>Set to kick off on October 8th and run for 48 hours, Amazon&apos;s Big Deal Days is basically an autumnal Prime Day, featuring hundreds of exclusive deals for anyone who has a Prime membership. </p><p>Everything from smartphones and laptops to clothing and kitchen appliances is expected to go on sale, so now would be a good time to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for Prime</strong></a> if you haven&apos;t yet. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-next-prime-day-2">When is the next Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Although it&apos;s not <em>technically </em>Prime Day, Amazon&apos;s 48-hour Big Deal Days sale is essentially the same thing and it&apos;s set to kick off on October 8th. </p><p>If you&apos;re looking for the next <em>official </em>Prime Day, you can probably expect that sale to go live sometime in mid-July 2025. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-member-to-get-the-deals-2">Do I have to be a member to get the deals?</h2>
<p>Yep. Just like Amazon&apos;s regular Prime Day sale event in July, the vast majority of deals during Big Deal Days will only be available to Prime members. Fortunately, if you don&apos;t want to pay, you could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> and enjoy access to all of the best deals without paying a dime. </p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out an update to passkeys that lets users save and sync those important credentials across devices.</li><li>This will remove the need to scan a QR code when attempting to sign in outside of Android; however, a new PIN has been added for E2EE protection.</li><li>Users can save and sync their passkeys on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux, while ChromeOS support is in beta testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest update to passkeys brings some much-needed convenience to an important safety measure.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-password-manager-passkeys-update-september-2024/">Keyword post</a>, users can save passkeys in Google&apos;s Password Manager across Windows, MacOS, and Linux devices through the Chrome browser. It&apos;ll also come to Chromebooks, as the feature is currently in beta for ChromeOS.</p><p>Saving passkeys brings some refreshing convenience. When signing in, users only need to provide their "Touch ID" (fingerprint) before gaining access. Before, they couldn&apos;t save <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-next-major-phase-of-passkey">passkeys</a> on other devices outside of Android, so they&apos;d have to scan a QR code using their phone.</p><p>This update should make things faster and more secure as Google detailed another update.</p><p>The company is rolling out a new security measure with this update dubbed "Password Manager PIN." Before users can access their passkeys on new devices, they must use their PIN to authenticate their identity. The PIN is end-to-end encrypted, so only you have access to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Vivo's next V40e mid-range phone is coming soon, likely at the end of this month.</li><li>The device is expected to ship with Dimensity 7300 and Android 14 out of the box.</li><li>Vivo confirms the device's battery and cameras, amongst other notable specs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After the recent launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-vivo-v40-series-now-flaunts-the-zeiss-camera-branding-on-both-models">Vivo V40 series</a>, the company seems to be gearing up for yet another mid-range phone launch under the same series, starting with the Indian market. </p><p>The phone is dubbed Vivo V40e, and the new website listing hints that it is coming soon. Meanwhile, some of the upcoming phone&apos;s specs have already been confirmed; another leak indicates the full specs of the V40e.</p>
<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vivo.com/in/activity/v40e-launch">per the listing</a>, the device has an updated design over the predecessor Vivo V30e, with a new camera visor at the back and color variants in Mint Green and Royal Bronze. Further, it should feel light in hand, weighing around 183 grams.</p><p>The device will feature a 6.77-inch screen (which appears curved on the edges) with 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rates. Keeping the lights on is a 5500mAh battery capacity that further comes with 80W fast charging support.</p>

<p>For optics, the revamped camera visor features ZEISS-powered dual cameras: a 50MP primary camera and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera. There&apos;s also a 50MP sensor on the front for selfies. </p><p>Per the listing, the company is firmly emphasizing its portrait camera capabilities, as the device is believed to capture 2x professional portrait mode. Additionally, the main camera supports 4K video capture with OIS+EIS.</p>

<p>While the company has confirmed these specs, tipster Yogesh Brar on X noted some other notable parameters, including a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 SoC, a shift from Qualcomm wherein the V30e came with Snapdragon 6 Gen 1. Besides, we can expect 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of RAM. The device is further expected to ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based FunTouch OS.</p><p>Lastly, it is aimed at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range segment</a> priced around Rs 20,000 to 30,000, roughly between $240 and $360. Per the tipster, the launch should be around the last week of this month, similar to last year&apos;s model.</p>

<hr>
<p>A court in Texas ruled that Samsung&apos;s devices have used wireless charging tech based on infringed patents and ordered the company to pay a fine of over $192 million.</p><p>The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled against Samsung, stating it violated five of Mojo Mobility&apos;s wireless charging patents, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/samsung-hit-with-192-mln-us-patent-verdict-over-wireless-chargers-2024-09-16/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports.</p><p>Mojo Mobility sued Samsung in 2022, claiming the tech giant used its patented <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">wireless charging tech</a> without permission.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Afshin Partovi, the inventor of the wireless charging tech, and other key Mojo Mobility members made several trips to Samsung’s headquarters in South Korea in 2013 to discuss a possible licensing deal for their technology.</p><p>However, the negotiation fell through, and Samsung went ahead and used Mojo Mobility&apos;s patented tech in its wireless charging systems, rolling it out across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a>, smartwatches, and earbuds—all without a proper license.</p><p>Because Samsung’s infringement was found to be intentional, the judge could potentially triple the damages. Despite this, Samsung claims the patents are invalid and even sued Mojo Mobility in 2023 to overturn them, but that attempt failed.</p><p>In the initial trial held in January, the jury ruled that Samsung had to pay $67.5 million in damages, plus a recurring royalty of $1.50 for each Galaxy phone that infringes Mojo Mobility’s patents.</p><p>However, the judge found the initial trial&apos;s outcome unreliable because the jury seemed confused about "running royalties" versus "lump-sum royalties," as reported by The Global Legal Post, leading to a new trial being ordered.</p><p>If Samsung doesn&apos;t pay the fine from the legal battle, many of its devices could lose wireless charging capability.</p><p>It&apos;s perhaps worth noting that Samsung was hit with a $142 million <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gkpldydydpb/SAMSUNG%20PATENT%20TRIAL%20verdict.pdf" target="_blank">judgment</a> in a separate 5G patent infringement case in the same East Texas court back in April.</p>

<ul><li>The recent Android 15 QPR beta holds clues about an upcoming "sync notification" feature for devices.</li><li>The beta didn't go into detail; however, the feature could help users keep tabs on important alerts no matter the device in use.</li><li>Google has other updates coming for notifications like a new "compact" option and a "cooldown" option for repetitive buzzes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A future Android feature drop may hold the arrival of a notification feature we&apos;ve long hoped for.</p><p>While looking through the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR beta</a>, Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sync-notifications-android-devices-leak-3481920/">Android Authority</a>) discovered a "sync across devices" function. It&apos;s unclear whether Google will roll this out to <em>all </em>Android devices—although there&apos;s hope. Regardless, Rahman suspects this "sync" will arrive for notifications due to the code spotted within the Settings menu.</p><p>The post notes a "com.android.settings.notification.syncacrossdevices" string in the QPR1 Beta 2&apos;s Settings.</p><p>Whenever this rolls out, it seems Google will offer the "sync" button alongside the sensitive notification option and a new "cooldown" button. Additionally, Rahman claims that the code&apos;s exclusion of "com.google.android" suggests this sync feature could arrive for all Android devices.</p><p>This way, if you cancel an unimportant notification on your Android phone, you won&apos;t have to do so again on your Android tablet or other devices; since they&apos;re synced, it&apos;ll be dismissed everywhere.</p><p>Google is likely still in development for the feature considering the beta didn&apos;t offer much insight into its functionality. Moreover, whenever this arrives, users can keep tabs on their important notifications no matter which device they&apos;re using.</p>

<p>It seems Google has a lot in store for notifications with Android 15 as that "cooldown" feature was first spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-notification-cooldown">Developer Preview 1</a>. The feature will seemingly reduce the frequency and repetitiveness of certain notifications on our devices. The early discovery showed that Google could give users agency over how the feature works, like whether it&apos;ll limit conversations or all notifications.</p><p>The audio cue of these notifications on cooldown will drop, though it doesn&apos;t seem like they&apos;ll go completely silent.</p><p>Toward the end of Android 15&apos;s beta, the development of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-compact-notification-layout-discovered">less disruptive, more compact</a> variant was spotted. If the "compact" version is desired, notifications will appear as a single line of text with a quick "reply" button, and the app&apos;s logo. Users can tap the dropdown menu to see the message in full.</p><p>While the customization option seemed relatively put together, speculation suggests it might not arrive for Android 15&apos;s stable launch. If not, perhaps we have the December feature drop to look forward to.</p><p>The notification sync feature was spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a>, which rolled out to enrolled testers last week. It was a hefty patch, packed with loads of Pixel Bluetooth and system fixes. More importantly, it held some insight into a few upcoming features like a redesign for the Quick Settings menu.</p><p>Android 15 is rumored to arrive for devices in October.</p>

Once again, Mint Mobile has you covered with a truly outstanding offer — <em>if</em> you&apos;re looking for a new wireless carrier.</p><p>It works like this. Order the new Google Pixel 9 alongside any six-month data plan at Mint and the T-Mobile-owned carrier will hook you up with with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>$400 discount AND six additional months of wireless</strong></a> coverage for free. That&apos;s like getting 50% off both a new phone and an entire year of wireless coverage. I&apos;d like to see Amazon&apos;s big sale top that (spoiler alert: it won&apos;t). </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 was just released on August 22nd, but you can already score a whopping $400 discount AND six months of free wireless coverage when you bundle the purchase of the phone with any six-month data plan at Mint. It's easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">best Google Pixel 9 deals</a> I've seen since the phone was first unveiled earlier this month, but don't expect it to be around for long. </p>
<p>Need more size? It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/6810506/"><strong>Mint has dropped an identical offer on the larger Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</strong></a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1e720f4-a69c-4b11-a3c4-1d3c933b3e09" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Thanks to this deal, you can get Google&apos;s latest flagship phone alongside an <em>entire year</em> of T-Mobile-powered wireless for as little as $489 when you pay upfront (or $21 per month if you use affirm). Even if you sign up for Mint&apos;s most-expensive Unlimited plan, you&apos;re still looking at a max upfront payment of $579. That&apos;s over $200 less than you&apos;d pay if you bought the unlocked Pixel 9 by itself, and that&apos;s not even considering the value of covering your phone bill for a year. </p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> in the biz, Mint Mobile isn&apos;t a slouch when it comes to coverage either. Owned and operated by T-Mobile (and famously endorsed by Ryan Reynolds), Mint operates with a simple buy-in-bulk plan system that gives you access to the world&apos;s largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and calls to Mexico and Canada. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, on the other hand, comes packed with Google&apos;s latest AI-powered technology, excellent cameras, and the efficiency of the Tensor G4 chipset. You also get seven years of OS updates guaranteed, which means you could be using this phone long after you say goodbye to Mint (if you decide to do so).</p>

<p><em>Now that you&apos;ve saved some serious cash on a great new device, take a few of those dollars and invest in one of the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases"><em>best Google Pixel 9 cases</em></a><em>. </em></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>We now have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">phones that fold</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">phones that fold <em>twice</em></a>, and if the rumor mill is right we&apos;ll soon have phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">with roll-out screens</a> like a trundle bed. For now, these are devices with a low adoption rate and high price tags. They&apos;re not something most people are looking to buy.</p><p>One day that&apos;s going to change. Maybe not soon, but eventually, it will become normal to have a phone that flips open or rolls out. When that happens, one of two things also needs to happen: either someone has to invent a phone display that doesn&apos;t tear, or the warranty has to get a lot better.</p>
<p>The screen on your phone is like a sandwich. Layers of glass and circuitry are used to build a screen that can show you what you want to see and know when and where you touched it. The concept of how they work isn&apos;t difficult to understand even if building one correctly is.</p><p>When you add movement into the mix a lot has to adapt. Some layers in a display were already flexible, others only needed a small material change, while others like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-video-shows-ultra-thin-glass-tested">the glass</a> needed something brand new. We got there and there are plenty of phones that can fold or flip.</p>
<p>What many people don&apos;t think about is how this affects the individual layers of the screen. We&apos;ve all seen a broken phone screen, and often, under the busted glass, there may be a big dark splotch that resembles spilled ink or weird technicolor lines on the parts of the display that still work. These are the other components in the display sandwich that broke or were torn after the physical damage to the glass happened. These layers are so fragile that glass is used to protect them.</p><p>This is compounded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-display-damage-reports">with foldable phones</a>. There are a lot of people who have seen a photo of a foldable screen that&apos;s blacked out or looks torn, especially around the crease itself. You don&apos;t have to break the glass for this to happen because you&apos;re flexing all the layers of the sandwich, hoping that nothing fails.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">If it happened to you</a>, it&apos;s even worse because getting a company to stand behind <em>everything</em> also means a timely repair and that doesn&apos;t always happen. It happens more to phones with screens that move so companies making them need to offer better support options.</p><p>I&apos;m lucky. In all the years I&apos;ve done this for a living and all the devices that have moved across my desk, I&apos;ve only had to file a warranty claim twice. Both times, everything went off without a hitch. If you&apos;re curious, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tabpro-and-notepro-review">Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2</a> had a screen defect, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review-iphone-users-perspective">Pixel 4</a> had a bulging battery. Both Samsung and Google promptly sent out a replacement and asked me to return the defective product.</p>
<p>This is because both products had problems that shouldn&apos;t have happened. Using that logic means a phone with a screen that can bend shouldn&apos;t have a defect or break unless you did something to cause it. The way things work now is that the warranty is decided by time, not usage.</p><p>If you baby your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/atandt-says-its-skipping-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and are always extra careful to never fold it while something could enter the hinge, you&apos;re only covered for a certain amount of time. If it breaks before the date Google stops covering it, you file a warranty claim. If it breaks the day after, you pay a hefty repair bill or buy a new phone.</p>
<p>That&apos;s how things work now and I get it — Snap On can offer a lifetime warranty on a wrench but Google or any other phone maker can&apos;t do the same for a phone that wasn&apos;t designed to last forever. But the warranty period on a phone screen that&apos;s more likely to break and one that&apos;s not can&apos;t be the same. It&apos;s simply not fair to us.</p><p>The way foldable phones are built gets better each generation, and maybe this won&apos;t be something we need to worry about soon. Some manufacturers also have a special warranty for foldable phones, and that shows you realize the need to differentiate. I know that when the majority of phones have flexible screens, we&apos;re going to see a lot more of them breaking. I hope this doesn&apos;t mean we see a lot more people out of luck because of it.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> has been one of the better alternatives to ChatGPT and other similar AI assistants. However, Android users will have an extra edge with Gemini since they already use most other Google services. Gemini is now integrating some of them on the web.</p><p>The search giant is now adding Google Keep and Google Tasks extensions to Gemini on the web client, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/17/google-tasks-keep-gemini-extensions/">9to5Google</a>. Users can easily access the extensions by typing <strong>@Google Keep</strong> or <strong>@Google Tasks</strong> on the search bar. They can create notes and lists, add items to current lists, or find stuff from them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:927px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.72%;"><img id="H2Ldpg6B3B28JfhuLv2f3L" name="google-keep-extension-on-gemini.jpg" alt="Google Keep and Tasks extensions on Gemini web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H2Ldpg6B3B28JfhuLv2f3L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="927" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, they can ask Gemini to perform their tasks using stored notes in the Google Keep app. Some of the examples shared by the search giant on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15230597?sjid=3085362898266051411-AP">Gemini Apps Help page</a> include:</p>
<ul><li>Create a note called [note name]</li><li>Create a list called [list name] with [item 1, item 2, …]</li></ul>
<p>Similarly, for Google Tasks, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15230285?sjid=3085362898266051411-AP">support page</a> shared a few prompts that users can get along with:</p>
<ul><li>Remind me on [date] at [time] to [task].</li><li>Remind me at [time] to call [name].</li><li>Add [task] in my to-dos.</li></ul>
<p>Users can review what these new extensions can do on the support pages. There are some actions that these extensions cannot perform. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Modify a note</li><li>Delete notes and lists</li><li>Share notes and lists</li><li>View images and drawings</li><li>Add an image</li></ul>
<p>These are additions to the other Google Workspace extensions, which include Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, and Google Drive. Summarizing emails is one of the most used activities in Gemini support. It appears these new extensions&apos; support should make organizing and keeping notes a lot easier for Android phone users.</p><p>In other news, Gemini Live, the AI tool for natural conversations, has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">made free to all users</a>, a privilege previously reserved for Gemini Advanced subscribers.</p>

<ul><li>Earlier this summer, reports indicated that Google could be vying for Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica. </li><li>Now, EssilorLuxottica announced that it has reached a long-term deal with Meta to partner and collaborate ”into the next decade.”</li><li>EssilorLuxottica owns the Ray-Ban brand, which helped make the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are incredibly successful.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta’s collaboration with EssilorLuxottica led to the creation of<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review"> Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, which are the abundantly-successful successor to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a>. Now, that partnership will continue ”into the next decade,” the storied eyewear brand announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/essilorluxottica-and-meta-announce-long-term-partnership/" target="_blank">press release</a> Tuesday, Sept. 17. </p><p>The news comes after Google reportedly tried, and subsequently failed, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/there-could-be-a-bidding-war-for-smart-glasses-meta-might-win">strike a deal of its own with EssilorLuxottica</a>. </p><p>Following the positive reception to Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which have gotten better over time thanks to over-the-air software updates, Meta and EssilorLuxottica want to team up for the foreseeable future. EssilorLuxottica is a massive Italian-French multinational corporation with many recognizable brands under its umbrella, including Ray-Ban. The company says Ray-Ban Meta glasses are “in high demand in the markets they’re available in,” which has been evidenced by low stock online and in Lens Crafters retail stores.</p><p>“I&apos;m proud of the work we&apos;ve done with EssilorLuxottica so far, and I&apos;m excited about our long term roadmap ahead,” said Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, in a statement. “We have the opportunity to turn glasses into the next major technology platform, and make it fashionable in the process." </p><p>Although the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are Meta’s only current smart eyewear product, there appear to be many more in the pipeline. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ar-glasses-tease-feb">Zuckerberg teased the existence of new AR smart glasses</a> earlier this year, and we may learn more about them soon. There’s also the Meta Quest family of VR/AR headsets, which could eventually be scaled down to the glasses form factor in the future.</p>

<p>We always make a point to never buy something expecting it to get better over time with future software updates, and simply be surprised if it does. Well, that’s exactly what Meta did with the Ray-Ban Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. They first shipped with a camera, speakers, and relatively basic voice assistant functionality. In April 2024, they received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">an update with Meta AI and video calling support</a>.</p><p>Through all the hype around the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1 — and even Google’s Project Astra and OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4o — it was Meta who delivered a consumer-friendly way to tap into multimodal AI without breaking the bank. Your glasses saw what you could see, and was able to tell you more about it. There is no wildly-overpriced dedicated AI hardware required. Delivering multimodal AI to a person’s face with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses is arguably one of Meta’s biggest achievements in the wearable space. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, what matters is that the Ray-Ban Metas are the first pair of smart glasses that really sold. We know what EssilorLuxottica vaguely said about sales, but anecdotal evidence supports that point as well. After nearly a year of wearing Ray-Ban Meta glasses as my daily drivers, as well as competitors like the Solos AirGo 3 and the TCL RayNeoAir 2, the Ray-Ban Metas are the only one that is regularly recognized in the wild. </p><p>I’m not talking about by people in tech circles, either. I wore the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/solos-airgo-vision-launch">Solos AirGo 3</a> for a few hours at Google I/O and it took my Android Central colleagues a fair bit of time to figure out that they were smart glasses. By comparison, I’ll go to a coffee shop in Arizona and get questions like “are those the Ray-Ban smart glasses with cameras?” It’s the small details like those that show when a product has reached mainstream appeal, and that is a significant hurdle for many emerging products. Meta and EssilorLuxottica crossed it, and that’s why I’m not surprised they’re gearing up for a happy future. </p><p>As a glasses-wearer that needs prescription spectacles nearly 24/7 to navigate the world, I’ve had an interesting time wearing the Ray-Ban Metas. They’re not that comfortable, battery life is mediocre, and <em>everyone</em> can hear what you’re playing through the speakers. Then I remember that a pair of smart glasses stylish enough to pass as regular glasses can take photos like this one, straight from my face. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.40%;"><img id="cxVn8QXTuZcxohoAVHXn4k" name="IMG_0529.jpeg" alt="I took this photo of Frigate Bay, St. Kitts with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cxVn8QXTuZcxohoAVHXn4k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="1921" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I took this photo of Frigate Bay, St. Kitts with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s enough for me, and many others. If you would’ve told me I could take a photo with my glasses of that quality five or 10 years ago, I would’ve laughed or scoffed. </p><p>In some ways, the fact that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are so good <em>and</em> have so much room for improvement is exciting. I already know what I want to see in a Ray-Ban Meta 2, and I’d probably buy a new pair if Meta and EssilorLuxottica fixed a few of my gripes. Durability is a big one — I fried my original pair of Ray-Ban Metas after the frame cracked without my knowledge, and some water got through the IPX4 shell. </p><p>(To be fair, I broke the Solos AirGo 3 too. The Ray-Ban Metas aren’t the first pair of glasses I’ve broken, and certainly won’t be the last.)</p><p>I’m of the belief that if Meta and EssilorLuxottica stick together, they’ll likely march towards smart eyewear dominance. With this long-term agreement, they’re one step closer to making that a reality. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Here&apos;s a scenario you may have found yourself in before. You pick up a great new phone or e-reader but you can&apos;t find any cases for it. This commonly happens when you buy something from a company that&apos;s not Samsung, Google, or Apple, and seems pretty ridiculous. But I&apos;d bet my hat that Tudia makes a case for whatever device you&apos;re about to buy.</p><p>That&apos;s one of the many reasons I love Tudia. They&apos;ve got cases for every smartphone manufacturer you can think of—even more obscure ones like Blu, Nuu, or even TCL phones—plus a bevy of other devices like Kobo and Onyx Boox e-readers, heart rate monitors, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/backbone-is-releasing-a-limited-edition-call-of-duty-controller-with-in-game-perks">Backbone Gaming controllers</a>. Not only that, but they&apos;re super affordable, coming in at a fraction of what some of the other big-name case makers cost, and Prime Day on October 8, 2024, will no doubt bring a fresh wave of discounts for my new favorite cases.</p><p>Plus, unlike many other case manufacturers, Tudia&apos;s cases aren&apos;t the same boring look on every device they make. Rather, each case feels bespoke for the device, giving it a unique look and feel that does more than just protect it.</p><p>Take this Tudia case I have for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, for example. When I first put it on the phone, I couldn&apos;t believe how well it matched the phone&apos;s original styling and feel. This is the very definition of perfection in design, as it maintains an authenticity to the original phone&apos;s look while still providing excellent protection. </p>

<p>It&apos;s got the transparent back in view, ensuring the unique glyph LEDs are unobstructed, and even displays the prominent, darker side rails in a way that feels authentic to the original style. The company makes this style of case for all of Nothing&apos;s excellent phones, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-Nothing-Phone-Anti-Yellowing-Semi-Transparent/dp/B0CZ3SGFRQ/">Phone 2a and 2a Plus</a>.</p><p>Unlike a bunch of other case manufacturers, Tudia&apos;s case prices are incredibly reasonable. I&apos;m talking around $20 for a case—and often less than that—plus coupons and Prime Day discounts for when Prime Day begins on October 8, 2024.</p><p>I also love that Tudia makes cases for even the most niche devices. I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> e-reader and would confidently call it the best e-reader ever, but finding reasonably priced cases for it, especially in the first few months after release, was surprisingly difficult.</p><p>Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-Reinforced-Anti-Yellowing-Transparent-Lightweight/dp/B0D2QCN22C">Tudia&apos;s Boox Palma case</a> not only comes in a range of colors and styles but is also <em>super</em> lightweight. That&apos;s incredibly important for an e-reader, as those devices are designed to be light and easy to hold for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Lightweight doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s not protective. In fact, I&apos;d trust this case over the official Boox case if for no other reason than that Tudia&apos;s case includes padded corners and more protective sides made of squishier TPU.</p><p>On my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>, Tudia&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-DualShield-MergeGrip-Shockproof-Protective/dp/B0D78NB5C8/">DualShield case</a> feels supremely sturdy in a way most cases wish they could, all without feeling like one of those obnoxious bulky cases you may have used before. Better yet, it&apos;s normally only $25, making it less than half the price of other well-built cases all while feeling better designed and made.</p><p>This one even comes in the phone&apos;s original colors, including that lovely Jade Green. Many of the company&apos;s other cases, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-MergeGrip-Military-Shockproof-Protective/dp/B0CSFLGW13">like this one</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, even feature unique phone elements like OnePlus&apos;s camera island design. Again, all of these things make the phone you&apos;re using look more like <em>that</em> phone and not just another generic phone in a case.</p>

<p>And oh my gosh is this case ever grippy! Those raised dots on the back give it a lovely texture that&apos;s fun to rub a fingernail over when feeling fidgety.</p><p>Tudia often puts MagSafe rings inside these types of cases, too, giving you the ability to use your Android phone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best MagSafe accessories</a> like car chargers and magnetic wallets. So even if your phone isn&apos;t Qi2 ready, you can make it so that it uses Magnetic wireless chargers anyway.</p><p>Even if Tudia&apos;s designs are your thing, Prime Day will undoubtedly bring along some incredible deals on the phone case you&apos;ve been waiting to pick up, and it&apos;s just around the corner, too. Mark your calendars for October 8!</p>
