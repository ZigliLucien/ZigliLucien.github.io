                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>We&apos;re just a few days away from seeing the newest lineup of Galaxy devices, but you actually don&apos;t have to wait for Unpacked 2024 to score a Samsung deal today. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w"><strong>Fill out this form</strong></a> with your first name, last name, and email address to reserve a preorder and Samsung will hook you up with a <strong>$50 credit</strong> straight out of the gate. You&apos;ll also be eligible to receive up to <strong>$1,500 of trade-in credit</strong> once the devices go live on July 10th, plus you&apos;ll be entered into a sweepstakes to win $5,000. If predictions are correct, Samsung is expected to reveal the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 during the event, but this deal can be applied to any of the new devices. </p><p>There&apos;s no obligation to buy if you change your mind later, and you can always remove yourself from Samsung&apos;s email list if you&apos;re no longer interested after the event on July 10th. There&apos;s no such thing as free money, but with the Galaxy Reserve program, you&apos;re coming pretty darn close. </p>

<p>A bunch of new Samsung devices are set to be unveiled on July 10th, but if you reserve your place in line today, you'll receive an exclusive $50 credit. You'll also be eligible to receive up to $1,500 of trade-in credit once the mystery devices go live, <em>and </em>you'll be entered into a sweepstakes to win an additional $5,000 of Samsung credit. </p>
<p>There's no obligation to buy, no payment required today, and you only need to provide your name and email address. Just keep in mind that the offer expires once Samsung Unpacked starts on July 10th, so don't wait much longer!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w " target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="78a37c78-9b80-4241-bf28-739453184fd4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Reserve your Galaxy preorder and get $50 of credit, up to $1,500 of trade-in credit, and more" data-dimension48="Reserve your Galaxy preorder and get $50 of credit, up to $1,500 of trade-in credit, and more">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>So what new devices do we expect to see during Samsung Unpacked on July 10th? Well, nothing has been confirmed, but a large number of leaks and rumors have suggested that we might get a first look at the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a> foldable phones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 series</a>, and, if we&apos;re lucky, the highly-anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>. </p><p>Filling out the form above will give you $50 to apply to any of the aforementioned Galaxy devices, assuming we&apos;re correct about the stuff that&apos;s revealed. You&apos;ll obviously lose the credit if you decide not to preorder after the event, but there&apos;s no real pressure from Samsung beyond that. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-samsung-unpacked-2">When is Samsung Unpacked?</h2>
<p>Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked event is scheduled for Wednesday, July 10th at 9am EST / 6am PDT / 2pm BST in Paris, France.

<p>Most of the smart home devices currently on sale at Amazon support the Alexa platform, so if you use Google Home or any other personal assistant, you may want to wait until Prime Day to see what other offers will go live during the event. It&apos;s also worth noting that most of the following deals require a Prime membership, so if you haven&apos;t joined up yet, it may be a good time to consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>signing up for the 30-day Amazon Prime free trial</strong></a> so you don&apos;t miss out on any of the action.  </p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re only a couple of days away from Unpacked, and the pricing of Samsung&apos;s next wave of earbuds has leaked.</p><p>The alleged pricing of the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were detailed by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Kuma_Sleepy/status/1809656482553868693">Kuma_Sleepy</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-3-pro-price-leaks-south-korea/">SamMobile</a>). From the screenshot, which is from a South Korean retailer, the base Buds 3 will seemingly hit the shelves at 203,700 KRW (~$147). The higher-end Pro variant features a 296,700 KRW (~$214) price tag.</p><p>With that, the early retail listing also gives one final look at the Galaxy Buds 3 series&apos; design changes we&apos;ve seen rumored quite often. While Samsung has moved away from the bulbous look of the Buds (along with that wingtip), the base model is devoid of a silicon ear tip.</p><p>Samsung seems poised to save that little addition for the Pro variant — and let&apos;s not forget about the new stem design, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-apple-like-redesign-leak">which feels like Apple&apos;s AirPods</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that these assumed price points for the Galaxy Buds 3 series are close to the Buds 2 series. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a> launched at $229 in 2022, while the base version went for $149.</p><p>If these prices are the real deal, it could be good news for interested consumers. However, it&apos;s always worth remembering that price conversions aren&apos;t always 1:1, meaning Samsung will likely make pricing adjustments based on the region.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">정말 버즈 3, 버즈 3 프로가 이 가격에 나온다면 차라리 할인 할 때 까지 기다릴 듯 pic.twitter.com/UbNkWeAFvw<a href="https://twitter.com/Kuma_Sleepy/status/1809656482553868693">July 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With anticipation building, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro was recently spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-real-life-images-leak">a few real-life images</a> alongside the revamped case. Not only did the images confirm the existence of a new stem design for the Buds 3 series, but the charging case offers a metallic finish with a clear dome. The person who obtained the device and posted the pictures stated they were able to connect them to a Galaxy Z Flip 4 and an iPhone.</p><p>Other discoveries in the Samsung Members app suggested that the stem <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-stem-design-to-feature-pinch-controls">will offer playback controls</a>. The app&apos;s code showed that consumers would have "pinch" controls for the stems, enabling control over calls, media, and more. This will be quite a change, considering the previous Buds only offered swipe and tap gestures for controls.</p><p>The good news is Samsung is preparing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">reveal its next wave of Galaxy devices</a> on July 10 in Paris, France at 9 am EDT.</p>

Discovered through its experimental Chrome Canary build, the Safety Check v2 build shows Google&apos;s plans for the feature to run "regularly" in the background.</p><p>The purpose of it will be to check your device&apos;s browser for safety/security irregularities. According to the experimental build&apos;s description, this involves Chrome on Android&apos;s settings as the check "ensures" you&apos;re running the safest options.</p><p>Version 2 of Safety Check also expands what it monitors and alerts users to. The test build shows new options for Chrome&apos;s updates, permissions, notifications, and the Safe Browsing collection of settings. If any of these changes are made, Chrome&apos;s safety alerts for Android users will be produced so they can get things back in line.</p><p>The upcoming Safety Check update will prominently display if a user has any compromised passwords. A convenient button to hop into your Password Manager is likely there as a quick way of changing those credentials for your safety.</p>

<p>While it looks like Google is nearly done with developing Safety Check&apos;s next upgrades, there&apos;s no clear indication of when users can expect its rollout.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-android-biometric-unlock-incognito-tabs">updated Safety Check</a> for desktops earlier this year, which brought "personalized" recommendations. Users were given details about previously granted permissions so they could revisit them and make changes if necessary. Alongside that, the PC update was one for Android&apos;s Incognito tabs. Users gained biometric authentication so they could lock those tabs when closing the browser.</p><p>It was a feature iOS users had already, and now Android users can utilize it.</p><p>Google has another feature for its Chrome Android users, which involves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-for-android-to-get-read-aloud-feature">an offline version</a> of the Read Aloud feature. Tucked behind a hidden flag, Google&apos;s code showed plans for users to have the browser read articles to them without an internet connection. The feature was given the codename "Read Aloud Background Playback" within the strings.</p>

<hr>
<p>As the busy tech summer gets underway, hype continues to build for Google&apos;s next smartwatch, which is going through its FCC hoops.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/07/pixel-watch-3-fcc/">9to5Google</a>, the FCC listing for Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel Watch 3 showcases a few notable improvements over last year&apos;s. First, the publication notes that the FCC currently displays four model names for the assumed next-gen Pixel Watch: GBDU9, GG3HH, GRY0E, and GGE4J.</p><p>The apparent inclusion of UWB support for the Pixel Watch 3 leads off the upgrades. This is a feature that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> previously missed out on, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">rumors at the time</a> suggesting it would. Additionally, the listing highlights that the Wear OS addition sports 5GHz Wi-Fi.</p><p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that the 2023 model only offered 2.3GHz Wi-Fi.</p><p>Model numbers GBDU9 and GRY0E stand out due to LTE support, while the remaining two devices only offer Bluetooth/Wi-Fi. The FCC lacks any information regarding Pixel Watch 3 size variants. However, the publication suspects Google could follow a similar trend and debut its watches between the 41mm and 45mm range.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="wTquEhgungrWbNJr9n4oLC" name="google-pixel-watch-2-review-21x9.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTquEhgungrWbNJr9n4oLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the listing touted as the Pixel Watch 3, the existence of UWB gives strong callbacks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-plans-to-give-watch-unlock-a-boost-with-ultra-wideband-tech">discovery from March</a>. Strings of code in the Play Services app highlighted Google&apos;s work to bring UWB support to its Pixel-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-use-wear-os-watch-unlock">Watch Unlock</a> feature. Currently, the feature piggybacks off the watch and your phone&apos;s Bluetooth signal to unlock the device.</p><p>Unfortunately, this method produces a so-so experience, often feeling more fickle than dependable. A UWB chip packed into the Pixel Watch 3 was assumed a few months ago and this FCC listing almost seals the deal.</p><p>A set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">alleged Pixel Watch 3 renderings</a> surfaced recently, which purport a slightly thicker device. The Assistant triggering button was still seen, alongside its circular, glass-domed face, and a rotating crown. The running theory is that the thicker size is due to the possibility of a larger Pixel Watch battery. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-battery-certification-spotted">the rumors</a> aren&apos;t <em>that </em>exciting as the device could see a minimal 307mAh battery instead of 306mAh.</p><p>We won&apos;t have to wait long for Google as the company started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">emailing and teasing</a> an earlier hardware event on August 13. The company is expected to debut its next Pixel 9 series, the Pixel Watch 3, and the successor to the Pixel Fold.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Motorola quietly added a new support document for “What’s new in Android 14,” signaling the update’s imminent release.</li><li>Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 users have started to see Android 14 appear on their devices, though not all device owners have received the update.</li><li>Android 14 comes to Motorola’s foldables from 2023 about a year after they were first introduced, and just days after the new Razr phones were revealed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola recently unveiled its next-generation foldables, which are set to launch this month: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">the Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024</a>. Those devices will launch with Android 14, but when Motorola showed them off, the current-gen Razr Plus 2023 and Razr 2023 were still stuck on Android 13. The company is finally changing that, as the Android 14 update is rolling out for some Razr owners about a year after their phones were first released.</p><p>Several users have seen the Android 14 update appear on their Razr Plus or Razr phones over the last few days, but it isn’t hitting all devices right now (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/motorola-razr-2023-finally-received-android-14-update/" target="_blank">YTechB</a> also noticed that Motorola quietly published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.motorola.com/hc/5508/14/global/en-us/?t=CG0608830866" target="_blank">support document</a> explaining what’s new in Android 14 for the Razr 40 Ultra. That’s what the Razr Plus is called outside of North America. </p><p>“Better late than never” is one way to look at Motorola’s slow pace of supporting Android 14 on the Razr Plus and Razr. Another viewpoint might be that the lack of urgency in updating Motorola’s flagship foldable is just another reason why the company’s software support shouldn’t be trusted. Android Central editor Derrek Lee has been using the Razr Plus 2023 as a daily driver for the better part of the last year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">it has been a bit of a mixed bag</a>. Software support, particularly for Android 14 but also for the Gemini app, is a key negative to using the Razr Plus 2023. </p><p>Now that the Android 14 update is rolling out to the 2023 lineup of Motorola foldables, it feels like a wrong has been righted. But at the same time, I’m not sure this excuses Motorola’s poor rollout pace for the upgrade. For reference, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023 got the Android 14 update before the Razr Plus 2023, and the former phone is a budget device that retailed for $400. What’s the point of paying for premium Motorola phones if those customers aren’t prioritized? </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr/comments/1duszym/i_finally_got_the_android_14_update_on_my_razr">I finally got the Android 14 update on my RAZR after several months of waiting 🥲🙌🏽</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr">r/razr</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Motorola promises that the Razr Plus 2023 will get three years of full OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security patches. The company ticks off the first OS upgrade of that promise with Android 14, and it can still uphold its end of the bargain. However, I’m not sure if this is what Razr owners pictured when they purchased their smartphone. </p><p>Razr phones are already in a weird spot since they were introduced in the summer months, and most of us are already looking ahead to the next Android update. The Razr Plus 2023 and Razr 2023 launched with Android 13, and Android 14 came just a few months later. This same scenario will play out for the Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024, which will launch with Android 14 a few months before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> debuts. </p><p>The predicament wouldn’t be as much of a problem if Motorola rolled out Android updates quickly. In fact, despite Samsung launching its foldables <em>after</em> Motorola, this release schedule hasn’t been a problem. It’s only an issue because Motorola takes an insanely long time to roll out Android updates. If I were a prospective Razr Plus 2024 buyer, and I thought Motorola might not give that phone Android 15 until July 2025, it would certainly factor into my purchasing decision. </p>

<p>At face value, it’s easy to rag on Motorola for not providing efficient, reliable, and extensive software support for its premium smartphones. But it’s never that simple. In its effort to bring Android 14 to its 2023 lineup of folding phones, Motorola made a lot of good choices. For starters, it decided to bring some of the new software features debuting on the Razr Plus 2024 to the current Razr Plus 2023. These features will actually be available on the current models starting now, and that’s <em>before </em>the new models become available for purchase.</p><p>The list of new features includes improved cover screen software, new panels, and better fonts. Motorola also added an always-on display and the ability to use the camera’s flash to signify unread notifications. That’s without mentioning all of the base Android 14 features that Google added to the Android Open Source Project version that Motorola’s MyUX is based on.</p><p>It’s not a given that companies will bring new software features designed for newer phones to older ones. In fact, Motorola might be better off making features exclusive to the 2024 models to make them a better value or a more appealing upgrade. Of course, the fact that they didn’t do that should be praised. There’s no technical reason why these improvements can’t run on the Razr Plus 2023, and it’s a good thing they’re being ported to that model with Android 14.</p><p>This only makes the software situation more complicated. On one hand, Motorola’s slow rollout of Android 14 should be an immediate red flag for people considering buying one of its newer phones. On the other hand, adding Razr Plus 2024 features to Razr Plus 2023 with an update is a consumer-friendly move for which Motorola deserves credit. At the end of the day, buyers need to decide whether Motorola’s updates are worth the wait because speed and longevity aren’t the company’s strengths. </p>

<hr>
<p>About a year ago, it looked like Elon Musk was driving Twitter (now X) into the ground, and rumors swirled about Meta cooking up a competitor of its own. The company seemed to have rushed the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-gains-trending-topics-in-a-move-making-it-more-like-x">Threads</a> — a text-based social media app built on the back of Instagram — to capitalize on the uncertainty surrounding X. The plan appears to have worked: Threads hit 100 million users after being available for just five days last July.</p><p>Threads launched one year ago as of July 5, and it’s continuing to grow, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says. The platform has 175 million monthly active users, he revealed in a Thread (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191074/meta-threads-users-mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p>

<p>Meta’s history of creating or operating great social media platforms certainly helped get Threads off the ground. That’s even more true because Meta decided to make Instagram and Threads accounts one and the same. It pushed Instagram users—of which there are more than two billion globally—to give Threads a try. Instagram users started seeing suggested Threads in their Instagram notifications, a clear push from Meta to get people on the new platform.</p><p>This is a common strategy employed by social media platforms. By leveraging their existing user bases, these companies can skip the excruciating process of building up the first wave of site users. We’re seeing this again with TikTok. There’s a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-notes-app-soft-launch">TikTok Notes app</a> beginning to roll out in limited testing phases for users in some countries. It’s an Instagram rival, and since TikTok is arguably the biggest social media platform on the planet right now, ByteDance is showing Notes teasers in the main TikTok.</p><p>Meta and Threads got a head start by leveraging the success of Instagram, but that shouldn’t discount how impressive the launch of Threads really was. It hit 100 million users in five days, which we’ve never seen before. If you recall, OpenAI’s ChatGPT app became the fastest-growing mobile app after it reached 100 million users in two months. Threads made one of the apps of the year (and perhaps the software of the decade) look like an amateur with its blistering launch. </p>

<p>After the launch of Threads, something interesting happened. Twitter — or X, if you like Musk’s new branding — didn’t die. Advertisers either pulled away from the platform or threatened to, and many came crawling back. Musk, either as the platform’s official CEO or now as its de-facto dictator, continued to make platform-breaking decisions. The verification system was completely destroyed, the X Premium subscriptions were prioritized, and likes were hidden. </p><p>And yet, X looks just as alive as it ever has. Musk hasn’t shared official growth or active user figures for X, so we don’t know for sure how it’s doing. But we don’t really have to. X is still culturally relevant; it’s still the place people go for breaking news in tech or politics, and it’s still the “town square” of the internet. For example, when Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI, hired by Microsoft, and then re-hired by OpenAI, it all happened on X. Threads was barely part of the conversation, and it was just catching up with what had happened an hour earlier on X. </p><p>For context, I’m not a huge fan of Musk or the changes he made to X. I don’t pay for X Premium, nor am I particularly happy about spending a ton of time on X. It’s still my most-used social media platform, both for work-related and personal reasons. X is where breaking news happens, and it’s also where the most interesting conversations happen. </p>

<h2 id="why-is-threads-still-a-thing-2">Why is Threads still a thing?</h2>
<p>So, if Threads has 175 million users, why isn’t it as lively as X? That might have something to do with Zuckerberg’s reporting of <em>monthly</em> active users. I check Threads at least once a month, usually only for a few minutes. A notification comes across my phone or appears on Instagram, so I see what it’s about. By comparison, I’m on X every single day. <em>Daily</em> active users dictate how vibrant a social media platform is, not <em>monthly</em> users. </p><p>Threads’ early success gives me hope that it can build up the number of daily users on the platform, thus increasing its liveliness. To me, the fact that it added 75 million users after an early spurt is more impressive than the quick 100 million it started with last July. Prolonged growth is what social platforms need for long-term success. And when it comes to social networks, don’t bet against Meta.</p><p>The thing is, Threads isn’t trying to be Twitter. It doesn’t really want to be the hub for breaking news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-allows-users-to-limit-quote-posts-on-the-app-and-web">controversy</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-approach-to-political-content-on-instagram-and-threads" target="_blank">politics</a>. Without sounding too reductive, Threads is looking for more wholesome content. When I go on Threads, I see cool desk setups, scenic views, and generally uplifting content. When I load up X, I want to pull my hair out due to the engagement bait, awful or misleading takes, and generally negative content on the platform. </p><p>Maybe that’s why Threads is still growing. I may be addicted to using X, but it’s not a generally enjoyable experience. Threads, on the other hand, are mostly positive. People looking for the antithesis of X now have Threads, and 175 million users seem to like the difference in direction.</p>

<hr>
<p>Last week, a massive leak uncovered nearly everything about Samsung’s upcoming foldables — the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 — which will be officially announced at a Galaxy Unpacked event on July 10. The leak featured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-galaxy-z-flip-6-full-specs-leak">official marketing images and press materials</a>, leaving little to the imagination. One change is so small that you might have missed it, and yet it could have the most impact of any change Samsung is making this year. </p><p>It’s no secret that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">folding phones</a> have had a durability problem since day one. Samsung’s first Galaxy Z Fold device broke into the hands of reviewers before the phone became fully available for consumers. Subsequent versions of the Z Fold 2, Z Fold 3, and Z Flip were better but still had serious durability concerns. It wasn’t until the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 that Samsung seemed to really perfect the folding phone design. </p><p>In the beginning, foldables were brittle, lacked water resistance, and featured weak screens. Eventually, Samsung added water resistance with an IPX8 certification on more recent models. Those folding phones still lacked dust resistance, making them susceptible to durability problems over time. It’s not an issue exclusive to Samsung, either. Motorola’s foldables are the only ones in North America to feature dust resistance, but they aren’t water-resistant beyond IPX2, so there’s a trade-off. </p><p>If the latest leaks are to be believed, Samsung is about to shake things up by revealing foldables that are both dust-resistant and water-resistant. It reportedly comes with an IP48 rating, which will give it some degree of protection from both dust and water ingress.</p>

<p>IP ratings can be understood by looking at the first and second numbers separately. The first number represents a device’s dust-resistance rating, and the second represents its water-resistance rating. Because prior Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip devices had an IPX8 certification, they didn’t have dust resistance at all. For what it’s worth, the ‘8’ is the highest level of water resistance. This means that a device can withstand being submerged in a few meters of water for at least 30 minutes. </p><p>Water resistance is always important on smartphones since they’re with you pretty much all the time. However, on folding phones, dust resistance is arguably the more important IP rating. There are real points of entry for dust and debris due to the hinge mechanism, as well as more moving parts than a traditional smartphone. All it takes is for one piece of dust to get in the hinge or under the display to cause a whole lot of damage. </p><p>The rumored IP48 rating featured on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 means that large bits of dust won’t interfere with the operation of the phones. It’s not completely dustproof — that would be IP6X — but it’s a considerable improvement. Larger objects, like those 1mm or greater, won’t be able to get into Samsung‘s new folding phones. There is still work to do when it comes to dust resistance, but this IP rating might significantly improve the durability of Samsung foldables.</p>

<p>I’m an early adopter of foldables. I’ve used four different folding phones over the years, and three of those I (foolishly) spent my own money on. That’s how I’ve seen firsthand the ways that dust and debris can considerably affect the experience of using a folding phone.</p><p>My first foldable was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, and this was the generation where Samsung <em>almost</em> made folding phones durable. This model year didn’t have many crippling issues at launch, but the problem with foldables is that their durability issues might not show up until a year or two after they’re purchased. That was the case with my Galaxy Z Flip 3. It was fine for the first year, but the built-in screen protector and folding display started to crack right down the middle after a tiny spec of dust got underneath it. </p><p>I then upgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, which was a <em>very</em> expensive foldable. Luckily, that smartphone didn’t suffer from the issues that my Z Flip 3 had. It seems to have held up over time, even though it isn’t my daily driver anymore. The same goes for the Motorola Razr+. It had dust protection, and it’s been mostly fine. </p><p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold review</a> unit is the next example of how dust can cause problems for foldables. There was so much talk about the Pixel Fold not unfolding completely flat when it first launched. It has turned into something of a debate among users and foldable enthusiasts. The real answer, based on my experience, is that it <em>does</em> unfold completely flat when you first start using it. But all it takes is a few pieces of dust for the Pixel Fold not to unfold flat anymore. About a year after receiving my review unit, the device clearly does not open up fully. </p><p>So, after many years and four folding phones, I’m excited that Samsung is making a foldable that is both dust and water-resistant. These problems I’ve listed aren’t something you have to think about while using a slab phone. That’s why, for foldables to grow, it’s a problem that companies like Samsung have to solve. </p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s sub-brand is back with its second generation of earbuds, the CMS Buds Pro 2. The company launched this pair of earbuds next to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-cmf-phone-1-is-a-customizable-budget-phone-starting-at-dollar199">brand new CMF Phone 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/cmf-watch-pro-2-launch">Watch Pro 2</a>. These all aim to disrupt the entry-level segment in the industry. Nothing is launching these products in the U.S., U.K., India, and the European region.</p><p>The second generation Buds Pro come in an interesting new blue color alongside the orange, dark grey (read black), and light grey, as seen in the first generation. Interestingly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cmf-by-nothing-buds-pro-watch-pro-announced">last year&apos;s regular CMF Buds</a> came with a charging case featuring a Smart Dial, not the Pro variant. This time around, the Buds Pro 2 come with a charging case with a Smart Dial next to accompanying color options and with a pocket-friendly design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cowhkMxieaYYggmWBy8iB4" name="CMF-Buds-Pro-2-03.jpg" alt="CMF Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cowhkMxieaYYggmWBy8iB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users can rotate the Smart Dial for volume control, and additional options with customizable functions are available, such as the ability to switch noise cancellation modes, play and pause, or skip tracks. </p><p>Besides, it triggers VoiceAssistant, answers or cuts calls, mutes the microphone and turns Low Lag Mode on and off. To avoid accidental presses, the user can permanently turn off the Smart Dial. All these settings can be managed through the Nothing X app.</p><p>For internals, the Buds Pro 2 are powered by dual driver system comprising a 11mm bass driver and a 6mm tweeter. The new buds support hybrid active noise cancellation alongside transparency mode and have Hi-Res audio certification and spatial audio effect. Users can further adjust bass performance on the accompanying Nothing X app. </p><p>The Buds Pro 2 also promises crystal-clear calls, as each Bud incorporates three microphones and is aided by Nothing&apos;s Clear Voice Technology 2.0.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has been a game-changer in the phone industry. We were impressed with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> last year, and now the company has officially launched its latest device, the CMF Phone 1.</p><p>The headline is that the CMF Phone 1 comes with an attractive starting price of $199 for the 8GB/128GB version, which is the sole option in the US. In North America, you can get your hands on the device exclusively through Nothing&apos;s US Beta Program, where participants receive the phone and are invited to share their experiences.</p><p>In India, the CMF Phone 1 is priced at ₹15,999 (about $192) and only comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. In Europe, you can snag the device for €269 / £239, with an upgraded 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>As you might have guessed, the CMF Phone 1 offers impressive specs at a price usually seen in more modest phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KxvfreeB8LSWhf4udDPdb" name="CMF-Phone-1-NothingOS.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 Nothing OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KxvfreeB8LSWhf4udDPdb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7111" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The handset impresses with a stellar display for its price. The 6.67-inch Super AMOLED screen, 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support, and 2000-nit brightness make for smooth, vibrant visuals, perfect for gamers and everyday users alike.</p><p>Under the hood, the CMF Phone 1 draws its power from MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7300 5G SoC, paired with 16GB of RAM with RAM Booster for smooth multitasking. A 5,000mAh battery keeps it running, and Nothing claims it can last up to two days between charges.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 sticks to Nothing&apos;s unique, personality-packed design. Unlike many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end Android phones</a>, it focuses on user customization. The back has a detachable clip, letting you add a carabiner for easy carrying or use it as a kickstand for hands-free viewing. This cool feature not only looks good but also makes the phone super practical and personal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oTbsst5GgkpUX8s9sUTyt4" name="CMF-Phone-1-detachable-rear-panel.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTbsst5GgkpUX8s9sUTyt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7111" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also comes with a stylish case, and the four screws on the back make the rear panel detachable. This likely means you can easily replace the battery or other parts.</p><p>Now for the camera: The CMF Phone 1 packs a 50MP Sony camera with advanced algorithms like Ultra XDR to brighten under-exposed shots. Up front, there&apos;s a 16MP selfie camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ae3WvgP765FdmE5g68EDi3" name="CMF-Phone-1-camera-official.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ae3WvgP765FdmE5g68EDi3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7111" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The specs show that the CMF Phone 1 isn&apos;t a premium flagship, but it does offer perks you won’t find in other mid-range phones at this price, especially its customizable design.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 breaks the mold with its customizable attachments and user-removable back panel—features you rarely see nowadays. While this modular approach might not be for everyone, Nothing is tapping into a niche market of users who crave more control and personalization.</p>
