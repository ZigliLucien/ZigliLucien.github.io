After a few underwhelming attempts to make a compelling foldable phone, Motorola&apos;s Razr Plus 2023 was a surprise hit, offering much of what consumers wanted in a clamshell. It launched with a flagship chipset, an impressively specced display, and a large and functional cover screen. But despite the highs, there were still plenty of lows that would make some hesitate to drop $1,000 on the phone. Now, with the launch of the Razr 2024, now might be a good time to throw your money in.</p><p>The latest Razr Plus brings plenty of welcome improvements while sticking largely to the same formula as its predecessor. In fact, Motorola doubled down on just about everything introduced in the last model. That means a similar design but with a larger cover screen, more vegan leather, a more up-to-date flagship chipset, and so much more. Meanwhile, the cheaper Razr 2024 borrows just about everything that made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> so great.</p><p>Here&apos;s everything you need to know about Motorola&apos;s latest flagship.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Motorola markets the Razr phones under different names between North American and international markets. We will mostly refer to the phone by its North American branding as the "Razr Plus 2024," although it will be branded as the Razr 50 Ultra outside of the U.S.</em></p>

<p>Motorola launched the Razr Plus 2024 on June 25 at an event in New York City. The phone will be available for preorder on July 10 and will go on sale on July 24.</p><p>As for pricing, Motorola is retaining last year&apos;s price tags, meaning the flagship Razr Plus 2024 will cost $999, while the cheaper Razr 2024 will cost $699. The phones will be available in one configuration, with 256GB on both and 12GB of RAM on the Razr Plus, while the Razr 2024 gets 8GB of RAM.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 comes in four colors: Midnight Blue, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, and Hot Pink. The Razr 2024 comes in three colors: Koala Grey, Beach Sand, and Spritz Orange. Availability of these color options may vary on carrier or region.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="HQX6DUtcd5wyJLZUJmtdvf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-colors.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HQX6DUtcd5wyJLZUJmtdvf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a> was a fairly drastic design shift for Motorola, offering a hole-punch display, refined hinge, and an overall more modern look. With the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, the company took that same design philosophy and ran with it, adopting a largely identical design with front and back panels that curve into the rounded 6000-series aluminum frame.</p><p>The front is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus, while the back of the phone has a vegan leather finish on each of the color variants. There are four different colors, and each has a slightly different texture on the back. The frame also matches the color of the rest of the phone. Meanwhile, the larger cover screen takes up the entire front panel, with two cameras protruding from the bottom corner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zzttxnWvHBCcqEyapM7rs4" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-05.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzttxnWvHBCcqEyapM7rs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Internally, the pOLED display measures 6.9 inches but has been improved with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits. There is still a built-in screen protector on the display, but it&apos;s more seamless and covers more of the panel, including the front-facing camera. The hinge design is largely the same as well, resulting in a very minimal crease across the display. The hinge is also slightly smaller, with more dust protection. The phone itself also has more water resistance, now with an IPX8 rating, meaning the phone can be completely submerged without damage (although we still would not recommend this).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="78tE4SHLAESmQ2jbu5zXTe" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-06.jpg" alt="The back of a Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78tE4SHLAESmQ2jbu5zXTe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A leaked render of the Razr 50 Ultra/Razr Plus 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At 7.1mm thick when open, the phone is slightly thicker than its predecessor, but not by much. Otherwise, the phone has similar dimensions to its predecessor, so anyone coming from the previous phone should feel familiar when handling this new one. The cameras protrude much more than before, so you&apos;ll want to be careful to avoid damaging the lenses.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-plus-2024-specs"><span>Motorola Razr Plus 2024: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="t5eAaVoTNk4BxVU5VvJiq" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-midnight-blue-lifestyle.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 going into a pocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t5eAaVoTNk4BxVU5VvJiq.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is powered by one of the latest Qualcomm chips, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>. It&apos;s not as powerful as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, but it still retains many of the capabilities, especially when it comes to AI. The chipset is paired with 12GB of RAM, so the phone should be able to handle on-device AI and have a better handle on juggling multiple apps or keeping them running in the background.</p><p>Just like its predecessor, the Razr Plus 2024 has 256GB of non-expandable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> storage, meaning you&apos;ll get what you get and no more. Of course, there are options for cloud storage, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most significant changes is to the battery. The capacity has grown to 4,000mAh, up from 3,800mAh on the Razr Plus 2023. That&apos;s a fairly significant capacity jump, and battery life should be much better with a more efficient chipset. This was a weak point for the Razr Plus 2023, and Motorola claims all-day battery life with the Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>Charging specs have also improved, with 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and even 5W reverse-wireless charging.</p><p>Other specs include support for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Dolby Atmos with spatial sound, and the latest Snapdragon Sound technology.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-plus-2024-software-and-features"><span>Motorola Razr Plus 2024: Software and features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3629px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NQwygSPfyCnqp9rymWnYtn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-content-creation-lifestyle.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 folded on a stair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQwygSPfyCnqp9rymWnYtn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3629" height="2042" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 runs Android 14 out of the box with the company&apos;s latest Hello UX on top. Some aspects of the software are similar to what you&apos;d find on the Pixel, but Motorola has added more of its own flair to the UI while borrowing from others. For example, the settings menu is revamped and much more compact than before. Users can also choose a more modern style Control Panel that separates notifications from the quick settings menu, depending on what side of the display you swipe down from.</p><p>Aside from newer Android 14 flourishes, Motorola is also touting some AI features, such as support for the Gemini app, something that has thus far been poorly supported on flip phones. The app can even be used from the phone&apos;s cover screen, and the phone also supports Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sD23hzsuGfwhnDWk7fDR6X" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-01.jpg" alt="Gemini on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sD23hzsuGfwhnDWk7fDR6X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company is also readying a suite of new AI features called Moto AI, which promise to bring more interesting capabilities to the phone. With these features, the phone will be able to "pay attention" to what the user is saying or doing and transcribe or summarize afterward. Moto AI can also summarize notifications and even recall live or on-screen moments so you don&apos;t forget anything.</p><p>Motorola says these features will be available "in the coming months" following the launch of the Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>Lastly, the company promises the Razr Plus 2024 will receive three OS upgrades and four years of software updates, which is in-line with the previous Razr models.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-plus-2024-cameras"><span>Motorola Razr Plus 2024: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oy6csgRftfn4QqXbexjBxP" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-camcorder-mode-lifestyle.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oy6csgRftfn4QqXbexjBxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4752" height="2673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola has included a new set of cameras on the Razr Plus 2024, giving the phone dual 50MP sensors. The primary sensor is a standard wide-angle lens, while the secondary rear camera is a 2x telephoto. Motorola says this should allow users to capture more natural portraits of users without losing any detail when zoomed in.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 also promises improved quality over its predecessor, thanks to the Photo Enhancement Engine, which fine-tunes images "for optimal detail, clarity, highlights, shadows, color, and bokeh effects." Other AI-powered features include Adaptive Stabilization to keep the phone steady when there&apos;s a lot of movement, Action Shot for capturing fast-moving objects or people, and Super Zoom to enhance close-ups using AI.</p><p>Users will also have access to various shooting modes that take advantage of the hinge, like Auto Camcorder Mode, which automatically starts recording video when the phone is held in a camcorder-like position (as seen in the image above). This mode is also capable of shooting video in a vertical orientation, which is ideal for social media.</p><p>Lastly, on the front is a 32MP selfie camera capable of shooting 8MP images thanks to pixel binning.</p>

<p>In addition to the flagship Razr Plus 2024, Motorola has also launched the cheaper Razr 2024, which comes less than a year after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr 2023</a> made its way to North America. The phone adopts a nearly identical design to the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, bringing a larger 3.6-inch OLED panel that allows the use of apps and other features. The phone also comes in vegan leather finishes and, as mentioned before, is available in three different colors.</p><p>The phone is powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek 7300X</a> chipset, which is one of the newest midrange chips at the time of writing and should be a step up from the previous model&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a>. The phone retains 8GB of RAM but doubles its storage capacity to 256GB.</p>

<p>The Razr 2024 gets the same 50MP sensor as the Razr Plus 2024, so the camera should get many of the same improvements. The difference is that the secondary lens is a 13MP ultrawide/macro sensor, seemingly the same as last year&apos;s Razr Plus 2023. The front-facing camera is 32MP.</p><p>Compared to last year&apos;s models, the OLED display has also been improved, with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, although the refresh rate is down to 120Hz. Meanwhile, the cover screen now has a peak of 1,700 nits, but it should also be more battery efficient with a 90Hz refresh rate compared to the 144Hz on the Razr Plus 2023.</p><p>The phone gets the same IPX8 rating as the Razr Plus 2024, so the device is protected from submersion. The battery capacity is the same as last year&apos;s model, but wireless charging has been improved with 15W speeds.</p>

<p>On June 25, Motorola debuted its brand new Bluetooth tracker alongside the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Razr Plus 2024</a>, which will join Google&apos;s revamped Find My Device network.</p><p>According to a press release, the Moto Tag boasts a sleek design that should fit on most of the devices consumers are eager to track. The company states that the device features an IP67 rating to help it withstand dust, dirt, and water immersion (up to one meter) for around thirty minutes. Additionally, the Moto Tag&apos;s replaceable battery is said to keep users going for at least "one year" on a single charge before another is needed.</p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Find My Device network</a> is the kicker for the Moto Tag, and the company states users will experience "pinpoint" locations to find their lost items. Moreover, Moto states that when the Tag is paired with a device with a UWB (ultra-wideband) supported phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">Edge 50 Ultra</a>, the accessory gains a boost in tracking capabilities.</p><p>Consumers can also ping their lost device using the Moto Tag to find it quickly.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Moto Tag features a "dedicated multifunctional button." Pressing it will enable users to find lost items quickly, but it can also be used as a remote camera controller for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>Setting up the Moto Tag is seamless, with the company stating that it only needs to be near your device. Google&apos;s Fast Pair technology takes over from there. After the connection is established, users can customize their Tag&apos;s name, alert volume, battery life, and more.</p><p>Motorola states that privacy remains secure through the Tag. Users&apos; location data is end-to-end encrypted, keeping their information between them and the Find My Device app. The Moto Tag is also compatible with iOS and Android&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">unwanted tracker alerts</a>, so users have peace of mind when traveling. Motorola reiterates that users can run a manual scan to ensure there are no unwanted trackers on their person or luggage.</p><p>The new Motorola Tag will be available on motorola.com starting August 2 for those in the U.S., retailing for $29.99 or $99.99 for a pack of four. Those in Canada can grab it for $39.99 (one pack) or $139.99 (pack of four).</p>

<ul><li>Youtube might be introducing the sleep timer feature that will help users control playback times.</li><li>Users can pick the hours/minutes left until playback stops or even override the sleep time to watch content a bit longer.</li><li>It remains unclear how users will be able to access the feature, assuming it rolls out to everyone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Looks like YouTube will join other streaming apps to help users control their playback times. This feature is said to stop playback automatically after you&apos;ve fallen asleep. </p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-app-sleep-timer-teardown-3453749/">Android Authority</a>, Android expert AssembleDebug looked into the beta version <strong>19.25.33</strong> of the YouTube app for Android and found hints of an upcoming timer functionality. The APK teardown into the app showed references to this feature called "<em><strong>sleep_timer_content_title</strong></em>," it also looks like users can pick the hours and/or minutes left until playback stops. </p><p>There&apos;s also "sleep_timer_notification_channel_name" mention, suggesting that the timer could be displayed as a notification for the user.</p><p>When AssembleDebug clicked on the option, a dialog box popped up that read, "You can reset the timer or click done to keep watching." This means the user can override the sleep timer and watch content a bit longer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mXtRdSHKaRcRcZiHYhC5rk" name="YouTube-sleep-timer.jpg" alt="Youtube Sleep timer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mXtRdSHKaRcRcZiHYhC5rk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This option has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-sleep-timer-on-android">available</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> app for a while now and will presumably work the same way on the video app as well. It displays the time left for playback along with a 5-minute timer or canceling it altogether. It&apos;s one of the most useful features already available on many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming services</a>, including Spotify.</p><p>It remains unclear how users will be able to access the feature, assuming it rolls out to everyone. With Music, users can access the sleep timer option from the three-dot menu on the Now Playing screen.</p><p>Like many unreleased features discovered through an APK teardown, we can&apos;t be certain if or when this will be made available for public release. Given that this feature already exists on the Music app, there&apos;s no reason for Google not to introduce it on the video app. </p><p>YouTube has been seen making several changes to its app, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-on-the-web-gets-a-redesign-but-its-not-winning-everyone-over">redesign</a> that was spotted earlier this week. YouTube Music&apos;s web version now features a two-column layout for albums and playlists, similar to the Android tablet app. The left column displays album art, release year, detailed descriptions, and handy control buttons. Meanwhile, the right column lists tracks with play counts, durations, and artist details.</p>

<p>The Razr Plus 2024 (Razr 50 Ultra internationally) is packed with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> chipset, 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 50MP main camera, and a 50MP telephoto shooter with 2x optical zoom.</p><p>Its cover screen is a major upgrade from last year, featuring a 4-inch pOLED display that outshines even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> cover screen. Razr says it is the biggest cover screen of any clamshell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> on the market, although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v-flip-china-launch">Honor Magic V Flip</a> might have something to say about that.

<p>The standard Razr 2024 (Razr 50 internationally) has roughly the same size and shape but with a smaller cover screen. Its outer display is a 3.6-inch 90Hz OLED, perfect for quick info like calendar alerts, texts, and weather updates. It also offers access to Gemini and Google Photos on the outer screen. Essentially, it&apos;s a refreshed version of last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> with some spec differences.</p><p>It features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a> chipset, a larger 4,200mAh battery, and a 50MP main camera with OIS.

<p>Both the Razr 2024 and Razr Plus 2024 have an IPX8 rating for water resistance and a commitment to three major OS updates and four years of security patches. This is better than previous Motorola commitments but still short of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-expand-security-updates-beyond-5-years">Samsung’s promise of seven OS upgrades and security support</a>.</p>

Both phones bring bigger and better cover screens, improved cameras, and even a taste of some of the latest AI features, and I got to spend some time with them while in New York City for the launch of the Razr 2024 family.</p><p>To say that I&apos;m excited about these phones is an understatement. The Razr Plus 2024, in particular, is a phone that seems to check all the boxes in terms of what I wanted fixed on the previous model, and I just hope that my time with the phone proves me right. But for now, here are my first impressions of the Razr Plus 2024 and its cheaper sibling.</p>

<p>Motorola didn&apos;t make many drastic design changes for 2024. Looking at the Razr Plus 2024 with the screen off, the phone looks nearly identical to its predecessor, save for the sexy new colors that this phone is launching in (more on that later). The phone still struts its curvy frame around like it has something to prove, with the front and back panels rounded off to seamlessly blend into the frame.</p><p>The biggest difference at first glance is the cameras, which now protrude much more from the bottom corner of the cover screen, likely to fit the new sensors. And speaking of the cover screen, that is probably the biggest design change on this phone, measuring at a massive 4 inches and making it one of the biggest on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> (matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v-flip-china-launch">Honor Magic V Flip</a>, which only just beat it to the punch). I&apos;ll also get to that later, but Motorola has refined the overall design of the Razr Plus 2024 while changing only what needed to be changed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="78tE4SHLAESmQ2jbu5zXTe" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-06.jpg" alt="The back of a Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78tE4SHLAESmQ2jbu5zXTe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In hand, the phone feels great and a tad heavier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>. That may be due to the larger battery inside, which now supports faster wired and wireless charging. One improvement I love to see is with the hinge, which appears to be smaller than its predecessor. That doesn&apos;t seem to be to the phone&apos;s detriment, as it now feels much sturdier than before, able to hold its place at various angles without the worrying wobble that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">plagues the last Razr Plus</a>.</p><p>Of course, we&apos;ll have to see how the hinge fares over time, but for now, I&apos;d say this is a very good start.</p><p>When opened, the 6.9-inch OLED display is brighter and seemingly more vibrant than its predecessor. At 165Hz, the display is just as fluid as its predecessor, which is great, especially if you&apos;re a gamer. Motorola also adjusted the built-in screen protector so that it covers more of the display, such as the internal selfie camera.</p><p>The phone is also powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, which Motorola says provides the perfect balance of AI features and performance, although I figure it was likely a cost-related move too. On the plus side, we&apos;re now getting 12GB of RAM, which should be sufficient enough to handle plenty of apps and AI features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-03.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 main display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No 2024 Razr model has glass on the back, which has been Motorola&apos;s thing for 2024 with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Edge 2024</a>. Interestingly, while all the phones have vegan leather on the back, the texture and feel are different with each color. The Spring Green feels a bit like the Motorola Razr 2023, which had a softer feel than the Razr Plus 2023, and the texture feels almost like grass, which is fitting. The Hot Pink (a nice throwback) feels nothing like the Viva Magenta from last year, almost giving a suede texture. The Midnight Blue color option has two different textures, with two leather-like strips on either side of a middle suede-like strip.</p><p>I also like that Motorola has seemingly moved away from the standard black or white color options, so no matter which Razr Plus you buy, it&apos;ll be some unique color that will likely turn some heads.</p><p>Last but not least, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 comes with IPX8 water resistance, meaning you can submerge this phone without worrying. As a result, it seemingly loses the dust resistance rating, but Motorola says the phone should be inherently dust-protected at this level of water resistance. The hinge is also better protected against dust, so it sounds like we really shouldn&apos;t worry.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2024-all-cover-screen-all-the-time-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2024: All cover screen, all the time</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zzttxnWvHBCcqEyapM7rs4" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-05.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzttxnWvHBCcqEyapM7rs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cover screen was no doubt my favorite thing about the Razr Plus 2023 and the biggest reason why I chose it over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. So to keep things exciting, the company made it even bigger this year so that it spans pretty much the entire front of the phone when closed. That means there&apos;s so much more room for activities, and Motorola even revamped the cover screen experience so it&apos;s more fluid and really lets the various panels shine.</p><p>So far, it looks like a <em>huge</em> improvement over the rather dull-looking panels on the previous Razr Plus, although it <em>does</em> give me Galaxy Z Flip 5 vibes with the animations when swiping between panels or the fact that you can now pinch to zoom out and view all your panels at once. The actual panels have also been updated, so they&apos;re more useful, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> finally lets you take up the entire cover screen (a small pain point of mine from the Razr Plus 2023).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p6g6MdZHdoD4AXBhrpWUAh" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-04.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen panels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p6g6MdZHdoD4AXBhrpWUAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display is also much brighter, at 2400 nits, which is perfect for me since I use the cover screen as much as (or maybe more than) the main display. It&apos;s also an LTPO panel with a refresh rate of 165Hz. It seems like overkill, which is exactly what I thought about last year&apos;s cover screen setup, but it&apos;s an LTPO panel this time around, so it should hopefully be easier on the battery, which has also been increased.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> is on this phone, despite not yet being on last year&apos;s model, and not only will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> power some features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a> in Google Messages, but you&apos;ll actually be able to use Gemini from the cover screen, which is actually pretty neat. Motorola talked about various AI features that you&apos;ll be able to access from anywhere on the phone with Moto AI, such as the ability to summarize notifications, transcribe conversations, and remember details to recall later. Basically, it&apos;s turning the Razr Plus 2024 into a Pixel of sorts.</p><p>These features will be available "in the coming months."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sD23hzsuGfwhnDWk7fDR6X" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-01.jpg" alt="Gemini on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sD23hzsuGfwhnDWk7fDR6X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, it looks like Motorola has packed in plenty of new features to help you customize the cover screen, such as various sleep options (including always-on display), desk display modes, a customizable music player, and a Creator Toolkit to take advantage of different camera modes and features when using your favorite social media apps.</p>

<p>Motorola did a good thing and a weird thing this year for the Razr Plus 2024 camera system. To start with the good thing, we now have an improved 50MP primary sensor, which sounds like a big step up from the 12MP camera we got last year (and, at first glance, an actual improvement in quality). However, the weird thing is the switch from a secondary ultrawide camera to a 50MP 2x telephoto lens.</p><p>Yeah, I was scratching my head, too. However, I had the chance to sit down with Allison Yi, Motorola&apos;s executive director of Product Portfolio, and Angelina Gomez, the senior product marketing manager, to discuss the thought behind the move.</p><p>"It was a very big debate," Yi told me during the interview. "But from our perspective, it&apos;s all about the consumer. What do they want? What do they use? What is the most beneficial to them? When we looked at our data, it was very clear that people are using the Portrait Mode." Yi notes that the data shows users opting to use telephoto lenses up to 5x more than they use ultrawide cameras, which was surprising to hear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HsWekdxqNWsAvtMEX5k2C6" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-10.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsWekdxqNWsAvtMEX5k2C6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most flip phones only come with two cameras, and rarely will you find a telephoto lens. Yi and Gomez weren&apos;t able to comment on whether or not there was a discussion to add a third rear lens to this phone or future Razr models, but I imagine it must have been in some part of the debate. That said, a third lens would likely get in the way of the cover screen experience.</p><p>However, it was clear that bringing a telephoto lens was all part of an elaborate scheme to turn us all into content creators by honing in on a camera experience that&apos;s focused on people. That&apos;s where features like Automatic Camcorder Mode come in, which automatically starts recording video when the phone is held up in a camcorder-like form. There are also other unique AI-powered features like Action Shot and Adaptive Stabilization, which are focused on capturing moments, especially fast-paced ones. </p><p>"You don&apos;t have to be an influencer to use this phone," said Gomez, who calls the Razr Plus 2024 her Swiss Army knife. "We want to make sure you have the right tools, and you don&apos;t have to be so technical to understand these things. We want to make sure they&apos;re extremely user-friendly."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oy6csgRftfn4QqXbexjBxP" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-camcorder-mode-lifestyle.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oy6csgRftfn4QqXbexjBxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4752" height="2673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But aside from all the fun AI-powered tricks, the regular camera experience should be much improved at a sensor level. Yi explained that the key aspect of the Razr Plus 2024 camera system is that it now does algorithm analysis on the raw data before it gets to the ISP, which should result in more light and details. This all sounds great, and given how last year&apos;s camera wasn&apos;t exactly my favorite, I&apos;m excited to really test this out to see just how much things have improved.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECcHDoko6rUYJSdC8YhVAj" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-and-Razr-2023-1.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 next to the Razr 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECcHDoko6rUYJSdC8YhVAj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr 2024 next to the Razr 2023. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But of course, we can&apos;t forget about the Razr 2024, which I will lovingly call the "Razr Minus 2024." Gone is the relatively dull <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr 2023</a> design with the small cover screen. This year, Motorola is kicking things up with a "new" design borrowed from last year&apos;s Razr Plus 2023, although with even more vegan leather this time. There are three colors, including a bright Spritz Orange and a Koala Grey, the latter of which feels like straight-up suede (I didn&apos;t wanna take my hands off of it).</p><p>The borrowed design means you get the same 3.6-inch cover screen for apps but with brighter displays and toned-down refresh rates. The main display is 120Hz, which is perfectly fine at this price point, while the cover screen is 90Hz, which I would have loved on last year&apos;s Razr Plus (that was a 144Hz panel).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7HrstJPC4qXfL6yThPSF4a" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-hands-on-1.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HrstJPC4qXfL6yThPSF4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is powered by one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">latest MediaTek chips</a>, which is kind of a big deal since this phone&apos;s price point will likely mean it&apos;ll reach quite a few hands. It also gets the same 50MP main camera as the Plus, although with an ultrawide sensor, likely to keep costs down. Battery remains larger at 4,200mAh and charging speeds have improved.</p>

<p>I won&apos;t talk much about software, but these phones run Motorola&apos;s new Hello UX based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and will receive three OS upgrades and four years of software updates. Given that last year&apos;s Razr Plus has yet to receive Android 14, I&apos;m really hoping Motorola will improve on that front, but I won&apos;t hold my breath. That said, we are expecting new Moto AI features to appear in the coming months, so I look forward to trying those out.</p>
<hr>
<p>I loved the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 so much that I made it my daily driver for the past year. To say that Motorola is doing something really special with these phones is an understatement. The Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 bring plenty of welcome hardware improvements while maintaining the same price point, which is important to note at a time when Samsung is<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-flip-6-leak-reveals-some-disappointing-news-about-their-us-pricing"> rumored to increase the price</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, with no affordable model in sight for the immediate future.

<p>There are a lot of great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> these days, but the Galaxy Tab S9 is easily one of our favorites, with a powerful Snapdragon processor, stunning 120Hz display, and an included S Pen stylus.

<p>If you want something a little more affordable than Samsung's Tab S9 series, consider the 2024 version of the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite. This midrange device boasts a lightweight metal construction, up to 14 hours of battery life, and enough processing power to handle basic tasks with ease. Grab this slab from Amazon today and you'll instantly score a 24% discount. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Included-Expandable-Exclusive/dp/B0CWS8MNW1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8b87ca4d-ecc5-41e5-a8b4-e9304fc3ab82" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The Beats Studio Pro aren't particularly groundbreaking, but they're a solid pair of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> with customizable ANC (active noise cancellation), spatial audio support, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. I wouldn't really recommend buying these cans at full price, but with a 29% discount from Amazon they're a steal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="12b6ee2d-0cc5-49fb-9752-9895271bd0f8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349" data-dimension48="$349">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Any time Amazon starts discounting smart TVs, you can pretty much bet on a few Insignia models being included in the lineup. Still, the retailer is currently carving 33% off the 50-inch F30 Series set, which is an even better discount than I expected. This affordable, no-frills smart TV delivers great picture in 4K Ultra HD resolution, plus you get DTS Studio Sound support and Alexa voice control. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTTVRWPR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d12d4681-c613-46e0-b0a5-de0bc56ae574" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Amazon's Omni lineup of smart TVs is all about bang for the buck, offering premium features like 4K QLED resolution and HDR10+ support with adaptive brightness for much less than the competition. Pick up the 55-inch version and you'll instantly score a 25% discount, sending the midrange set closer to budget TV territory.

<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon has finally confirmed that Prime Day 2024 will start on July 16th at 12:01 am PDT and run through July 17th. That&apos;s about what we predicted when we first launched this guide a couple of weeks back.  </p>
<h2 id="what-is-prime-day-xa0-2">What is Prime Day? </h2>
<p>Prime Day is Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, offering Prime members some of the most epic discounts this side of Black Friday. It started back in 2015 and runs for 48 hours each summer (usually in July). In addition to regular discounts, Prime Day is chock full of flash deals, invite-only opportunities, and much more. </p>
<h2 id="is-prime-day-only-for-members-xa0-2">Is Prime Day only for members? </h2>

A day at the beach. A stay in an AirBnB or VRBO. In the backyard for a small kickback with your buds. I tested the Pill indoors and out, in various locations, and I walked away impressed with the sound output for its size. And could still hear it well <em>while</em> walking away. This is all before connecting to a second Beats Pill in Amplify mode. We’ll get to that in a moment. </p><p>I call the Beats Pill a “musical multivitamin” because it feeds multiple needs for home and portable use scenarios. The feature set shows that the engineers at Beats seriously considered the various ways consumers might use this product and built on what they learned from the success of the Pill Plus.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="izfoYxJbqfUtphLxW88EhY" name="beats-pill-table-in-the-box.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izfoYxJbqfUtphLxW88EhY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beats Pill is available to order for $149.99 from Apple.com beginning June 25th and starts shipping June 27th, or you can wait to order and pick one up in-store on that date as well. You’ll be able to grab one in Matte Black, Statement Red, and Champagne Gold. That gold is beautiful and <em>would</em> be my preferred color, but I’d be concerned about how much wear it would show over time. Because of Southern California’s climate, we’re outdoors throughout the year, and it will get dirty and dinged up.</p><p>For context, there have been improvements over the previous Beats Pill Plus, but this new iteration launches $50 cheaper. The lower launch pricing could result from serious competition from Sony, Skullcandy, Bose, and Anker Soundcore in this segment. We’ll touch on that more later.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-beats-pill-what-i-like"><span>Beats Pill: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VHNsoSDoZAUCGi4DhAtmnT" name="beats-pill-skatepark1.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VHNsoSDoZAUCGi4DhAtmnT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the new Beats Pill, including the fact that it comes with some features you won’t find in the competition at this price point. The exterior is wrapped in a soft-touch silicone that feels wonderful in hand. The grille is metallic, and we’ll see how well its finish stands up to abuse over time. So far, so good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a7eYDgJmqpa3ppaehKzyuX" name="beats-pill-park-bench-grilles.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a7eYDgJmqpa3ppaehKzyuX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">This being a portable speaker</a>, for most consumers, stamina is likely the most important quality other than how it sounds. Depending on the volume level at which you set playback, you’ll get up to 24 hours out of the new Pill. Obviously, you’ll get less if you plug into that USB-C port to charge your source device, which is a handy feature. In one hour, the Pill charged a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> from 0% to 25%, drawing approximately 26% of the Pill’s own power. You can reverse the charge direction and use your phone to juice up your Pill, but I’d recommend having a battery bank if you think you’ll need more than 24 hours of continuous playback. Maybe for a week-long camping trip?</p><p>The Pill itself will take around 2.5 hours to charge from 0 using a 45-watt or higher output charger. It will take longer with a less powerful charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3oQUXpmHBvywPsTEWuboaQ" name="beats-pill-park-bench-usb-c.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3oQUXpmHBvywPsTEWuboaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sticking with that USB-C port for a moment, let’s talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">Hi-Res Audio support</a>. There are other players in the market that do support Hi-Res audio codecs like LDAC, while Apple supports only AAC, and this is likely the reason why the Pill is one of few portable speakers at this price that supports USB-C audio while simultaneously charging your source device.</p><p>I recommend playing out of the USB-C port using either Neutron Player or USB Audio Player Pro, which is my choice for Hi-Res Audio playback on Android. The OS downsamples any audio higher than 16-bit/44.1kHz, and in my testing, the volume never got loud enough if I didn’t use a third-party app for those Hi-Res files. iOS users won’t need to worry about this as volume tested fine out of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> without the need for any third-party apps.</p><p>The USB-C port has some cool charging tricks that I haven’t seen in some of the competition. As mentioned, it supports reverse charging, which will happen automatically or manually. Supplying power is automatic for things like phones and earbuds. For larger supported devices, like tablets or laptops, the Pill will recognize what’s plugged in and determine whether to give or take power from the device. Again, you can initiate this functionality manually. Simply triple-tap the power button to reverse the charging direction, going from powering up your phone or laptop to charging the Pill from it.</p><p>Don’t want to run down your phone while connected? Triple tap again, and you can deactivate charging. To set it back to default, triple-tap once again.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LTCAKPVFaoSktwFSoizXpV" name="beats-pill-park-both-controls.jpg" alt="Beats Pills in Statement Red, and Matte Black on the bleachers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTCAKPVFaoSktwFSoizXpV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The controls are easy to manipulate and intuitive. They sit along the top of the Pill, where the Power button controls on/off and charging direction. Tap it once for an LED color representing battery life, double-tap for voice assistant. Then there’s the Center button, which controls playback and phone calling features. To the right of the Center button is the volume up/down buttons.</p><p>I tested the sound with music and movies, and it doesn’t disappoint. Beats was kind enough to send along two units for review, one Matte Black and one Statement Red. The company wanted me to test out the Amplify and Stereo Listening modes, but more on that in a moment.</p><p>Sound from both the Class 1, Bluetooth 5.3, and USB-C connections is wonderful. Beats went with a single, racetrack-style woofer and single tweeter as opposed to the dual tweeter, dual woofer design of the Pill Plus. I never reviewed the earlier model, so I can’t compare, but the sound out of the 2024 Pill has a large soundstage indoors, with bright highs and solid mids taking center stage with the tuning here.</p><p>Speakers this small aren’t going to produce earth-shattering bass, though the bass response is satisfying for the woofer size and power output. Vocal, classical, and acoustic music shines brightest with the Pill, but the tonal quality of hip-hop and EDM is still satisfying.</p><p>Outdoors, the sound is impressive for its size. I listened to music over Bluetooth using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> app and moved 30 and 50 feet away from the phone and speaker. Audio standing in front of the speaker and off-axis was clear, and vocals were audible and intelligible, even at 50 feet.</p>
<p>Here’s where things got interesting. I put the speakers into Amplify mode, and the combined, synced sound was full and enjoyably loud. The stereo mode is delicious. I watched episode two of “Blue Eye Samurai,” which has a taiko drum scene alongside a fight scene with a riveting stereo sound mix. The bass response from the taiko drums was wonderful, and the sound effects in the mix, which have some sub-bass elements, were all satisfying as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mxrQhhPaNwWEM9qqVC47oZ" name="beats-pill-park-stereo-mode.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mxrQhhPaNwWEM9qqVC47oZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I tested Amplify and Stereo listening modes in the park, at full volume, 15 and 30 feet from the speakers. There was a definite difference in the perceived loudness with Amplify turned on, but the stunner was when I placed the pair in Stereo mode directly from the app (no need to do it manually on the devices, which you can do).</p><p>The stereo separation was really good when I first turned it on, but the speakers were less than a foot apart. To get better stereo sound, you want more separation between the set, so I placed them roughly seven feet apart, and woah! The channel panning and elements in the stereo image were clearly discernable at 30 feet and a pure delight at 15 feet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7aVNj9hBcZCkDpHy9Kcmac" name="beats-pill-park-stereo-mode-30feet.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7aVNj9hBcZCkDpHy9Kcmac.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I will qualify my auditory jouissance with this note, though: generally, manufacturers don’t send along two units to test this feature, so the experience I draw from in critiquing this is minimal. That said, I’m well acquainted with quality stereo imaging, and this is that.</p><p>Rounding out the sound experience, I did use the Pill as a speakerphone on some calls. Speaking with my momma one morning, she said I sounded “clear and crisp.” She was surprised that my audio quality sounded so good coming from a speakerphone device. And if you want to share your Pill at a party, simply jump into the Beats app and tap on the “Share Speaker” button. Your pal can then move their phone, iOS or Android, next to the Pill, pair it, and temporarily hold that DJ party power, which you can take back by tapping on the “Reconnect” button.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8W67en39yNMoTVHMA5iEeR" name="beats-pill-park-bench-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8W67en39yNMoTVHMA5iEeR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Beats Pill has awesome weatherproofing with its IP67 rating. My only concern as a person who spends a decent amount of time at local beaches is the exposed USB-C port. The Pill’s IP rating means it is resistant to dust ingress and water, but with nothing protecting that port, I’d be hesitant to push a USB-C cable into it while on the sand. That said, I likely wouldn’t do that too often anyway because outdoors, with auditory masking being a possible issue, I’d likely not get the full sonic benefit of the increase in dynamic range of a Hi-Res file.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o8WVCEe4qUZ5Zth9fJiNga" name="beats-pill-table-art-blakey.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8WVCEe4qUZ5Zth9fJiNga.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To expand on my earlier note, with the audio volume being low out of the Pixel 7 Pro’s USB-C port, I tested with both the 7 Pro and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> to be sure that’s what it was. I always test and retest this in case any manufacturer updates their phones to remove the downsampling limitation placed on Android OS. There are things you can do in Developer Mode, but most users won’t attempt to futz around with that.</p><p>Last, I would love to be able to use USB-C with Amplify and Stereo modes, but that isn’t supported. It appears that when you plug into the USB-C port for audio, the Bluetooth radio may be disabled, and for those modes, both speakers join to one device via Bluetooth. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-beats-pill-competition"><span>Beats Pill: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edPyRcdCXxfC8iKWFzhLvR" name="sony-ult-field-1-playground.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edPyRcdCXxfC8iKWFzhLvR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a lot of competition around the $150 price point. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony’s ULT Field 1 speaker</a> also throws great sound. Although with the Pill, you’ll get longer battery life and greater sound clarity, you’ll get LDAC for Bluetooth with the Field 1. Skullcandy is well known for producing products with good sound and budget-friendly pricing but also loses in the battery life competition.</p><p>Although I haven’t reviewed the Anker Soundcore Boom 2, on paper, it&apos;s a compelling option with the same 24 hours of battery life, a similar racetrack subwoofer, dual tweeters, and EQ in the companion app. I did check out the smaller Motion 300 and enjoyed its sound output and clarity for its size. Bose also has their SoundLink Flex, which I haven&apos;t reviewed yet. It has only 12 hours of battery life and an older version of Bluetooth.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Beats Pill if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need long battery life</li><li>You want flexibility to use it as a battery bank</li><li>You want something stylish</li><li>You want something small with big sound</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Beats Pill if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>The exposed USB-C port is a concern</li><li>You want Hi-Res Wireless audio support</li></ul>
<p>Beats new Pill is poppin’! You get a stylish, soft-touch shell in vibrant colors (and black), some smart power options, and sound that travels as easily as the Pill itself does. With an IP67 rating, you won’t have to worry about getting the Pill wet on those outdoor excursions. Also, if someone shows up and they also have a Pill, it’s easy to activate Amplify mode and take the sound up a notch. </p><p>If indoors is more your speed, your movies and music will sound great, and if you have a friend over who also has a Pill, you can enjoy some nice Stereo mode action. This is a great option for livening up dorm rooms, Airbnb&apos;s, and camping trips.</p>

<p>The SwitchBot Universal Remote aims to reduce clutter and unify all your home device controls into one physical tool as opposed to your phone or smart speaker&apos;s smart assistant. This includes both smart home devices as well as other electronics that depend on infrared remote controls.</p><p>Gone are the days when IR blasters were a thing on Android phones. Nowadays, if you want to control electronics with your phone, they need to be ready for Google Assistant or Alexa support beforehand. This means that those electronic gadgets need to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">"smart" home devices</a>.</p><p>SwitchBot is trying to eliminate the need to replace your existing dumb devices with smart ones. Instead, you can control anything that accepts infrared commands with the help of your SwitchBot Universal Remote, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/switchbot-hub-2-review">SwitchBot Hub 2</a>.</p>

<p>This kind of a tool can be handy for a number of reasons. Let&apos;s say you have younger kids or senior citizens in your home who aren&apos;t very tech savvy. Or maybe you have guests over and you&apos;d like to give them access to your devices without doing a new voice match on your Google Assistant. A jack-of-all remote that has all your home device controls preloaded into it is much easier to use for people who fall into these categories.</p><p>Setting up the SwitchBot Universal Remote is really quick and easy. A key prerequisite is that you need to have a SwitchBot hub if you want smart assistant connectivity, which basically means that you need it if you want to use the remote properly. And if you want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> connectivity, you need to have the SwitchBot Hub 2 specifically, not the first-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/switchbot-hands-on-making-smart-home-automation-accessible">Hub or Hub Mini</a>.</p>

<p>You can load presets of IR controls from the app, automatically map them, or add them physically to your SwitchBot app and create a virtual remote for your electronics. Once you have added these virtual remotes to your SwitchBot hub and connected your smart assistant(s) of choice, you can go ahead and import those virtual remotes to your SwitchBot Universal Remote.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/6beff17525f2457aba1d100da6d2aea7.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/6beff17525f2457aba1d100da6d2aea7.mp4"></video></div>
<p>The Universal Remote has regular old buttons like volume controls, play and pause buttons, and more, as well as a touch navigation ring. There&apos;s an interesting red "S" button that lets you switch between your virtual remotes from within the SwitchBot Universal Remote&apos;s interface. It has a tiny display which helps you pick virtual remotes loaded onto it.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to worry about changing the batteries on your SwitchBot Universal Remote as it supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charging</a> and has a 2,000mAh battery. A single charge should last you about 150 days.</p>

<p>SwitchBot gives you the ability to create scenes and launch them directly from the Universal Remote. You can set smart home automations in motion literally with the click of a button.</p><p>Matter connectivity is cool to have, but it can be finicky to set up and use as I found during my testing. Google Assistant and Alexa work just fine, but you can&apos;t use them directly with the remote which is such a missed opportunity. The SwitchBot Universal Remote doesn&apos;t have a mic, so you need to rely on your smart speaker or phone for hands-free controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a82t5qXB7bvsreXBav948b" name="SwitchBot-Universal-Remote-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="SwitchBot Universal Remote" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a82t5qXB7bvsreXBav948b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The SwitchBot Universal Remote supports around 80,000 devices including air conditioners, fans, lights, TV boxes, DVD players, streamers, projectors, air purifiers, robot vacuums, etcetera. Naturally, pairing with SwitchBot&apos;s own smart home devices such as smart plugs, smart bots, and smart curtain bots is even more seamless.</p><p>As for the remote itself, it can manage 25 devices (including 10 IR remotes and 15 Bluetooth communication SwitchBot devices) and 10 SwitchBot scenes at one time. You will have to replace select devices or scenes if you hit this limit.</p>

<p>I didn&apos;t question the need for a tool like the SwitchBot Universal Remote. What I did wonder about, however, was why users need to use a SwitchBot hub along with the Universal Remote. See, the SwitchBot Universal Remote is not very useful without a hub, and all of the brands smart hubs have the IR remote functionality anyway.</p><p>So if I did get a smart hub from SwitchBot, why would I go out of my way to buy the Universal Remote? If it had a mic, you&apos;d have one very good reason because none of the SwitchBot hubs have one onboard. But it doesn&apos;t have a microphone, so it&apos;s very hard to build a case for the Universal Remote while a SwitchBot Hub, Hub 2, or Hub Mini exists.</p><p>If you are interested in getting a physical remote for all your household gadgets, the SwitchBot Universal Remote is a cool way to control, manage, and access it all. However, it might not add much in terms of practical usefulness, besides physical buttons.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge 2024</a> is fresh out of the oven, so there aren&apos;t as many phone cases available for it just yet. You do have a handful of nice options out of the gate, and we&apos;ve rounded up the best of the best for you right here.</p><p>Suitable for all kinds of users, the ZAGG Luxe Case for Motorola Edge 2024 is the best phone cover overall. The brand is a reliable one in the biz. You get 10-feet drop protection from the ZAGG Luxe Case for Motorola Edge 2024 and it even kills germs thanks to its antimicrobial layer. Plus, the pricing is pretty reasonable too.</p><p>If you&apos;re in the market for a plain old clear case, the Motorola Edge 2024 Hybrid Crystal Clear Case is a no-brainer. Sure, you can get a ton of cheap clear cases for the device from Amazon, but they don&apos;t guarantee quality like a first-party accessory does. That&apos;s why this soft TPU phone cover is our pick if you&apos;re looking for something see-through.</p>
