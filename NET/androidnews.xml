<hr>
<p>Google may be eying an Android accessibility feature that aims to limit the effect of motion sickness while using a smartphone or tablet in the car. A few code snippets relating to an unannounced <strong>Motion Cues</strong> feature were discovered in an APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-services-motion-cues-apk-teardown-3500830/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. While not a lot of information about this rumored feature is available, it's likely similar to <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong>, an accessibility tool in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18</a> that adds visual signals to your phone screen.</p><p>Motion sickness is a common problem that can be made worse by using a smartphone or tablet in the car. That's because while looking at your phone screen, your mind and body aren't able to recognize and adjust changes in vehicle movement. As such, Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues add dots to your iPhone's screen that indicate which direction a car is moving. They're clear enough to give your mind an idea of how the car is moving, while being unobtrusive enough to not significantly impede phone use.</p><p>These visual cues, as demonstrated by Apple in the graphic below, are intended to limit the effects of motion sickness. Soon, they could be coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="QsLT2tNNecvp9PzoMEff9" name="Motion-Cues-iOS-18" alt="An example of Motion Cues in iOS 18." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QsLT2tNNecvp9PzoMEff9.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="864" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In <strong>version 24.46.30</strong> of the Google Play Services beta, Android Authority spotted multiple code strings related to "motion sickness." Specifically, the code references a feature that is presumably called <strong>Motion Cues</strong>. It's described as being used to "show visual cues to mitigate the motion sickness." In other words, it sounds a lot like Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues in iOS 18.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="motion_sickness_enabled_key">motion_sickness_enabled</string>
<string name="motion_sickness_settings_activity_label">Motion Cues</string>
<string name="motion_sickness_settings_page_description">Show visual cues to mitigate the motion sickness.</string></code></pre>
<p>The feature isn't active yet, and the code snippets aren't exactly clear on how Google plans to implement these motion cues in Android. However, being that the strings are appearing in the Google Play Services beta and not an Android beta, it's possible that Motion Cues could eventually rollout for multiple Android versions. There's precedent for this, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Android's latest security updates</a> recently rolled out to most devices running Android 10 or higher.</p><p>Still, being that this feature is currently in the development stage, it's impossible to know for sure when (or if) it will release publicly.</p>

<hr>
<p>To celebrate its 50th anniversary of making big, rugged watches for athletes, Casio is selling an absurd, adorable little smartwatch that fits on your finger but barely qualifies as a "smart ring" <em>or</em> a fitness device.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.casio.com/jp/watches/casio/product.CRW-001-1/">Casio CRW-001-1JR</a>, launching in December 2024 in Japan for ￥19,800 (about $128 USD), isn't like traditional smart rings since it has no health tracking functionality. Instead, the design "combines practicality and playfulness" (via Google Translate) into a 1/10-sized watch with a stainless steel frame, LCD, and three buttons (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/the-new-casio-crw-001-1jr-is-both-a-smart-ring-and-a-smartwatch">Techradar</a>).</p><p>It measures 6.2mm thick and weighs 16g, well above the usual 3mm thickness and 2–5g weight of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a>. Aside from being a conversation starter, the Casio smart ring has programmable alarms to wake you up and a stopwatch function for up to 60 minutes.</p>

<p>Aside from Casio superfans, this quirky novelty tech may not appeal to many people. But the idea of a smart ring that takes after smartwatches is a persistent one, and it's unclear how close smart rings will eventually stray into smartwatch territory with more <em>traditional</em> smarts beyond health.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-05.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most smart rings are meant to be invisible; unless you look at the companion app on your phone, you wouldn't even know if it's working. But a few rings specifically take after smartwatches — if not to the extent of the Casio smart ring.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> supports gesture control shortcuts for phone connectivity, just as smartwatches have gesture tricks like the double-tap.</p><p>The Circular Ring has a haptic motor for gently waking you up, signaling notifications or medication reminders, and guiding you during meditation. The original Pro had a button to end haptic feedback, while the newer Circular Slim has a reactive touch surface on the logo.</p><p>Early smart ring prototypes like the Smarty Ring and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motiv-ring-review">Motiv Ring</a> had outer displays or LED indicators, following in line with smartwatches at the time. Motiv, for instance, would let you twist the ring to trigger a gesture and then light up the LED if it was successful. A green light signaled a 100% charge, a blue light meant data syncing, and so on.</p>

<p>If you look into the Wild West of smart ring Indiegogo campaigns today, several of them have some kind of touch strip or multi-color LED indicator. Though there's no guarantee any of them will successfully launch, and they have other ambitious promises like blood pressure tracking, people still spend millions on these prototypes, hoping for the best.</p><p>Right now, successful and established smart rings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> have designs centered on their lightness and traditional style. Almost no one wants an LED strip or bulky design that calls attention to the ring's techy nature; they want subtlety.</p><p>But I wonder — as smart rings continue to flood the market offering the same health data — if  we'll see more phone-ring integration to make rings more of a watch replacement for people who wear basic luxury watches instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> or Apple Watches.</p><p>Basically, I'm curious if future smart rings will take the same approach as hybrid watches, with a tiny strip that looks "normal" but can occasionally light up with a tiny notification, letting you know whether or not to take your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>But until smart rings can pull that off more subtly than Casio's unintentionally hilarious design, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-key-differences">smart rings and smartwatches</a> should probably stay in their own lanes.</p>

<ul><li>Google TV may be aware users might be getting tired of ads, so it's running a survey asking users if the home screen ads are too much.</li><li>The survey, popping up on Onn 4K Boxes, gets users to rate if they "strongly agree" or "strongly disagree" with the ads.</li><li>While the survey could cut back on ads, it might also justify adding more, especially with Google's ad-driven revenue.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google TV recently sent out a survey to some users, stirring up concerns by asking how they feel about the number of ads popping up on the homescreen.</p><p>9to5Google spotted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1gtzc27/got_this_survey_on_my_onn_4k_google_is_asking_if/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> showing Google asking some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> users in the U.S. what they think about the home screen ads—but just those, nothing else.</p><p>The survey shows up in the bottom-right of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review">Onn 4K Box</a>, asking if the home screen ads on Google TV are a deal or a drag. The options range from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree.”</p>

<p>The survey indicates that Google knows people might be getting fed up with all the ads on Google TV. It’s just a sign that ads are pretty much a permanent part of the digital scene now.</p><p>Google’s push for more ads on Google TV is ruffling some feathers. While the survey might lead to fewer ads, it could just as easily be a way to back up adding even more. And with Google’s ad money machine running strong, don’t count on ads disappearing anytime soon.</p><p>It’s a bummer to watch the once ad-free digital world fill up with ads. Many of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">favorite streaming services</a> were once all about ditching traditional TV, but have now jumped on the ad-revenue bandwagon too.</p><p>Google TV, once all about personal recommendations, has turned into an ad-heavy platform, now bombarded with autoplay video ads. This shift from chill suggestions to in-your-face commercialization is part of a bigger trend where entertainment and ads are blending together more than ever.</p><p>Google is not the only one leaning into on-device ads for cash. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-interactive-ads">Amazon has been rolling out new features</a> with the same idea, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-ceo-video-ads-home-screen-confirmed">Roku has found ways to make money by running ads</a> during gameplay breaks.</p>

<ul><li>ASUS launched its ROG Phone 9 series today and the duo features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.</li><li>Its design remains close to the Phone 8 series, with the unique dot matrix rear panel and a new cooling accessory, the Chill Case.</li><li>The ROG Phone 9 Pro will be available for $1,199 while the base model starts at $999.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The next generation of gaming phones is here from ASUS as its latest flagship duo debuts.</p><p>As ASUS launches the ROG Phone 9 series, it kicks things off by highlighting the Pro model. Appearance-wise, the device remains similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">Phone 8 Pro</a>. Users will find a 6.7-inch FHD+ panel with up to 165Hz refresh rate. However, ASUS says users can push its fresh rate even further, up to 185Hz, through the "Game Genie." Protecting the Phone 9 Pro's display is Corning's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>.</p><p>The back of the device sees more of the same as ASUS continues to feature AniMe Vision. The company revealed the change from its LED lighting with the 8 Pro. For a second time, users are treated to a dot matrix on its rear panel, which acts like a secondary screen. ASUS states this matrix offers 648 programmable mini-LEDs for animations and interactions.</p><p>ASUS detailed the continuation of the phone's squarish triple camera array. The company states the Phone 9 Pro features a 50MP Lytia 700 Sony sensor with lossless 2x zoom and OIS (optical image stabilization). The main camera is joined by a 13MP ultrawide lens and a 32MP telephoto sensor.</p><p>The front selfie camera enters at 32MP.</p>

<p>At the heart of the ROG Phone 9 Pro are those AI veins alongside Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and Android 15. The SoC provides the device with a 4.30GHz, Octa-core processor alongside the Adreno 830 GPU. For AI, ASUS states the Phone 9 Pro features its X Sense, X Capture, and AI Grabber. These three tools combined can assist gamers with recording highlights while gaming, finding tips, and "tracking enemy spawns."</p><p>The device features even more on-device AI for daily tasks, such as AI Call Translator, Transcript, Wallpaper, Noise Cancellation, and "Sematic Search."</p><p>With such power, ASUS highlights the Phone 9 Pro's cooling systems in place. The device reportedly uses a graphite sheet to increase heat dissipation by roughly 57%. This is said to have improved the phone's cooling abilities by ~12%. However, users can opt to purchase additional cooling accessories like the AeroActive Cooler X Pro or the new ROG Chill Case.</p><p>Those interested can check out Android Central's full review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, including how it fairs performance and battery-wise.</p><p>The ROG Phone 9 Pro will be available soon for $1,199 in white and Phantom Black.</p>

<p>The duo of this new gaming phone series is the base ASUS Phone 9. Most of the base model remains close to the Pro variant; however, a major difference is with its cameras. The base Phone 9 features the same 50MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide lens. The telephoto sensor is replaced with a 5MP macro camera.</p><p>Users will be able to purchase the ROG Phone 9 in white and Phantom Black for $999 in the U.S.</p>

<ul><li>Google released the first developer preview of Android 16 today, and surprisingly, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are supported.</li><li>The two phones were guaranteed Android version updates through 2024, so the update to Android 16 wasn't a given.</li><li>While this still doesn't guarantee Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro users will get the stable Android 16 release, it bodes well for the phones' future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">dropped its first preview of Android 16 today</a>, with a release aimed at developers. If you're a developer and have a Google Pixel phone, you can flash an Android 16 Developer Preview 1 system image to try out the new features now. Surprisingly, the list of supported Pixel phones includes the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/19/pixel-6-android-16-dp1/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Being that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro weren't guaranteed the update to Android 16, this is a positive sign that those two phones could get it after all.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> and 6 Pro, released in 2021, are the oldest Pixel phones supporting Android 16 Developer Beta 1. They were officially guaranteed full OS updates through October 2024, plus security updates for an additional two years. That would mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is the last guaranteed Android version update for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. Regardless, it's possible that Google goes above and beyond, shipping Android 16 to those smartphones.</p><p>For now, Pixel 6 users can download the system image for Android 16 Developer Preview 1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dl.google.com/developers/android/baklava/images/ota/oriole_beta-ota-bp21.241018.009-b1a9d5fc.zip" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro">Pixel 6 Pro</a> users can get their system image <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dl.google.com/developers/android/baklava/images/ota/raven_beta-ota-bp21.241018.009-1075add0.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. However, since this is still a developer preview, it's not recommended that users install the preview on their main device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's still a long way to go before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> nears platform stability. The support for Android 16 Developer Preview 1 doesn't guarantee that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro receive the final release in mid-2025. Google could be testing the waters to see how these older devices perform running the new OS, and make the call of whether they're up to the task later on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1418px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:23.06%;"><img id="bWFzR6evEiAM759kFoNVT8" name="Android-16-Platform-Stability-Schedule" alt="Android 16 platform stability schedule." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bWFzR6evEiAM759kFoNVT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1418" height="327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro continue to receive Android 16 previews and beta releases, especially as they near platform stability, there's a good chance these phones will get the full Android 16 release. However, we're a long way out from that, and Pixel 6 and 6 Pro users should watch for the compatibility future previews and beta releases. For those holding onto a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro in 2024, this early support is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Mint Mobile is an interesting carrier. Unlike other phone companies that bog you down with confusing contracts and hidden fees, Mint keeps it simple by selling T-Mobile-powered wireless in three, six, and 12-month increments of time. All of Mint&apos;s plans come with high-speed data on T-Mobile&apos;s legendary 5G network, plus you get a free mobile hotspot, calls to Mexico and Canada, and no confusing fine print. The carrier also supports most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and there are typically loads of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> that can get you into the service for dirt cheap. </p><p>Sure, there are some drawbacks with Mint Mobile, but they are mostly due to the carrier&apos;s simple business structure. Mint has no retail locations, for instance, and you must purchase a minimum of three months of service to join. The Unlimited plan also only gives you 10GB of mobile hotspot data each month, and you lose out on some of the premium international perks and entertainment benefits offered by certain larger carriers. </p><p>With Mint, what you see is what you get, and right now I&apos;m seeing some pretty outstanding Black Friday offers. If you&apos;re on the hunt for a new wireless carrier, that might be enough. </p>

<hr>
<p>Affordable foldable phones have been long overdue from Samsung since the inception of the original Galaxy Z series. While many users await them, recent rumors indicate they are finally happening—in the form of Fan Edition models that Samsung usually makes for the flagships.</p><p>Display analyst Ross Young has shared exciting information about the upcoming Galaxy foldable phone, dubbed Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. In his X post, Young shared that the anticipated first clamshell Fan Edition phone is indeed coming in 2025—although the analyst has yet to reveal the precise time frame.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Those hoping for a Z Flip 7 FE should be excited. It looks like a Samsung FE clamshell is finally coming in 2025.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1858665253267271860">November 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>In the following comments, Young has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1858666606513320214">further shared</a> that the FE clamshell phone will carry the same display as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> successor, the Galaxy Z Flip 7. However, the cameras and processors underneath will likely be different. The Z Flip 7 is expected to carry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">a Snapdragon 8 Elite </a>chipset, given the Galaxy foldables history is any indication.</p><p>The latest info from Young <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-s24-internal-chip-rumors">corroborates with previous leaks</a> of the FE clamshell phone, indicating that it would launch alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Further, the device is expected to feature 2023's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> chipset, which powered some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24</a> models in regions like Europe and India.</p>
<p>Samsung has a tradition of using the Exynos chip, especially in the Galaxy FE series, which is likely due to cost when compared to Snapdragon. Aside from the anticipated chipset, nothing concrete about the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available yet.</p><p>While it is still too soon to predict what to expect, the thought of the FE clamshell phone under development is already great news since it might pave the way for more affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> for the masses.</p><p>According to its Q3 financial report, Samsung appears to be embracing the concept. The company mentioned that it was exploring ways to "lower entry barriers" for anyone who wanted to buy its foldable phones. This also explains the launch of the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE, which will perhaps be released before the Z Fold 7 FE, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1858681754342891826">according to Young</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The first developer preview of Android 16 is here, and it comes with a handful of new features and plans for a quicker release schedule.</li><li>Google plans to release Android 16 an entire quarter earlier than usual, targeting a Q2 2025 release date.</li><li>Android 16 includes a few new APIs that developers can take advantage of in their apps, including an embedded photo picker and health records.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following rumblings that the next version of Android would debut earlier than usual, Google today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/11/first-developer-preview-android16.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the first developer preview of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. It’s our first look at Android 16, and it comes as Google confirms that it’s planning to release a final version of it an entire quarter earlier than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. While there will still be only one major Android release each year, this new schedule will add a second minor SDK release in late 2025 that adds new APIs and features.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-features-and-apis-coming-to-android-16-2">The new features and APIs coming to Android 16</h2>
<p>There are already a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-could-borrow-this-key-feature-from-windows-11">few leaks and rumors regarding Android 16</a>, and we’ll certainly learn more about the update as development continues. However, Google is sharing an early look at some developer APIs coming to Android 16 in the first developer preview.</p><p>Android users are probably familiar with the system photo picker, but Android 16 will let developers embed the photo picker into their app’s view hierarchy for a more streamlined experience. Additionally, there’s an early access program for a Health Records API that will allow apps to manage health records with user consent. Finally, Android 16 Developer Preview 1 includes the latest version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-privacy-sandbox-beta">Android Privacy Sandbox</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-release-schedule-for-android-2">The new release schedule for Android</h2>
<p>Android 16 ushers in a new era for Google’s release schedule for not only this Android version, but future releases. The company is sticking with quarterly updates; however, it’s now adding a second SDK release of Android yearly. The major SDK release will arrive in Q2 2025, months earlier than usual, and that is the full Android 16 update. There will also be a minor SDK releases in Q4 2025 that adds new developer APIs and features.</p><p>Usually, there’s only one Android update annually that brings these new developer APIs, but that’s changing. Google notes that the final, minor SDK update in 2025 won’t include any “app-impacting behavior changes,” which should be good news for developers. Due to the major SDK release being pushed up, the Q1 2025 and Q3 2025 releases are now the minor, quarterly updates that only include new features.</p>

<p>The shift will allow Android 16 to reach platform stability sooner. Google is now aiming to hit platform stability in March and April of next year, with a final release of Android 16 to follow.</p>

<p>Google’s preview program starts now with Android 16 Developer Preview 1, and will continue through the update’s official release. The developer preview stage is typically when Android is at its most raw and unstable, but it will become more stable as it reaches the beta release stage. Being that Android 16 is releasing sooner, app developers will need to begin testing sooner to ensure their apps are compatible.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced the rollout of "Saved Info" for its AI model Gemini for Gemini Advanced users through the Google One AI Premium plan.</li><li>The company states users can "ask" Gemini to remember certain preferences, key details about their work, or that they're a vegetarian.</li><li>Google states users will have full control of the data Gemini has saved about them, meaning they can view, edit, and delete anything.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Gemini is picking up a feature today (Nov 19) that brings the AI into a more personal space.</p><p>In a press release, Google states it's rolling out a new feature for Gemini today called "Saved Info." The company adds that the feature is designed to make interactions with its AI model "even more helpful and personalized." Users can reportedly ask Gemini to remember "your life, work, and preferences."</p><p>Gemini's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/updates">patch notes</a> held more key details about "Saved Info." Engaging with the feature is said to help the AI deliver more "relevant responses" as they will be (ideally) tailored specifically to your needs. Google says users won't have to unnecessarily repeat the same key details for Gemini to focus on.</p><p>It seems that users can "ask" Gemini to remember certain details in a few different ways. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1858929151476199591">post on X</a>, Google highlighted users' ability to begin their "Saved Info" prompt by saying "Remember," "Keep in mind," or "Always provide." While these prompts can pertain to your hobbies or work, users can also tune Gemini to deliver information in a specific language every time or how to help you brainstorm ideas.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rolling out starting today, you can ask Gemini Advanced to remember your interests and preferences for more helpful, relevant responses. Easily view, edit, or delete any information you've shared, and see when it’s used.Try it in Gemini Advanced → https://t.co/Yh38BPvqjp pic.twitter.com/gR354OZxnV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1858929151476199591">November 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>More importantly, "Saved Info" includes a few tools for privacy reasons. Users can quickly view what preferences Gemini has saved for you on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/saved-info">dedicated page</a>. Moreover, you can edit or delete this information if it's no longer pertinent.</p><p>Google states Gemini's ability to remember your preferences is rolling out today (Nov 19). The feature is restricted to Gemini Advanced users in English through the Google One AI Premium plan.</p><p>Gemini updates have continued to roll out these past few months, like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-split-screen-window-expanding-to-large-screens">split-window feature</a> for larger devices. The end of October improved the Gemini experience for foldables and tablets Users with those devices can now utilize the AI's assistance while browsing the Play Store, scrolling social media, and more. The floating overlay for Gemini also got updated as users can quickly pop it into split-screen mode through its new button.</p><p>Another major update that made its rounds last week was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-on-iphone-dedicated-app-launch">Gemini on iPhone</a>. Apple's iOS slabs can now download a dedicated Gemini app with Imagen 3 at its core. The app lets users create "photorealistic" images through prompts alongside its conversational <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>. Additionally, iPhone users can take advantage of Gemini's extensions, meaning they can link up their Gmail, Docs, and other Workspace apps for quick assistance.</p>

<p>Telegram is rolling out a massive update focused on mini-apps, which are handy in-app tools giving developers more ways to push boundaries.</p><p>Telegram’s Mini Apps 2.0 takes your gaming experience up a notch with full-screen mode that works smoothly in both portrait and landscape, the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/fullscreen-miniapps-and-more" target="_blank">blog post</a> states.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.00%;"><img id="UNKrfWtDzJtLNeXUQHMJTD" name="Telegram--mini-apps-full-screen" alt="full-screen mode for mini apps on Telegram" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UNKrfWtDzJtLNeXUQHMJTD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="882" height="538" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-telegram-premium">Telegram</a> is also bringing motion-sensing controls to the gaming experience, especially for VR titles. It’s a more intuitive way to play than just tapping. Plus, devs can lock the screen orientation for a smoother gaming session.</p><p>The platform's smart use of device hardware lets mini-apps run at their best, offering a smoother experience by adjusting to your device’s power and memory. Plus, with gyro controls, Telegram says gaming gets way more interactive and immersive.</p><p>Telegram’s latest update also gives developers fresh tools like sending gifts to users and customizing the loading screen.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a> is also making it easier to access your favorite mini-apps by letting you create shortcuts right on your home screen. It cuts down the wait time and makes using the apps way more efficient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:873px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:89.00%;"><img id="TttNhgYqr4qAWhkiC8LK5S" name="Telegram--mini-apps-home-screen-shortcut" alt="homescreen shortcut option for Telegram mini apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TttNhgYqr4qAWhkiC8LK5S.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="873" height="777" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, mini-apps now offer features like document creation and location-based services. You can easily download files and get location-specific info, like weather updates and maps. To keep things private, location sharing is off by default and needs your approval for each mini-app.</p><p>Telegram is giving developers a way to make money with mini-apps through a subscription model. Users can easily subscribe to their go-to mini-apps using in-app Telegram Stars.</p><p>Finally, the update brings a ton of new features for both developers and users. Developers can now let users share media and referral codes right from mini-apps. Plus, premium users can set emoji statuses directly within the mini-apps.</p><p>These changes might seem small, but they make a big difference in how efficiently you use the app.</p>
