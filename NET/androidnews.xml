<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung might be working on a new feature called "Battery AI" that could save up to 10% battery life on next year's Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>The details aren't crystal clear, but it seems like Battery AI might smartly shut down unnecessary background tasks to save power without slowing down the phone.</li><li>The feature is expected to work with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 and Exynos 2500 processors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung could be developing a new AI feature that will supposedly save users up to 10% battery life in next year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series.</p><p>A tipster who goes by the name PandaFlash on X (formerly Twitter) has shared some inside information from an unnamed source about Samsung&apos;s new feature dubbed "Battery AI." The new solution will reportedly boost the battery life of the Galaxy S25 series by 5% to 10% (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s25-battery-ai-feature-increase-total-backup/" target="_blank">Wccftech</a>).</p><p>Some software solutions already stretch out battery life by dialing back the processing power or toning down certain components, like 5G modems. PandaFlash didn&apos;t get the specifics on how Samsung&apos;s Battery AI works, but the tipster claims it might find sneaky background tasks that drain your battery without hurting your phone&apos;s speed.</p><p>But even if this feature pans out, it won&apos;t magically give the phone a bigger battery. It would likely be a super-smart way to manage what&apos;s running in the background, kind of like closing unused tabs on your computer to save power. This could involve stopping background activity of unused apps or adjusting settings based on how you use your phone.</p><p>Earlier reports suggested the Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra might not get a battery boost, but this AI feature could help them last longer anyway.</p><p>PandaFlash didn&apos;t really specify if Battery AI will launch with the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Samsung phones</a>, but since they mostly talk about the 2025 flagship line, it&apos;s a safe bet that the feature could debut early next year with the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>It would also need to be compatible with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> and Exynos 2500 processors expected to run the 2025 models.</p><p>This feature seems like it would fit right in with Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> suite of features. Galaxy AI has already made a big mark on smartphones by pushing the envelope on AI integration. If this rumor is correct, it makes sense that the Galaxy S25 would be next in line to get some brainy battery-saving technology.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung filed a U.S. patent for "continuous atrial fibrillation detection via PPG to ECG signal translation" on April 18.</li><li>The patent describes a generative AI model that interprets heart rate data as ECG waveforms.</li><li>Samsung, Apple, and Fitbit watches have passive irregular heart rhythm notifications that prompt you to take active ECGs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Many smartwatches perform atrial fibrillation (AFib) spot checks using an ECG sensor, but continuous AFib data isn&apos;t feasible without a medical monitor. Last month, Samsung patented a plan to change that for future wearables like the Galaxy Watch 7 by employing a generative AI model.</p><p>First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-could-continuously-scan-for-heart-conditions" target="_blank">Wareable</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20240122519" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> "System and method for continuous atrial fibrillation detection via PPG to ECG signal translation" would "translate PPG signals to corresponding ECG waveforms."</p><p>Samsung got FDA approval for passive detection of irregular heart rhythm using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watches</a> last year, and Fitbit, Apple, and Withings do the same. But this method can only guess at a problem and prompt you to take an active ECG reading to confirm. </p><p>Samsung&apos;s patented PPG-to-ECG method would (hypothetically) give you more definitive data at all times, making it more likely to catch the lead-up to serious heart conditions like arrhythmia and heart failure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bFjrPdizKF5fmyQfzoTtG9" name="ppg-to-ecg-patent-exhibit-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung patent images showing PPG data converted into ECG data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bFjrPdizKF5fmyQfzoTtG9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / U.S. Patent Office)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The patent explains that "conventional models" can only rely on "long-term relationships" between PPG heart rhythm data and likely ECG results. With its GenAI models, Samsung claims, it will create a "first-order <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov relationship</a>" between them for better accuracy.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s patent acknowledged that by using generative AI, "fake information may be introduced, which affects an AFib detection result." It plans to solve this by "incorporating prior knowledge in terms of probabilistic graphical models" so that it is "robust to noise," aka irrelevant or misleading information. </p><p>Samsung&apos;s generative AI plan could make your heart health data available to Google since it typically relies on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a>; we&apos;ll have to confirm when it arrives whether this is an issue from a privacy standpoint.</p>

<p>Samsung even describes a "fusion mechanism" between actual ECG readings and GenAI-made ECG waveforms to translate future PPG data into actionable ECGs better.</p><p>Beyond that, Samsung&apos;s patent is far too technical for a layman to parse reasonably, with in-depth equations (<em>see the charts above</em>) showing the correlation between PPG and ECG data.</p><p>What matters to Galaxy Watch owners is that this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> feature will probably come to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and other future wearables, making it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> to beat for anyone concerned about their heart health. </p><p>Apple got FDA approval to call Apple Watches a "Medical Device Development Tool" for AFib detection last week (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/02/apple-watch-afib-feature-fda/" target="_blank">9to5Apple</a>), so this patent could help Samsung even in the playing field once it&apos;s implemented and tested for accuracy. </p><p>We&apos;ll see if the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> — which will have a PPG of its own — could take advantage of this feature. Beyond that, we&apos;re curious to see if Samsung has other GenAI tricks to improve the health data from its Galaxy Watches.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new colorway for the OnePlus 12 could soon make a global debut. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-12-glacial-white-color-launch-internationally-3440131/">first spotted by Android Authority</a>, a code hinting at a white colorway exclusive to China was found hidden in the recent OxygenOS v14.0.0.608.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> has been around since February this year and has been rated as one of the overall <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones of 2024</a>. The device is known for its sleek design, fast processor, ultra-fast charging speeds, and epic battery life. It comes in two colorways at the moment—Flowly Emerald and Silky Black. </p><p>A user on X, who goes by 1NormalUsername, discovered the new variant in the OxygenOS code and mentioned that this colorway will be officially dubbed "Glacial White." Android Authority adds that the white color variant of the OnePlus 12 was previously only mentioned in ColorOS builds since the OnePlus 12 runs ColorOS in the region.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:994px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:34.41%;"><img id="gse6Bq6wxuKaHZ6nt5WX6V" name="oxygen-os-white-oneplus-12-code.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 Glacial White" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gse6Bq6wxuKaHZ6nt5WX6V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="994" height="342" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It remains uncertain when the company plans to release this colorway to the rest of the world. However, the mere presence of the recent OxygenOS update suggests the Glacial White variant could also be coming to other countries. Some speculate it could be released only to a specific region, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, which rolled out in a third Nordic Blue color variant in April across Europe, in addition to Radiant Steel and Black Steel.</p><p>Alternately, OnePlus might follow Google&apos;s strategy with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-mint-green">Mint Green Pixel 8</a>, making it a limited edition option to boost hype around the product mid-way through its launch cycle.</p><p>Back in 2022, OnePlus released an Extreme Edition version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_10_pro_is_now_available_in_white-news-53233.php">OnePlus 10 Pro</a>, which was available in Panda White and featured a ceramic back with 512 GB storage. However, the company made this version exclusive to China, and it didn&apos;t see an international market launch, making the potential global debut of a white OnePlus 12 all the more interesting.</p><p>Where and when the Glacial White will make its debut outside China remains to be seen.

<ul><li>A discovery in the main Google app shows the company's plans to bring a YouTube Music extension to Gemini.</li><li>The extension may let users ask the bot to find songs based on their mood, playlists, history, and more.</li><li>A previous leak in the Gemini for Android app showed Google is bringing a "Music" option to let users choose which services it draws its information from.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A discovery in the main Google app suggests that its Gemini chatbot is preparing to integrate YouTube Music into the app.</p><p>According to information from AssembleDebug, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-google-gemini-extension-coming-soon-3440153/">Android Authority</a> states version 15.17.28.29.arm64 of the main Google app teases a YouTube Music extension. The early preview shows Google&apos;s description of the add-on, which reads, "play, search, and discover your favorite songs, artists, playlists, and more."</p><p>When communicating with Gemini in the Google app, the tipster found that users can ask the bot to play songs or radio based on their mood. When stating you&apos;re in an "upbeat and energetic mood," it seems Gemini will respond with three suggestions.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that this early preview responded with music compilations and not individual titles.</p><p>Moreover, Gemini may offer a link to a YouTube Music radio station that fits your criteria if desired. Tapping on any of the links is said to launch the YouTube Music app with your chosen piece of content readily available to play.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:821px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.08%;"><img id="Fo2wxruaDeDtcrSyv4U74T" name="youtube-music-gemini-extension-leaked-look.jpg" alt="A supposed early look at Gemini's upcoming YouTube Music extension." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fo2wxruaDeDtcrSyv4U74T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="821" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When installed, a permissions screen was discovered, detailing that YouTube Music&apos;s extension will pull data from your playlists, history, and preferences. It also advises users that some of their information will be shared with the streaming platform to "improve its services and personalize" their experience.</p><p>Within the code, the YouTube Music extension for Gemini will continue to work without the music platform&apos;s app installed. The tipster noticed that tapping on a link will open YouTube Music&apos;s web variant if the app isn&apos;t installed on a device.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans to debut its music extension in Gemini. However, considering how far it has progressed, it could arrive sooner rather than later.</p><p>Before Google swapped Bard for Gemini, the company unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bard-connects-to-google-apps-and-services">a slew of extensions</a> for the AI chatbot last September. These add-ons supercharged the bot, allowing it to draw real-time information from a user&apos;s connected apps, such as Maps, YouTube, Hotels, and Flights.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-assistant-app-testing-music-streaming-setting">previous Gemini leak</a> showed that users could soon gain the option to decide which music streaming service they prefer the bot to pull data from. This will likely be done through the "Music" option in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini&apos;s settings</a> once it arrives. Users can likely use this as an alternative as there&apos;s a chance that Spotify will appear there for quick AI assistance.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hjJAUFo8w8cUvGi5GmXmzg" name="oneplus-12-vs-iphone-15-pro-max-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjJAUFo8w8cUvGi5GmXmzg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of people have asked:</p><p><em><strong>Which is more secure — Android or iOS?</strong></em></p>
<p>A lot of the questions I get are about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-remove-malware-from-phone">malware</a> (and how to avoid it), mobile security, privacy, and which phones do it best. Most of them are basically asking the same thing — which is more secure?</p><p>You might think this is an easy one-word answer, but it&apos;s not because nothing about Android is easy or simple regarding how it&apos;s made or created. Android isn&apos;t what you think it is.</p>
<p>Android starts as a bunch of lines of code that anyone — even you — can download and compile to make an operating system. It&apos;s fairly complete, providing everything you need to connect to a wireless network and use a platform for other applications.</p><p>It&apos;s very secure and acts as the base for the most secure operating systems available that you might not know about; operating systems like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://grapheneos.org/">Graphene</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://copperhead.co/android/">Copperhead</a> are built using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Technically, this isn&apos;t Android. Android is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/brand-guidelines">a trademarked name</a> "owned" by Google, and to use it as a description for your product requires compliance with the A<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility">ndroid Compatibility Program</a>. Google makes this clear, saying "<em>The use of the "Android" trademark on hardware, packaging or marketing materials of the device is restricted to Android-compatible devices only.</em>"</p><p>If you ignore these details and say that any operating system based on the original code is Android, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security">Android is more secure</a> and private than iOS. But you probably should consider these operating systems more of a specialty for enthusiasts versus a regular consumer product. Maybe that should change, but companies with deep pockets aren&apos;t going to let that happen easily.</p>
<p>So, back to square one: Which is more secure, Android or iOS? I&apos;m going to say iOS, but for one specific reason—there is only one iOS, while there are hundreds of different types of Android, each with its unique services and exploits in addition to the potential security flaws in "Android" itself. </p><p>This is me being pedantic. Out of the box, there isn&apos;t any practical difference between an iPhone and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy phone</a> when it comes to security. Both have flaws, and when those flaws are found, both are promptly patched. As long as you keep your software up to date, either will serve you well.</p>
<p>That&apos;s not the end of the conversation, though, because you will install other applications on your phone. Apps can make even the most secure phone "unsafe," and we see that all the time on both Android and iOS. Apple and Google do a good job keeping bad apps out of their stores, and tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Google Play Protect</a> help a lot, but it still happens. My advice is only to install apps you trust, from developers you trust, sourced from a place you trust. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-needs-to-do-sideloading-right">Sideloading</a> willy-nilly can ruin even an ultra-secure phone.</p>
<h2 id="don-apos-t-forget-about-privacy-2">Don&apos;t forget about privacy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VMwhQjhhccVMDDkifUPED7" name="Google-Pixel-6-pro-privacy-dashboard.jpg" alt="Pixel 6 Pro Privacy Dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VMwhQjhhccVMDDkifUPED7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One last thing that usually gets left out of these conversations is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/security-not-privacy-and-you-can-have-one-without-other">security is not privacy</a> and it&apos;s possible to have one without the other. I&apos;ll start by saying Apple is more private, but not for the reasons you think.</p><p>Apple collects all sorts of information about you whenever you use an iPhone or iPad, just like Google or Samsung does. Certainly, more than you would be comfortable with once you know it&apos;s happening. The difference is that Apple seemingly doesn&apos;t do anything with it.</p>
<p>Google uses this information to try to sell you things. It tracks you, builds a profile about you, and references it to show you the "right" ads. It works, and Google makes a lot of money because it can do this better than other companies that do the same thing, like Amazon or Walmart.</p><p>Apple holds this information and probably only uses it to determine what to work on next. If Apple sees everyone using one particular feature, it knows to keep working on ways to improve it. It also knows which features everyone puts in a trash folder on the home screen. This sort of information tells Apple how to allocate future resources. Google and companies like Samsung do this, too, and it&apos;s a mostly harmless collection of data.</p>
<p>Still, Apple is collecting it, and you should know about it. You shouldn&apos;t be surprised because every other company that makes connected devices or services is doing the same. I feel that Google&apos;s use of your data for profit is just more intrusive, even if the company is quick to tell us that no people are doing any of the tracking and that it&apos;s all done by computers and algorithms.</p>
<p>In the end, you&apos;re safe to consider one just as secure as the other as long as you&apos;re willing to keep your phone&apos;s software up to date and be sensible when it comes to installing apps.</p><p>Buy whichever you like the best!</p>

<hr>
<p>Whispers are cropping up about Samsung&apos;s next major release of One UI 6.1 to a few of its older generation devices later this month.</p><p>The rumor stems from X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1786497332390858911">TheOneCID</a>, who states the One UI 6.1 update is preparing to arrive on the Galaxy S21 FE, Galaxy A53, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review">A54</a> in May (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/circle-may-14-calendar-own-midrange-samsung-phone/">Android Police</a>). They add that the update could arrive on May 14 in Canada, though that is its expected date after an expected international rollout.</p><p>It&apos;s assumed that Samsung could start updating these older devices in South Korea and Europe sometime before that date.</p><p>Comments dipped into discussions about which features these devices would pick up, and it seems the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe">Galaxy S21 FE</a> is only in line for one. Speculation states the old budget device could pick up Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> as its only Galaxy AI-oriented feature. It&apos;s worth remembering that Samsung mentioned how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">hardware-heavy</a> its Galaxy AI features are, so that&apos;s likely factoring into these suspicions.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem as though Samsung will bring any Galaxy AI tools to its mid-range devices. As the publication noted, One UI 6.1 contained enhancements beyond on-device AI, like battery controls, usability improvements, and more, to smoothen its software.</p><p>It&apos;s still early, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see exactly what Samsung has in store for these older budget devices.</p>

<p>While Samsung&apos;s older mid-range device owners wait for One UI 6.1, those with a Galaxy S22 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-owners-may-have-to-wait-for-the-one-ui-61-update-a-bit-longer">are <em>still</em> waiting</a>. The company had to reportedly pause its rollout of the update on the series due to some severe screen glitches. The problems were said to have locked users out of their devices as the screen turned white and remained that way.</p><p>It seems that a few older devices like the Galaxy S21, Flip 4, and Fold 4 have taken the update without issue. So, for now, the Galaxy S22 is back in the waiting room as Samsung sorts out the unruly problems. The Galaxy S23 encountered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-touchscreen-issue-fix-one-ui-61">some display problems</a>, however, those followed <em>after </em>its One UI 6.1 update due to an apparent problem with Google Discover.</p><p>Samsung started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">Galaxy AI-packed One UI software</a> to a few past-gen devices toward the end of March. The number of features may vary, but those that can handle it picked up Circle to Search, Live Translate, Chat Assist, and Generative Edit.</p>

<ul><li>The latest version of the Data Restore Tool app spills details surrounding Google's apparent development of a new process to speed up data transfers and restoration.</li><li>It seems Google will combine its physical cable method with a user's Wi-Fi to get the job done.</li><li>Additionally, the code shows a new "Restore Anytime" feature is in the works, which would let users restore the data of an old Android device without factory resetting.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information in Android&apos;s code seemingly points towards Google&apos;s development of faster device-to-device transfer speeds when setting up a new phone.</p><p>Seeds in the code were spotted by AssembleDebug in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-new-data-transfer-restore-methods-3440006/">Android Authority</a> in version 1.0.624 of the Data Restore Tool app. A couple of strings in the code tease this new capability with one acting as a tagline teaser stating, "want to speed things up?" A second string says, "copying using cable and Wi-Fi for faster speed."</p><p>This is apparently wrapped in a new "process" Google is preparing to implement called "MultiTransportD2dTransport." The tipster suggests the ability to use a cable, <em>and </em>Wi-Fi will work with data transfers and restoration.</p><p>Moreover, the company is supposedly planning to introduce a new feature for the Data Restore Tool app called "Restore Anytime." AssembleDebug states this feature will allow users to restore the data of an old Android device without needing to factory reset. However, users are seemingly limited in transferring data from the same device they&apos;ve used previously.</p><p>Attempting to switch the device you&apos;re obtaining data from will require a full data wipe on the device receiving the information. Additionally, an early discovered splash page says Google plans for a user&apos;s settings to remain unchanged during a data merge.</p><p>The page states users can choose what gets copied, such as messages, photos, contacts, and "more."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.88%;"><img id="PYWD9bEAVgQGmpJpZqZxTV" name="google-data-restore-tool-app-restore-anytime-splash-spotted.jpg" alt="A supposed splash page for Google's upcoming "Restore Anytime" feature for the Data Restore Tool app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PYWD9bEAVgQGmpJpZqZxTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="268" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Currently, it&apos;s unclear when Google plans to roll out the faster data transfer process and the "Restore Anytime" feature.</p><p>The Data Restore Tool app advises users to find and connect the appropriate cable to both devices before the transfer begins. This new process should speed things up as Google seeks to combine a user&apos;s WiFi connection with the physical cables for files, apps, and more.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is progressing with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a>, which prepares us for the company&apos;s next feature drop. The last beta was chock full of bug fixes as Google sought to address crashes, hiccups, freezing, and a few unsavory charging problems.</p>

<hr>
<p>As we near the launch of the Xperia 1 VI flagship smartphone from Sony, we are starting to see more and more prominent leaks of the handset as new marketing images pop up — thanks to Evan Blass.</p><p>Blass took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the official images of the Xperia 1 VI, which showcase the device in almost all angles. Per the marketing renders, the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship</a> from Sony is incorporating a textured finish on the back and also across the middle frame.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">X1mVI pic.twitter.com/sZRPlWT8ZL<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1786907825823703471">May 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The rear also includes a triple camera setup (based on ZEISS), which is the specs uncovered last week in a new leak.

<ul><li>Epic won an antitrust case against Google in a shocking jury verdict at the end of last year, and now Google and Epic both have the chance to tell the courts how they'd like to move forward.</li><li>Unsurprisingly, Epic announced an exhaustive lists of demands that would blow the Google Play Store right open.</li><li>Now, Google has countered with a statement and isn't happy with Epic's proposals.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic has been on a years-long quest to avoid paying fees on mobile platforms and gain the unabridged right to offer alternative payment methods for in-app purchases. Though the company largely lost its lawsuit against Apple, the opposite happened in its case against Google. In an unexpected jury verdict in December 2023, it was determined that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">Google has a monopoly on app distribution</a> on Android. So, what comes next?</p><p>Though Epic won its case, the situation is far from over. First, Epic had to tell the court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-wants-google-play-store-open">what it wanted a resolution to look like</a>. Then, Google had a chance to respond by May 2 with its own filing, and the company did so last week. Later this month, a hearing scheduled for May 23 will see each side make their case in front of a judge with expert testimonies. A final decision from the court is certain to come later than that. </p><p>Google still plans to challenge the original verdict, but its latest court filing tells us what it thinks about Epic&apos;s demands. In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/google-dubs-epics-demands-from-its-antitrust-win-unnecessary-and-far-beyond-the-scope-of-verdict/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, Google&apos;s vice president of Government Affairs & Public Policy, Wilson White, called Epic&apos;s asks "unnecessary" and "far beyond the scope of the recent U.S. trial verdict."</p><p>While Epic did win the case, the court&apos;s opinion on the injunctions filed by Epic and Google will determine what the game developer <em>actually</em> won. The positions held by both companies are entirely expected, and it&apos;s doubtful that either Epic and Google think that the courts will completely side with them. What will likely happen is that presiding Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California will find a middle ground between the two companies. </p>
<h2 id="what-epic-asked-for-and-why-it-makes-sense-2">What Epic asked for, and why it makes sense</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rbQUuynpzxvtDQcTXhPEUn" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-gaming-razer-kishi-v2-fortnite.jpg" alt="Playing Fortnite on a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra using a Razer Kishi V2 controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbQUuynpzxvtDQcTXhPEUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The changes that Epic wants to see on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a> are far-reaching and would create a completely different environment than the one we see today. It might be easy to laugh at Epic&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epics-remedy-following-google-case-jury-verdict" target="_blank">proposed remedy</a>, but it makes complete sense. In a negotiation, you always ask for more than you think you&apos;ll get. That way, when concessions are made, you&apos;ll end up with more than you would have if you started out at what might be considered more reasonable and fair. </p><p>Of course, Epic could also end up getting everything it asked for. After all, few experts and analysts expected Epic to come away with a victory against Google in the first place. If you&apos;re at the helm of Epic, why not try for absolutely everything you can and see what you come away with? </p><p>A high-level overview of what Epic is asking for is complete parity between the experience of downloading apps through the first-party Google Play Store, third-party app marketplaces, and sideloading. There&apos;s a full 16 pages of demands, but it all boils down to that central point.</p><p>Epic wants Google to remove Android warnings that push users away from downloading apps from alternate sources and cease exclusivity deals with developers. It also wants to bar Google from offering exclusive features that other developers can&apos;t, like integration with Google products and services.</p>
<h2 id="google-apos-s-rebuttal-isn-apos-t-wrong-either-2">Google&apos;s rebuttal isn&apos;t wrong, either</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also can&apos;t blame Google for countering with its alternative viewpoint, which appears to be a bit more fair than Epic&apos;s, although that&apos;s all up to interpretation. </p><p>"Epic&apos;s demands would harm the privacy, security, and overall experience of consumers, developers, and device manufacturers," said White, on behalf of Google, in a statement.</p><p> "Not only does their proposal go far beyond the scope of the recent U.S. trial verdict — which we will be challenging — it&apos;s also unnecessary due to the settlement we reached last year with state attorneys general from every state and multiple territories," he continued.</p><p>"We will continue to vigorously defend our right to a sustainable business model that enables us to keep people safe, partner with developers to innovate and grow their businesses, and maintain a thriving Android ecosystem for everyone."</p><p>Google tells the court in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/myvmkzlyyvr/Google%20objections%20to%20Epic%20-%2020240502.pdf">filing</a> that Epic&apos;s proposed changes, specifically around third-party app stores, would limit its ability to protect users&apos; privacy and security. Additionally, it says that Epic&apos;s asks would force it to tell third-party app marketplaces the list of apps users have already installed, potentially putting users in a compromising position. This could be devastating for users since governments in the U.S. are already using users&apos; installed apps to investigate or prosecute them.</p><p>Finally, Google argues that some of Epic&apos;s demands are redundant due to a previous settlement the company made in a case with some U.S. state attorneys general. This deal eliminates expansive Google Play Store exclusivity deals but still gives Google the opportunity to make smaller exclusivity agreements within apps. Google says Epic&apos;s ask to remove exclusivity deals altogether would limit developer opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-final-ruling-look-like-2">What does a final ruling look like?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y5gPxJ4PEi9iLuC7vkPEU4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Book-3-Ultra-playing-fortnite.jpg" alt="Playing Fortnite on a Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5gPxJ4PEi9iLuC7vkPEU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Epic and Google are clearly at odds, and that&apos;s to be expected. After a review process, Judge Donato will likely create a final verdict that differs from both companies&apos; proposed injunctions. We don&apos;t know what that might look like right now, but we may get a better idea following the May 23 hearing, where both sides will make their cases. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="5vkVkJTK62sYNBWrJ7cGgG" name="Epic-Games-Store-Mobile.jpg" alt="The Epic Games store on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vkVkJTK62sYNBWrJ7cGgG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Epic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We do know that however the result shakes out, Epic is pushing alternative app marketplaces on Android. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">Epic Games Store is coming to Android</a> later this year, regardless of the verdict in this case. However, if the court sides with Epic more than Google, the Epic Games Store might have a better chance to compete with the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>Apps that track your fitness with Google Fit will need an upgrade by next summer, as Google is moving to a new system called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>.</p><p>Google effectively began phasing out Fit&apos;s developer APIs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/health-connect-platform-google-samsung">launch of Health Connect in 2022</a>. Google Fit used to be the primary health platform until the company started transitioning to Health Connect, also referred to as the Android Health platform.</p><p>Google announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/evolving-health-on-android-migrating-from-google-fit-apis-to-android-health.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> that it is giving developers until June 30, 2025, to switch over to Health Connect (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/04/google-fit-api-shutdown/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The Google Fit APIs, including the REST API, will be available until that date, "giving developers ample time to migrate to Android Health."</p><p>This means that Google is no longer accepting new sign-ups for API access. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-apps-android">Fitness and workout apps</a> that used to rely on Google Fit now need to switch to Health Connect before the deadline.</p><p>Google&apos;s move to phase out the Fit APIs has sparked concerns among developers. Although Google has provided a transition guide, it hasn&apos;t introduced a substitute for the Goals API, which lets users set daily goals for steps and heart points.</p><p>Google I/O <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">is just around the corner</a> (it starts May 14), and health is a hot topic. With the company phasing out Google Fit APIs in favor of Health Connect, we can definitely expect to hear more about how it envisions the future of health and fitness within its ecosystem of devices and apps.</p><p>That said, it&apos;s unclear what&apos;s next for the Google Fit app itself on Android, Wear OS, and iOS. For now, the apps seem to keep working as activity trackers and data holders on those platforms.</p><p>Interestingly, the Google Fit app hasn&apos;t seen any significant updates lately. The last big update was just adding Health Connect support back in 2022. This adds to the mystery surrounding the app&apos;s future.</p><p>With Google Fit APIs going away and the Fitbit app being the default health app on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>, it certainly looks like Google sees Fitbit as its main player for health tracking. A single, unified system through Fitbit would definitely simplify things for the tech giant.</p>
