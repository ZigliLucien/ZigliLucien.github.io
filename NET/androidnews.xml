<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Users can now quickly report Gboard glitches with a simple tap using the "Quality Bug Report" shortcut.</li><li>The feature is currently rolling out in the latest Gboard beta release for various Android phone models, indicating a broader availability soon.</li><li>Previously, reporting bugs required navigating through settings, but now it's just two taps or a single press with the shortcut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>You can now snitch on annoying Gboard glitches with a super quick tap.</p><p>The latest addition to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-keyboard-android">keyboard app</a> is a new "Quality Bug Report" shortcut, allowing users to give feedback directly to the Gboard team more easily than before, as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/gboard-quality-bug-report/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>This new feature is now being rolled out in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a> beta release for various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> models, including the Pixel phones, the Galaxy S22 series or later, and even Chinese models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-note-40-series-launch">recently launched Infinix Note 40 series</a>. This suggests a wider rollout, and it should be available for everyone soon.</p><p>Before, reporting bugs meant navigating through Gboard settings to reach <em>Help & feedback</em>, then <em>Send feedback</em>. Now, it&apos;ll only require two taps by default, or even quicker with a single press if you drag "Quality Bug Report" to the shortcuts toolbar.</p><p>If you&apos;re not part of the beta program but still want to report an issue or suggest something to Google about Gboard, you&apos;ll have to go through the aforementioned steps.</p><p>Once this beta feature goes public, the entire process will speed up for everyone. When you submit a report, the system will automatically add "Quality bug report:" to the start of your feedback. This handy tag helps Google&apos;s team quickly sift through and tackle user-raised issues.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UGREEN is known for its GaN chargers and power banks, and over the last 12 months the Chinese manufacturer branched out into docking stations, power stations, and a variety of accessories. Now, UGREEN is making its debut into what is possibly its most ambitious category yet: NAS servers.</p><p>Dubbed the NASync series, UGREEN is rolling out six models at launch: a 2-bay DXP2800, 4-bay DXP4800 and DXP4800 Plus (which I&apos;m reviewing), a 6-bay DXP6800 Pro, an 8-bay DXP8800 Plus, and a 4-bay DXP480T Plus that uses all-flash storage. The 2-bay and 4-bay models are aimed at home users, with the 6-bay and 8-bay servers targeted at businesses and enthusiast users. I&apos;ll get to the Pro models a little later, and considering they have Intel Core i5 hardware, there&apos;s clearly a lot on offer.</p><p>But right now, it&apos;s the DXP4800 Plus that stands out in the brand&apos;s portfolio. This 4-bay NAS is powered by the Intel&apos;s Alder Lake-based Pentium Gold 8505, comes with 8GB of RAM as standard, has a 128GB SSD installed out of the box, and has four HDD drive bays in addition to two M.2 slots. And there&apos;s a 10GbE port along with a 2.5GbE port at the back, and there really isn&apos;t much missing on the hardware side of things.</p><p>What you&apos;ll really like is the pricing; UGREEN is taking the unconventional route of crowdfunding, and the DXP4800 Plus can be bought for just $419 as a result. I can&apos;t think of another 4-bay NAS with this caliber of hardware that&apos;s available for under $550, and while there&apos;s usually a downside to backing a relative unknown brand, UGREEN has its bases covered.</p><p>I used the DXP4800 Plus for just over two weeks, and here&apos;s why you should consider the NAS server if you&apos;re looking to upgrade. </p>

<p>UGREEN unveiled the NASync series on March 26, and the products are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urgreen/ugreen-nasync-next-level-storage-limitless-possibilities">now available on Kickstarter</a>. You can back the DXP4800 Plus for $419, and UGREEN mentions that the retail model will debut at $699 once it starts selling on its website and Amazon.</p><p>There&apos;s a standard DXP4800 that is powered by the Intel N100 platform, and it comes with the same four drive bays and two NVMe slots, but you get dual 2.5GbE ports instead. There&apos;s 8GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, and the same set of ports as the Plus model. The DXP4800 is going for $359, and it will cost $599 at retail.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ugreen-dxp4800-plus-design"><span>UGREEN DXP4800 Plus: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CLxKWFDiAhVmH7egfDLC3g" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-2.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CLxKWFDiAhVmH7egfDLC3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UGREEN&apos;s products have a distinct design aesthetic, with the brand favoring a metallic grey color scheme. The DXP4800 Plus has a similar aesthetic, and it ends up looking elegant. The chassis is made out of aluminum, and it is clearly built to last — it has a reassuring heft to it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z5ZgEnppNT3zy74kFFZA5h" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-8.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z5ZgEnppNT3zy74kFFZA5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would have liked to see vented sides to deliver passive airflow, but other than that quibble, I don&apos;t have any issues on the design front. The drive trays are numbered, and there&apos;s a single fan at the back that&apos;s covered by a dust filter. While most NAS servers use this fan as the exhaust, it works as an intake on the DXP4800 Plus, with hot air blowing out the front in between the drive trays. The fan itself is quiet, and it isn&apos;t audible even when the NAS is under load; the HDDs are noisier by some margin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4bVxAzTyawcB4aKhkVuFEh" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-9.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bVxAzTyawcB4aKhkVuFEh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about HDDs, the DXP4800 Plus has four drive bays, and you can easily install 3.5-inch drives without any tools. UGREEN has a pretty cool mechanism that uses a lever to extend the height of the drive tray, allowing you to slot in an HDD. It is an overengineered solution to a problem that didn&apos;t need solving, but it looks cool nonetheless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KNvUdGN2NtoYCUxhjoE3Yh" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-10.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KNvUdGN2NtoYCUxhjoE3Yh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t see any slots for mounting a 2.5-inch SATA SSD, so if you&apos;re thinking of using flash storage, you&apos;ll need to rely on the dual M.2 slots that are located at the underside. The power button is located below the drive bays, and you get status LEDs next to it; there&apos;s also an SD card reader, a USB-C, and USB-A connectivity at the front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R79aTQ7bUQ89yicgJz97bg" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-5.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R79aTQ7bUQ89yicgJz97bg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s UGREEN branding on both sides, but it meshes into the design and is barely noticeable. On the whole, I think UGREEN did a great job with the design of the DXP4800 Plus, and the NAS server looks good and has excellent build quality.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ugreen-dxp4800-plus-connectivity-and-hardware"><span>UGREEN DXP4800 Plus: Connectivity and hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBypRNb4mGBRL4sjnbkvHk" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-12.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBypRNb4mGBRL4sjnbkvHk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to connectivity, there&apos;s plenty to like on the DXP4800 Plus. There are dual USB 2.0 ports along with a USB 3.2 port at the back, and you get an HDMI port that lets you connect the NAS to a TV. You can always stream media from the NAS via DLNA, but HDMI makes things easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sRDNYsb7tiSUrvPpgPwuhj" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-13.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRDNYsb7tiSUrvPpgPwuhj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The DXP4800 Plus has a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port alongside a 10 Gigabit port, and you don&apos;t really see many enclosures in this segment that have 10GbE connectivity. Like I said, there really isn&apos;t much missing in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cw9CC4W5jyTNunNSaLugzh" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-21.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cw9CC4W5jyTNunNSaLugzh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS comes with 8GB of RAM as standard, and there are two SO-DIMM slots on the underside, so you can easily add more memory should you wish to do so. The system is able to handle up to 64GB of RAM — 32GB in each slot — so there&apos;s no shortage of upgradability. You also get two M.2 2280 slots on the underside, and UGREEN bundled foam pads that do a good job managing thermals when you install an SSD.</p>
<p>You also get two Cat7 cables in the package, and that&apos;s an added bonus. The DXP4800 Plus is quite heavy on its own, but UGREEN uses an external power brick to drive the NAS.</p>

<p>As for the hardware, the DXP4800 Plus has what is arguably the best package in this segment. Intel&apos;s Pentium Gold 8505 is a tier above the Celeron N4125 and N5105 that&apos;s used in most NAS servers these days, and it has plenty of power to spare. As the software isn&apos;t quite ready just yet, I&apos;m not going to share detailed performance metrics — I&apos;ll do so in an update.</p>

<p>That said, I transferred several hundred Gigabytes of data to the NAS and used it with M.2 SSDs over my 10GbE home network, and it handled transfers just as well as other 10GbE NAS servers I tested. There were two instances where the SMB share failed to show up, but a reboot solved the issue.</p>

<p>UGREEN sent me the DXP4800 Plus two weeks ahead of its Kickstarter debut, and the brand mentioned that the software is still in beta. That&apos;s an understatement; there are many issues with the UI, and weird translation errors throughout the interface, and it isn&apos;t close to being ready for consumer use as of writing.</p>
<p>That said, the UI itself looks clean, and it&apos;s clear that UGREEN is trying to emulate DiskStation Manager. Synology is the brand to beat in this area, so it&apos;s good to see UGREEN trying to copy from the best. Considering the state of the software, I&apos;m not going into too much detail, but you get a settings page that lets you tweak the fan settings, add and change user accounts, set up storage pools, and so on.</p>
<p>There&apos;s remote access as well, and you need a UGREEN cloud account to access the NAS from outside your home network. However, there&apos;s no way to enable 2FA on the account, so I wouldn&apos;t suggest setting it up until that feature is live. Also, while I created an account and signed in on day one, I wasn&apos;t able to get back in the next day — I had to register again using the same email address.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.03%;"><img id="3vA5LRY9Rrrj7i8ywESota" name="ugos.jpg" alt="UGREEN DXP4800 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vA5LRY9Rrrj7i8ywESota.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2591" height="1400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no icon management on the home screen, and other than dragging the icons around, you can&apos;t change much. The package center doesn&apos;t have many utilities; the Universal Search does a good job indexing the data stored on the NAS and pulling up useful information, but there is no native Plex client as of writing, or Docker containerization.</p><p>You don&apos;t even get a built-in media or audio service, and UGREEN notes that these are being added. While I didn&apos;t have any issues creating a storage pool with Seagate IronWolf drives, I got an error message a few days later stating the drives are incompatible; UGREEN said it won&apos;t impose any limitations around HDD use, and that all NAS HDDs should work without any issues.</p><p>I&apos;ll revisit this section once UGREEN rolls out software updates to the NAS, but as of now, know that the DXP4800 Plus doesn&apos;t have much to offer from a software point of view.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5404T is a good choice if you want a 4-bay NAS with powerful hardware and the ability to transcode Plex content. It is powered by the Intel Celeron N5105 platform, has 4GB of RAM, four M.2 slots, and dual 2.5GbE connectivity. ASUSTOR made a lot of changes to its software in the last 12 months, and you get a good UI along with a ton of useful features. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-AS5404T-Quad-Core-2x2-5GbE-Attached/dp/B0C5M8RMMM">in at $529</a>, the AS5404T is costlier than the DXP4800 Plus, and you miss out on 10GbE connectivity.</p><p>If you need the best software features, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> is still a terrific choice. That said, the hardware is distinctly second-best; you only get Gigabit Ethernet ports, and while the Ryzen R1600 is plenty fast, it doesn&apos;t do transcodes. Retailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1735213-REG/synology_ds923_4_bay_nas_enclosure.html">for $599</a>, the DS923+ is considerably costlier, and while you don&apos;t get the best hardware, the software is why you&apos;re paying a premium.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best 4-bay NAS hardware</li><li>You need 10GbE connectivity</li><li>You want the convenience of HDD storage as well as M.2 slots</li><li>You need plenty of memory and an easy way to upgrade down the line</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a native Plex client and Docker out of the box</li><li>You need secure remote access</li></ul>
<p>Overall, UGREEN has a strong showing with its NASync series, and the DXP4800 Plus has the potential to be one of the best 4-bay NAS servers around. The hardware clearly is in a league of its own, and you don&apos;t get the same feature-set on any other $500 NAS today. The fact that it features an Intel 8505 platform along with 10GbE connectivity gives the DXP4800 Plus a distinct edge.</p><p>The build quality is on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best home NAS servers</a>, the enclosure is quiet in daily use, and 8GB of RAM is more than what you get in this segment. That said, UGREEN still needs to do a lot of work on the software front; there&apos;s no native Plex client or Docker containerization, and UGOS Pro is missing a built-in media and audio servers.</p><p>UGREEN clearly states that the software is in beta, and that it will roll out updates with new features in the coming weeks. I&apos;ll update this post once those features go live, but the little I&apos;ve seen on the software shows a lot of promise. While I&apos;m generally wary of recommending crowdfunded products, UGREEN is a brand with a proven history of delivering reliable products — I use its GaN chargers and docks throughout my home — so I&apos;m willing to recommend the DXP4800 Plus.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind waiting a few weeks for the software features, the DXP4800 Plus is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urgreen/ugreen-nasync-next-level-storage-limitless-possibilities">easy recommendation at $419</a> — there&apos;s nothing else in this segment that gives you as good a value.</p>

<ul><li>Google is striving to enhance physical keyboard support on Android, aiming for a desktop-like experience across all devices.</li><li>Android 15 Developer Preview 2 introduces three new accessibility options for physical keyboards: Sticky keys, Slow keys, and Bounce Keys.</li><li>Android 15 DP2 introduces the Slow Keys option, which allows users to customize the duration of key presses.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been improving physical keyboards on Android, aiming for a desktop-like experience on any device. The company might introduce new keyboard features in the next version of Android to continue working toward that goal.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-physical-keyboards-3427661/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dropped news about new keyboard features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> Developer Preview 2. Apparently, the latest release includes three accessibility options for physical keyboards: <em>Sticky keys</em>, <em>Slow keys</em>, and <em>Bounce keys</em>. Sticky and bounce keys were already spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2</a>, but the <em>Slow keys</em> option is brand new.</p><p>You can find the <em>Slow keys</em> option by heading to <strong>Settings</strong>, tapping on <strong>System</strong>, followed by <strong>Keyboard</strong>, and finally, <strong>Physical Keyboard</strong> under the <em>Accessibility section</em>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.55%;"><img id="eYH3cDVJF5u4ox9EA3jCk9" name="Android-15-physical-keyboard-features.jpg" alt="physical keyboard accessibility features in android 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eYH3cDVJF5u4ox9EA3jCk9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the <em>Slow keys</em> option, you can set how long you need to hold down a key before it registers. However, in Android 15 DP2, you can&apos;t tweak this duration just yet. Rahman, though, snooped around the latest preview&apos;s code and discovered that Google might allow for up to five seconds for this feature down the line.</p><p>As you might have guessed, when you turn on sticky keys and hit a modifier button like Alt, Ctrl, or Shift, it stays pressed down while you hit other keys. This makes it a breeze to press multiple keys at once for commands or to bang out keyboard shortcuts in rapid succession.</p><p>But with bounce keys, it stops you from registering super-fast presses of the same key.</p><p>These new options are a real game-changer for people with physical disabilities. Android 15 might make it way easier for them to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-keyboards-android-tablets">physical keyboard</a>, whether it&apos;s on their tablets or when their phones are in desktop mode.</p><p>Google is throwing these keyboard features into the mix as part of its plan to beef up Android and make it a serious rival to operating systems like Windows. Microsoft&apos;s desktop OS has been rocking these options for a while, so it&apos;s about time Android caught up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.55%;"><img id="rT25bumbYPyMG3ihu8Co4A" name="Android-15-physical-keyboard-preview.jpg" alt="Android 15 physical keyboard preview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rT25bumbYPyMG3ihu8Co4A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from the fresh accessibility features, Android 15 also rolls out previews for keyboard layouts right on the keyboard settings screen. This is a big win for non-English keyboard setups because you can now easily check which characters are mapped to each key.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 have appeared in the 3C Certification database, sporting the same 25W charging as last year.</li><li>Speculation claims that the devices could offer more speed, as regulators notably default to a 25W charger when inspecting Galaxy devices.</li><li>The Flip 6 has been rumored to feature a better cover display and more RAM, while rumors continue about a budget Fold 6.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor suggests, consumers interested in Samsung&apos;s upcoming foldables may be in for the same old, same old.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1772799264336605632">Abhishek Yadav</a> on X, Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 were spotted on the 3C Certification website with the charger model number EP-TA800. More importantly, their listing suggests Samsung will continue to feature 25W charging on both of its foldables this year.</p>

<p>However, there may be a bit of hope as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-certified-with-25w-charger/">SamMobile</a> notes that both foldables could arrive sporting swifter charging speeds. The publication states that a 25W charger is the default choice for regulator authorities when inspecting all of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy phones — tablets, too. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> were reportedly tested with a 25W charger but the device launched with support for 45W fast charging.</p><p>Only time will tell which way Samsung is interested in going.</p><p>For now, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-larger-dual-batteries-rumor">other rumors</a> regarding the clamshell and book-style foldable&apos;s battery, which state an increase in size could occur. In January, the Korean OEM was rumored to have started testing a Flip 6 with a 1,097mAh and 2,790mAh pairing, bringing its total to nearly 4,000mAh. This would bring the clamshell to a battery capacity akin to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>A capacity boost like this would give the Flip 6 a 300mAh advantage over last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the Flip 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">was rumored</a> to feature a smoother cover display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a higher RAM option. Speculation continues to swirl about a budget "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-fe-may-drop-this-key-feature-to-bring-the-price-down">Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE</a>" that may drop its stylus to keep the price low.

<ul><li>The Walt Disney Company announced the rollout of "Hulu on Disney Plus," available for all U.S.-based Disney Bundle subscribers.</li><li>The merge brings all of Hulu's content onto the Disney Plus app so users won't have to switch apps to find the shows/movies they're looking for.</li><li>The company states standalone Disney Plus/Hulu users will find the option to upgrade to a Bundle, which starts at $2 extra per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (Mar. 27), it was announced that Disney Bundle subscribers in the U.S. will now find "Hulu on Disney Plus" as its rollout begins.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.disneyplus.com/hulu-on-disney-plus-launches-today-in-the-us-for-bundle-subscribers">press release</a>, Hulu on Disney Plus merges both platforms&apos; streaming content libraries in one place. The company states subscribers will begin noticing Hulu titles, recommendations, sets, and collections on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> without switching apps. Disney hopes this brings a more customizable and personal experience for users viewing content on their platform.</p><p>Additionally, standalone Disney Plus subscribers will find Hulu&apos;s content available via "upsell options" across multiple devices. This means users will find a "convenient" way to upgrade their plans to the Disney Bundle, starting at $2 more monthly.</p><p>The post reiterates that Disney Bundle plans begin at $9.99 per month. It&apos;s worth mentioning that Hulu on Disney changes nothing; both services are still available on their own if consumers desire.</p><p>Disney urges users to create profiles for those who will be watching and to check their settings to ensure they&apos;re finding the content they care for most.</p><p>Joe Earley, president of direct-to-consumer at Disney Entertainment, said, "[the] official launch of Hulu on Disney+ gives viewers even more opportunities to easily discover and enjoy thousands of titles all in one place, underscoring the extraordinary value of the Disney Bundle."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Disney Plus is launching a new campaign to commemorate Hulu&apos;s inclusion, beginning with a brand-new logo. The company states the rollout will include a new Disney Plus intro color palette that mixes Hulu&apos;s green with the former&apos;s legacy blue.</p><p>Moreover, the orchestral mnemonic (the sound during its animation) was reimagined by Ludwig Göransson, an Academy Award-winning composer.</p><p>Disney is also launching campaigns across social media platforms, digital spots during broadcasts, and more for on-site locations at the Disneyland Resort.</p><p>Disney Plus and Hulu have been running this merger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-and-hulu-merger-app-rolling-out">in beta since November</a>, and its rollout today makes it official. Users should begin noticing the availability of Hulu content on the Disney Plus app with the option to upgrade to a Bundle as the day progresses.</p>

<p>It&apos;s no secret that Visible is one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">wireless carriers</a>, but we just learned that the Verizon-owned company has permanently improved its best plan to be an even better deal for customers. </p><p>Starting today, the Visible Plus plan will include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/plans"><strong>some new features</strong></a> to enhance your wireless experience, such as free smartwatch coverage (Apple Watch only, unfortunately) and one free Global Pass day every month. All of the existing talk, text, and perks will remain unchanged, and the price of the Visible Plus plan will remain just $45 per month. </p>

<p>In addition to all of the perks and outstanding coverage that made Visible Plus <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">our favorite unlimited plan</a>, Visible is now throwing in free smartwatch service, an upgraded mobile hotspot, and one Global Pass Day per month to the data plan at no additional cost. </p>
<p>Sure, the changes aren't particularly dramatic, but if you were on the fence about switching to Visible, maybe this update will help.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="80ffd6ac-5912-4da0-8b9b-ced55ecceca4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Visible Plus: $45 per month, including new plan enhancements" data-dimension48="Visible Plus: $45 per month, including new plan enhancements">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Here is everything that the March 2024 update adds to the Visible Plus plan:</p>
<h2 id="1-one-global-pass-day-per-month-2">1. One Global Pass day per month</h2>
<p>Powered by Verizon, the Global Pass can be activated in the Visible app at any time and gives users unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data across 140 countries worldwide. The 2024 update gives you one free Global Pass day per month, beyond which you can add more coverage by paying $10 per day. </p><p>The existing international features included in the Visible Plus plan — free calling in over 30 countries and texting in over 200 countries — will remain unchanged. </p>
<h2 id="2-increased-mobile-hotspot-speeds-2">2. Increased mobile hotspot speeds</h2>
<p>The Visible Plus plan already came with an unlimited mobile hotspot, but this update increases the data speeds from 5Mbps to 10Mbps at no additional cost.</p>
<h2 id="3-smartwatch-connectivity-apple-watch-only-2">3. Smartwatch connectivity (Apple Watch only)</h2>
<p>Although the March 2024 update doesn&apos;t benefit folks who own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, if you&apos;re a Visible user with an Apple Watch, your device service will now be covered by the Visible Plus plan (a $10 value). </p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a> (for example) looks great and is a great health tracker. They&apos;re miniaturized health trackers that pack a surprising amount of functionality. But how exactly do these compact devices work their magic? They can offer many of the same features of a smartwatch or fitness tracker but only a fraction of the size.</p><p>Let&apos;s have a look at the bits and bobs that make a smart ring work, transforming it from a simple piece of jewelry into a window for your health.</p>
<h2 id="tiny-sensors-big-data-2">Tiny sensors, big data</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3659px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-in-hand.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3659" height="2058" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lineup of very small sensors is at the heart of a smart ring. These miniaturized circuits and components gather a wealth of data about your body and surroundings. </p><p>You&apos;ll find the same sensors as you would in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>, but often smaller versions are used. Like other tech, these sensors can be more advanced and more accurate than their older, larger counterparts. They can also be more comfortable to wear, making them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">the ultimate sleep-tracking device</a>. Here are just some of the sensors you can find in a typical smart ring:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor:</strong> This shines a light through your skin to measure blood flow variations, allowing the ring to track your heart rate and blood oxygen levels.</li><li><strong>Accelerometer:</strong> Tracks your movement, counting steps, distance covered, and estimating calorie burn.</li><li><strong>Gyroscope:</strong> Works in tandem with the accelerometer for more precise motion detection, enhancing activity tracking.</li><li><strong>Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensor:</strong> Measures sweat production, providing insight into your stress level and emotional state.</li><li><strong>Peripheral Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) sensor:</strong> Estimates the amount of oxygen carried in your red blood cells.</li><li><strong>NTC thermistor sensor:</strong> Tracks changes in your body temperature.</li></ul>
<p>The type and number of sensors will vary depending on the ring&apos;s specific features, but this is a basic list you&apos;ll find in most wearables — smart rings included. Because of their small size, we might not see the same features found in other wearables, like GPS. Without a display of its own, this might not matter for certain features.</p><p>The collected data is no good on its own. That&apos;s where a microprocessor comes in. This tiny brain of the ring interprets the sensor readings, translating them into meaningful information. It also provides smart power management for the ring&apos;s battery and can power additional features like a haptic feedback motor that you may find on some models, which lets your ring vibrate on your finger.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-world-2">Connecting to the world</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WSjLDjSo2z7e4ATafr2yWE" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-updating.jpg" alt="Updating the Oura Ring (Gen 3)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSjLDjSo2z7e4ATafr2yWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3838" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings wouldn&apos;t be very smart without a way to communicate. Here&apos;s where wireless technologies come into play.</p><p>The most common type of connection allowing your ring to pair with your phone is Bluetooth. Data is transferred so you can access your health data, receive notifications, and even control some features of your phone.</p><p>NFC is a short-range technology that can provide several extremely useful features on some smart ring models, including tap-to-pay and digital access control. Having a ring replace debit or credit cards and things like keycards or transit passcards is mighty convenient. </p>
<p>Communicating and interacting with a smart ring is where things are different from other wearables, like a smartwatch, that have a display.</p><p>While you might find LED lights for visual cues, haptic feedback for sensory interaction, and even gesture control along the ring&apos;s outer body, a good smartphone is a requirement for the best experience.</p><p>An app is the primary interface for a smart ring, allowing you to view detailed health data, set health goals, and configure things like notifications through haptics and all the settings needed to make it work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3614px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T7GEEF4n6dD6LENm85Ca8F" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-charger.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T7GEEF4n6dD6LENm85Ca8F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3614" height="2033" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings are powered by the same type of battery as your phone or other wearable devices — like everything else, it&apos;s been miniaturized.</p><p>Their battery life — and lifespan — depend on the model and how you&apos;re using your device. An always-on connection and continuous health monitoring will drain the battery more than doing either intermittently, but they also have the benefit of not having to power a display, which means they can last a bit longer than a typical Android smartwatch, for example. Ideally, your ring&apos;s battery will last for several days or even more than a week, and you typically charge it using a wireless pad or connection included with the device.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-next-for-smart-rings-2">What&apos;s next for smart rings?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-silver-close.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart ring technology is still evolving, with exciting possibilities on the horizon. We might see some enhancement and refining of existing features alongside new ones.</p><p>I can see a future where smart rings better track your sleep, and your blood pressure and even monitor blood sugar levels. Because they usually offer a better fit than a watch and have full contact along the inner side a smart ring can be much more accurate than other wearables.</p><p>I also think we&apos;ll see more sophisticated gesture controls and smart home controls. Fine-tuned gesture control paired with NFC means controlling your lights or thermostat could be just a tap away.</p>
<p>Today, smart rings come in a variety of styles and functionalities. With Samsung ready to enter the market with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, expect to see plenty more smart rings offered from a wide array of tech companies.</p><p>They can do almost everything your smartwatch can and have the potential to do so much more. It feels like the smart ring might be the wearable tech of the future.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new batch of leaked renders claims to be the base Pixel 9 device, and there are rumors of Google&apos;s return to the "XL" category.</p><p>Together with OnLeaks on X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a> has posted several alleged renderings of the true base Pixel 9 device. The imaging purports that the Pixel 9 will sport a smaller 6.03-inch display. The device could launch with the following dimensions: 152.8 x 71.9 x 8.5mm with a potential 12mm bump due to its camera housing.</p><p>Speaking of its cameras, the Pixel 9&apos;s renderings show a housing change we&apos;ve seen previously. The upcoming series drops its full horizontal camera array for a pill-shaped look, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. The Pixel 9&apos;s imaging also suggests it will arrive with two cameras like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>The post adds the Pixel 9 may offer a completely flat display with four rounded corners around its frame. Consumers may find its physical buttons (power button and volume slider) on the right side of its body.</p><p>Additionally, it looks like Google will continue to offer a centered punch-hole selfie camera.</p>

<p>The publication and X-leaker OnLeaks have backtracked some previously leaked renders of the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro. In January, a batch of images leaked and were touted as the base Pixel 9, but information now suggests that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-renders-leak">it was the Pixel 9 Pro</a> with a 6.1-inch flat display. Another round of images surfaced in January, which were said to be the Pixel 9 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-render-leak">but OnLeaks claims</a> those were of a third model: the "Pixel 9 XL."</p><p>If the rumors are true, consumers will experience a smaller Pixel series in 2024. The Pixel 9 Pro will drop by 0.6 inches, moving from a 6.7-inch display to 6.1 inches. This supposed Pixel 9 XL would take the top spot with a 6.5-inch display, but it&apos;s still smaller than 2023&apos;s Pro model. Much of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-display-rumor">goes against rumors</a> that claimed Google would go bigger in 2024.</p><p>In their respective leaked renderings, both the Pixel 9 Pro and the newly rumored Pixel 9 XL featured a triple camera array. The end of March is approaching, meaning we should take these rumors with a pinch of salt until Google&apos;s teasers later this year.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Google Pixel 9 series was recently rumored to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-could-bring-adaptive-touch-feature">enhanced touch sensitivity</a>. The feature would arrive as "Adaptive Touch" and enable the devices to automatically adjust their touch screen sensitivity based on environmental conditions like rain.</p>

<ul><li>Last year's rollout of the webcam feature for Pixel phones with Android 14 QPR1 fell short in image quality, but Google seems to be addressing this shortcoming for the next Android version.</li><li>The latest Android 15 Developer Preview introduces a High-Quality mode for the webcam.</li><li>While the HQ mode may impact battery life, the noticeable improvement in video quality could make it worthwhile for tasks like video streaming.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to be working on beefing up Android&apos;s built-in webcam feature to match Apple&apos;s <em>Continuity Camera</em> quality.</p><p>Last year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr-beta-webcam-feature-video-quality">rolled out a webcam feature for Pixel phones</a>, kicking off with Android 14 QPR1. Though it sounded promising, the actual image quality when using it on an Android device often fell short. However, Google appears to have listened to user feedback and is working on improving it for the next Android version.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">latest Android 15 Developer Preview release</a>, Google has thrown in a fresh HQ button for the webcam, as spotted by Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-webcam-high-quality-mode-3427591/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. It&apos;s located in the top-left corner of the viewfinder, and tapping that button brings up <em>High Quality</em> mode, ramping up the video quality big time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:332px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.89%;"><img id="DapMMSiJBDvaaQA944ztqm" name="Android-webcam-HQ-mode.jpg" alt="HQ button in Android's built-in webcam interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DapMMSiJBDvaaQA944ztqm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="332" height="740" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The feature does that by flicking off Google&apos;s power optimizations behind the scenes. According to Rahman&apos;s experiments, the Pixel phone seems to be pumping out video streams in Full HD at 30 frames per second.</p><p>Based on his testing, the video quality doesn&apos;t seem to be munching away at the phone&apos;s battery life. Plus, even after a solid 2.5-hour grind, Rahman didn&apos;t notice his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> breaking a sweat and overheating.</p><p>Of course, diving into HQ Mode is bound to nibble on your battery life, so if you&apos;re planning a marathon video session, it might be wise to leave it off to save juice. But Rahman suggests that for specific tasks like streaming video, it could be worth flipping the switch because the boost in video quality is pretty darn noticeable.</p><p>This could be a game changer for users keen on capturing higher-quality video content without breaking the bank. Instead of shelling out for a pricey webcam, you can tap into your phone&apos;s potential and save yourself some cash.</p><p>It&apos;s nice to see Google fixing a big issue with Pixel phone webcams. But remember, this feature is only in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> developer preview. While we&apos;re hopeful it&apos;ll stick around for the final build, there&apos;s always a chance it could pull a disappearing act, as we&apos;ve seen happen before with Android beta features.</p><p>Once Android 15 hits the stable channel, we&apos;ll have to wait and see if this stays for the long haul.</p>

<ul><li>Users in the U.S. can now have a personalized shopping experience — thanks to Google.</li><li>The search giant is bringing nifty new features to Google Search on mobile, desktop, and the app.</li><li>It will include style recommendations, an AI-powered image generation tool, and a virtual try-on option.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google wants to make your shopping experience more personalized by introducing new tools, the search giant announced today (Mar.27).</p><p>Users in the U.S. who usually use mobile browsers or the Google app to shop for apparel or accessories will now see a new section dubbed "style recommendations."</p><p>It will have various options to choose from and rate with a thumbs up or thumbs down button. Users can further swipe right or left to see their personalized results. Google says more options will be provided when users don&apos;t find what they are looking for, and they can keep on the search.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:292px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:205.48%;"><img id="XSZ84GHToJkfBhiXaMhRZR" name="Google-Shopping-Style-Picking-Tool.gif" alt="Google Shopping Style Pick tool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSZ84GHToJkfBhiXaMhRZR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="292" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google will remember these preferences, and the next time users search for the same set of accessories/apparel, they will get personalized results based on the saved preferences. If  any accidental taps occur, users can tap on three dots next to the Search result and "look for personalization options in the "About this result" panel."</p><p>Additionally, Google allows U.S. shoppers to specify brands they like when choosing apparel, shoes, or accessories on mobile, desktop, and the Google app. Once they choose their brands, the subsequent search results will showcase products from those brands first. As mentioned, they can still change their preferences in the aforementioned process.</p><p>Users in the U.S. who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-search-generative-ai-holiday-gifts/#:~:text=Shop%20what%E2%80%99s%20(literally)%20on%20your%20mind">opted for</a> Search Generative Experience (SGE) via Search Labs will have access to a new experimental feature on the Google app and mobile browsers. It is an AI-powered image generation for shopping tool that allows users to find their favorite products based on their search query. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1227px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.90%;"><img id="jUko56SQrmahFNLgchXXMT" name="google-shopping-ai-tool.jpg" alt="Google Shopping AI tool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUko56SQrmahFNLgchXXMT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1227" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google cites examples like the "colorful quilted spring jacket" search query, which showcases photorealistic images that match users&apos; ideas. Once the images are generated, they can select and view suitable options by scrolling through them. </p><p>After finding the right one, the search giant is offering shoppers a virtual try-on (VTO) tool. The tool was first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-clothes-virtual-try-on">introduced</a> last year for U.S. users shopping on desktop, mobile, or the Google app. The tool provides a diverse set of models, including sizes ranging from XXS to 4XL. Users can look for the "try-on" icon in shopping results to check out the men&apos;s or women&apos;s tops.</p>
