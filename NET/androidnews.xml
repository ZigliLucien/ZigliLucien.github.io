<p>YouTube Music is adding a feature to showcase your personalized radio on your profile and channel, alongside your top songs, artists, music videos, and playlists.</p><p>According to Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1enphjl/yt_music_is_slowly_adding_social_features/" target="_blank">Rolan_Albarico</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> is rolling out a shareable personal radio feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/10/youtube-music-personal-radio/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This playlist, updated daily and pinned to your profile, is said to reflect your latest listening habits and musical tastes.</p><p>YouTube Music&apos;s customizable profiles, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/13407991?visit_id=638590584419707655-3959287141&rd" target="_blank">launched in April of last year</a>, let users highlight their top songs, artists, playlists, and videos. Now, the platform is adding a new twist in the form of a shareable personal radio.</p><p>This playlist can be shared with others via a link or added to your library.

<p>It’s a fresh way to showcase and share your evolving music tastes.</p><p>YouTube Music&apos;s shareable personal radio appears to be rolling out in stages. When it’s available for you, just go to your profile settings and find "Privacy and location" under "Channel settings." Then, flip the switch for "Enable public stats" or "Enable public personal radio" to start sharing your personalized radio station.</p><p>Unlike collaborative playlists that mix tastes from multiple users, YouTube Music&apos;s new personal radio is all about you. It zeroes in on your own listening history to create a music stream that&apos;s the perfect match for your specific tastes.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming</a> world is a real battleground, with YouTube Music, Spotify, and Apple Music constantly vying for the top spot. These platforms are always innovating, copying each other’s best features, and trying to one-up each other to win and keep users.</p><p>But if you love sharing your music tastes with friends, YouTube Music’s upcoming personal radio might be a game-changer.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is gearing up for its next device launch, probably in October.</li><li>The Galaxy S24 FE is fully leaked, revealing display and camera specs ahead of the anticipated launch.</li><li>The device will have a triple camera setup, look a lot like Galaxy S24, and will likely be powered by an Exynos 2400e chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Samsung&apos;s major Galaxy flagship launches wrapped up for the year, the next big thing to watch for is a Fan Edition. The rumored Galaxy S24 FE just got fully revealed, thanks to a new leak.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-specs-features">Android Headlines</a> obtained a bunch of renders for the Galaxy S24 FE&apos;s marketing materials, showing off the device, its colors, and most of the specs. At first glance, it looks similar to the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, featuring flat edges, rounded corners, and the familiar triple camera setup on the back. But this time, the colors seem to stand out as different in the renders.</p>

<p>The upcoming Fan Edition phone might come in shades of blue, black, silver, green, and yellow, giving users plenty of options to choose from. According to the marketing materials, the Galaxy S24 FE will feature an aluminum frame and an Infinity-O display, protected by Corning Gorilla Victus Plus on both the front and back.</p><p>The display is expected to be 6.7 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate and Full HD+ resolution. It could also reach a peak brightness of 1900 nits, with bezels as thin as 1.99mm.</p><p>The rear cameras might include a 50MP primary wide-angle shooter, a 12MP ultra wide-angle lens, and an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. On the front, there’s expected to be a 10MP sensor for selfies.</p><p>The battery capacity isn’t confirmed yet (though it’s rumored to be 4565mAh), but it’s expected to deliver 78 hours of listening time and up to 29 hours of video playback. Like the flagship Galaxy S24 series, the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, the Fan Edition will also feature Samsung&apos;s proprietary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p>
<p>The report also mentions that the Galaxy S24 FE will likely run on an Exynos 2400e processor, shipping with One UI 6.1.1, and featuring the Portrait Studio. In the U.S., its predecessor came with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, while other markets received the Exynos version. It seems likely that Samsung will follow a similar strategy this year.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-supplier-launch-reported">launch is expected</a> to be sometime around October, and the device will presumably compete with the higher <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range segment</a>, including models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. As for pricing, we expect it to be similar to the Galaxy S23 FE, which started at $599.</p>

The full-size controller just feels better to hold and use, and the hall effect thumbsticks and triggers are better than what&apos;s on console-grade controllers.</p><p>With the G8 Plus, GameSir is reusing the same design, but eschewing USB-C connectivity in favor of Bluetooth. In doing so, it is making the G8 Plus compatible with a significantly wider range of devices, including Android phones and tablets, iPhones, iPads, the Nintendo Switch, Windows, and just about anything that takes a Bluetooth controller.</p><p>That means you get the same great features as the G8 Galileo, but with the added convenience of Bluetooth. In short, if you&apos;re in need of a new mobile gaming controller, there really isn&apos;t anything better right now.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-pricing-and-availability"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<p>GameSir unveiled the G8 Plus mobile gaming controller on July 29, and it is now on sale globally. The G8 Plus is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">available for just $79 on Amazon</a>, and that&apos;s a bargain considering what you actually get. The regular G8 with USB-C connectivity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG">also costs the same</a>, and I&apos;d argue that the Bluetooth model is much more versatile.</p><p>You can also pick up the controller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/g8plus-bluetooth-mobile-controller">from the brand&apos;s own website</a>. Just like the standard edition, there isn&apos;t a carrying case bundled with the package — that&apos;s an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Controller-Bag/dp/B0CR15KD1W">additional $15</a> if you&apos;re buying the controller on Amazon.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-what-i-like"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HH3iJgika9kQfp2jYyuK7h" name="gamesir-g8-plus-2.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus next to the standard G8 Galileo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HH3iJgika9kQfp2jYyuK7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>GameSir nailed the design of the G8 Galileo, and it isn&apos;t changing anything with the G8 Plus. The controller has a full-size design, and there&apos;s a textured finish at the back that makes it easy to hold and use. The size is easily one of the best things about the G8 Plus; having full-size triggers, action buttons, and thumbsticks is just much more convenient, and the contoured design is comfortable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5F4ccgBitEpL5Yt7BTdZXi" name="gamesir-g8-plus-10.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus controller with Vivo X100 Ultra slotted in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5F4ccgBitEpL5Yt7BTdZXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another plus point is the customizability; the faceplates detach easily, and you can switch out the thumbsticks — two additional sizes are bundled in the package — and even the configuration of the X, Y, A, and B action buttons, ideal if you&apos;re pairing it with the Switch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rXtSLuLfyxe9HepV4HtnLi" name="gamesir-g8-plus-9.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus controller with Vivo X100 Ultra slotted in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rXtSLuLfyxe9HepV4HtnLi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The action buttons and D-Pad have good tactility, but it&apos;s the triggers and thumbsticks that differentiate the G8 Plus. GameSir uses hall effect magnetic sensors, and that means you&apos;ll never see any stick drift; while I&apos;ve only had the G8 Plus for a month, I used the G8 Galileo for the better part of a year now, and even after hundreds of hours of use, it has the same great feedback as day one.</p><p>The triggers have a great range of motion and excellent feedback, and the fact that you can change the size of the thumbsticks is an added bonus. There are two paddles at the back, and setting these up with in-game actions is relatively easy.</p>

<p>Coming in at 314g, the G8 Plus is 60g heavier than the G8 Galileo. The added weight is due to the 1000mAh internal battery, and thankfully, the heft is balanced on both sides (there&apos;s a 500mAh battery underneath each section). The added weight is noticeable, but it doesn&apos;t cause any fatigue even after extended gaming sessions.</p><p>While the G8 is available in a grey color scheme, the G8 Plus switches to a darker grey that looks a little better. You still get the same rubber bridge that ensures the controller doesn&apos;t damage your phone, and the left side has good enough extension that you can slot in tablets without a lot of hassle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dbAKUeZNXmEx9Rkj6cedji" name="gamesir-g8-plus-11.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus controller with Vivo X100 Ultra slotted in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbAKUeZNXmEx9Rkj6cedji.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cases aren&apos;t an issue either, and I was able to use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> with rather bulky cases attached. There&apos;s enough clearance available, and the phone is held snugly between the two halves. The matte texture of the G8 Plus doesn&apos;t attract smudges, and overall, there isn&apos;t anything to fault on the design side of things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ei7wnKBktmFvB7vdZnptHh" name="gamesir-g8-plus-3.jpg" alt="Back of the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ei7wnKBktmFvB7vdZnptHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting started with the G8 Plus is about as straightforward as it gets; pairing over Bluetooth is seamless, and it maintained a rock-solid connection. The GameSir logo has an LED ring that changes color based on what device is connected to it; Android is yellow, iOS is blue, Switch is red, and so on. You can change modes by selecting the record button and one of the action buttons, and you can easily switch between devices.</p>

<p>In terms of day-to-day performance, there isn&apos;t a mobile gaming controller that is as good as the G8 Plus. The triggers and buttons have fantastic feedback, and I know I&apos;ve said this a few times by now, but the fact that you get full-size buttons makes all the difference. I used mobile controllers that are aimed at portability, and they&apos;re not as much fun to use — particularly during marathon gaming sessions. That isn&apos;t a problem with the G8 Plus.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-what-i-don-t-like"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZiDwadYyzkhLpJ7A9UgC6j" name="gamesir-g8-plus-13.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus doesn't fit phones with big cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiDwadYyzkhLpJ7A9UgC6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the G8 Plus retains the same design as the G8 Galileo, it shares the same drawbacks. If you have a phone with a large camera island, you can&apos;t slot it into the controller. I had issues with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>. The only phones that didn&apos;t have clearance issues were the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Pixel 8 Pro, so I ended up using the G8 Plus with these devices most of the time.</p>
<p>However, there is a workaround; as there&apos;s no need to connect over USB-C, I was able to slot in the X100 Ultra in a way that the camera island sits flush with the rubber back of the controller (instead of slotting into the extended section), and while it isn&apos;t as secure a fit, it is usable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pXCoEQBj4D5QafPh9QLmEj" name="gamesir-g8-plus-14.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus with USB-C connector highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pXCoEQBj4D5QafPh9QLmEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because the G8 Plus connects over Bluetooth, it misses out on two extras that I used extensively on the G8 Galileo: 3.5mm jack and passthrough charging. There is a USB-C port on the side of the controller, but that&apos;s to charge its internal battery.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-the-competition"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DezWRoKYyzmuM2x4JWdA9H" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-2.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo with Pixel 8 Pro docked and playing a game" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DezWRoKYyzmuM2x4JWdA9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no shortage of mobile controllers, and the Backbone One continues to lead the pack. That said, if you want a controller with full-size buttons, I&apos;d recommend the G8 Galileo; it eschews Bluetooth in favor of USB-C, but you get passthrough charging and the convenience of a 3.5mm jack. At $79, it costs the same as the G8 Plus.</p><p>Scuf&apos;s Nomad is a good choice if you want a smaller controller that has high-quality triggers and buttons. It isn&apos;t as comfortable to hold and use as the G8 Plus, but it&apos;s easier to carry on the road, and it has Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-plus-should-you-buy-it"><span>GameSir G8 Plus: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a mobile controller with Bluetooth</li><li>You need full-size triggers and buttons</li><li>You want excellent battery life</li><li>You need hall effect thumbsticks</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have a phone with sizeable cameras</li><li>You need a controller with a 3.5mm jack and passthrough charging</li></ul>
<p>GameSir didn&apos;t make any design modifications to the G8 Plus, and that&apos;s a good thing. The G8 Galileo is arguably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">best Android game controller</a> around, and a big part of its allure is the size; the ability to use full-size triggers, thumbsticks, action buttons, and D-Pad on a mobile gaming controller is wonderful, and it is the main reason why I like the G8 so much.</p><p>The G8 Plus follows in the same vein, and Bluetooth integration makes it easier to use. There&apos;s absolutely no lag or delay when using the controller, and the triggers are among the best you&apos;ll find in this segment. It is heavier than the standard G8, but the added heft isn&apos;t too noticeable, and battery life has been terrific.</p><p>To sum up, there isn&apos;t much to fault with the G8 Plus, and if you need a mobile gaming controller that connects over Bluetooth, it&apos;s my go-to recommendation.</p>

<p>Smart rings have the potential to beat smartwatches when it comes to step-counting accuracy. We tested the most popular smart rings today, and three of them outperformed our favorite smartwatches for exact step counts. Unfortunately, smart rings have a problem with <em>phantom</em> steps that must be fixed before we can fully recommend them.</p><p>Smart rings aren&apos;t built for fitness tracking the way smartwatches are. They can&apos;t sample your heart rate as often because of smaller battery capacity, they become less accurate when your fingers swell from faster blood flow, and you have no screen to check your progress. In particular, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> has underwhelmed us with its paltry fitness features.</p><p>So, imagine my surprise when I asked our reviewer to do a Galaxy Ring step test, and it measured only 11 extra steps after taking 5,000 steps—significantly better than his Pixel Watch 2 (192 extra). I&apos;ve done several smartwatch step tests in the last year, and only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> have come close to that accuracy level.</p><p>When comparing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-key-differences">smart rings vs. smartwatches</a>, we generally trust the former for sleep tracking and health data and the latter for workouts. But getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">10,000 steps a day</a> is more of a mainstream health issue than a true "workout," and it&apos;d be great if smart rings excelled at this casual metric.</p><p>Since I only own one smart ring, I enlisted our phones editor, Nick Sutrich, and our managing editor, Derrek Lee, to perform step tests to see whether smart rings can beat smartwatches for step counting across brands. Here&apos;s how each device did:</p>

<p>I never thought of smart rings as particularly reliable for step counting because my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> undercounts them. Things balance out because it&apos;ll count false steps while I&apos;m at home, but I found most smartwatches to be better, and I&apos;ve seen plenty of complaints on the r/Ultrahuman subreddit that back me up.</p><p>Competing smart ring brands have their step-count algorithms a bit more fine-tuned! The Samsung Galaxy Ring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, and Amazfit Helio Ring all came within 12 steps of the actual walking total. The RingConn Smart Ring Gen 2 was ridiculously off after Lee&apos;s first test but did more respectably in its second test, better than some popular smartwatches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-step-test-with-Fitbit-Charge-6-and-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer held in hand with the number 5,000, a Garmin Forerunner 165 (5,062 steps), and a Fitbit Charge 6 (4,812 steps)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">One of my previous smartwatch step count tests </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For comparison, most smartwatches tend to fall into the good-but-not-great range. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">cheap fitness watch accuracy test</a> this March, the Forerunner 165 (+11 steps after 5,000) did excellently, while the Coros Pace 3 (+84) and Fitbit Charge 6 (-199) weren&apos;t quite as reliable. </p><p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">first step-counting test</a> last year, Amazfit (+46), Apple (-60), and Samsung (+74) fell into that same adequate range, with my Fitbit (-286) pretty horrendous and Garmin (+14) winning.</p><p>That&apos;s why my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> surprised me by doing so well in this walking test, matching my Garmin Forerunner 965. No non-Garmin smartwatch has fallen within a ±30-step range across a half-dozen step tests, until now. Maybe some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> devs have started to fine-tune their step algorithms, too! </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6ZbxiTFz2AU8sEwWMHvK8k" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-03.jpg" alt="Holding the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ZbxiTFz2AU8sEwWMHvK8k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But returning to the main point, I&apos;m impressed with how well smart rings do for step counting in normal walking conditions. A few standout watches aside, <em>most</em> of them miscount by at least 100 steps after a couple of miles.</p><p>It&apos;s much harder to track steps while running—try keeping count when you&apos;re stepping twice as fast and out of breath—but Sutrich said his Galaxy Ring step count seemed much more realistic than his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> count after a 5K spartan race (even though the PW2 was <em>much</em> better at heart rate).</p><p>So, what&apos;s the "major flaw" I hinted at in the headline? Simple: smart rings across brands will track hundreds or <em>thousands</em> of steps when you&apos;re at home or in the office. </p><p>Typing an email? Take some steps. Gesticulating excitedly during a conversation? Have some more steps! Cooking dinner? Your smartwatch will add maybe 50 steps as you move around the kitchen; your smart ring could add 2–10X that. You get some extra steps, and you get some extra steps, and <em>you</em> get some extra steps!</p><p>Sutrich&apos;s Galaxy Ring did near-perfectly while walking, but he&apos;d managed to hit 3,675 steps <em>before</em> the test, and he confirmed he hadn&apos;t done anything active that day. That&apos;s the equivalent of nearly two miles of walking around the house and yard, and it&apos;s unlikely he was anywhere close to that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9szTm994H89RsmcghQJdo" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-vs-Oura-Ring-Gen-3-2.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring and Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9szTm994H89RsmcghQJdo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A couple of Android Central team members own Oura Rings, and they were the first to warn me about the false-step issue, adding thousands of phantom steps daily while they&apos;re at home working on articles or playing with pets.</p><p>Smartwatches don&apos;t have this issue to the same extent. Some brands have the occasional false step or fulfill <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">stand alerts</a> when they shouldn&apos;t, but you won&apos;t see thousands of steps unless you&apos;re truly walking or working out.</p><p>If smart ring makers can tweak their accelerometer data to detect the difference between incidental movement and true steps, then that&apos;ll be the final step (pun intended) in making rings more useful for casual fitness tracking. That&apos;s a big if: Oura&apos;s had years to improve in this area. </p><p>But the fact that multiple smart ring brands have already cracked the step-tracking code in normal conditions, beating out decade-old smartwatch brands, gives me hope that they&apos;ll improve at seeing through non-step movement in the near future.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Orico is best known for its HDD and SSD enclosures, and the Chinese manufacturer has been at it for over 15 years. The brand has recently ventured into Thunderbolt 4 docking stations, storage servers, and SSDs, and I&apos;m kickstarting coverage with the Mecha O20, a rugged external SSD that&apos;s aiming to go up against the likes of the Crucial X10 Pro and Samsung T9.</p><p>The Mecha O20 is available in 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB storage variants, and the 2TB model I&apos;m using is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Portable-External-Resistance-Professionals/dp/B0CQLDRCQX">available for $167 on Amazon</a>, an enticing 30% discount on its $239 retail price. The discount makes it a much better value than its rivals, and having used the Mecha O20 for the better part of a month, I can confidently say that it holds up against the best that this segment has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VpgzQuS3LuNjxRG9SBHByB" name="orico-mecha-o20-3.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD in-hand view showing size" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VpgzQuS3LuNjxRG9SBHByB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is a key talking point of the Mecha O20, so let&apos;s start there. While most external SSDs have an enclosure that&apos;s weather-resistant and tumble-proof, Orico is taking things to a whole new level. The chassis of the Mecha O20 is made out of an aluminum alloy, and it is durable in its own right. But what&apos;s interesting is that Orico added silicon casing to the chassis, and that allows it to withstand the elements much better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GdmRLi5ehEsNfynMwCDBNC" name="orico-mecha-o20-5.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD USB-C covered" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdmRLi5ehEsNfynMwCDBNC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part is that the USB-C port is also covered by a silicone plug, and you&apos;ll need to lift the flap to get to the connector. The only issue with this is that because the port is recessed, you can&apos;t use all USB-C cables; the usual Acefast cables I use have a larger USB connector, and they were too big; this is the same problem as having a bulky phone case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4xDtUyzBhW5jd4WiuDrmB" name="orico-mecha-o20-2.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD with USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4xDtUyzBhW5jd4WiuDrmB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, Orico includes a 20Gbps cable with the package, and it has a 2-in-1 connector that doubles as USB-A or USB-C based on target device. I plugged the SSD into several Android phones, Windows machine, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, and it worked straight out the bat — no need to configure anything. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ByNf5YKXwGGqviBtWqvxAC" name="orico-mecha-o20-4.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD next to other external SSDs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ByNf5YKXwGGqviBtWqvxAC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis and added silicone casing makes the Mecha O20 bulkier than most external SSDs, but it isn&apos;t so big that it affects portability — you can still carry it around in a bag with ease. At 189g, it isn&apos;t heavy either, and the grey color scheme is understated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oXxvVKCHtdVdDv7kzdz6iC" name="orico-mecha-o20-7.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD side view showing silicone casing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXxvVKCHtdVdDv7kzdz6iC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a hanging loop to one side, and if you&apos;re so inclined, you can attach the SSD to the outside of your bag — it is resistant to rain, tumbles, and dirt. The SSD comes with an IP54 rating, so while it isn&apos;t advisable to dunk it in water, it holds up incredibly well in any other scenario.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MwGZ5cEh3z3Bwy8kNWTy5D" name="orico-mecha-o20-9.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD next to Vivo X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MwGZ5cEh3z3Bwy8kNWTy5D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Mecha O20 uses a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, and that means you get a 20Gbps bandwidth, with reads going up to 2,000MB/s. There aren&apos;t many devices that use the Gen 2x2 interface, and in that scenario, it switches to the 10Gbps USB standard. In my usage, I saw reads going up to 1,829MB/s and writes of 1,634MB/s, and that&apos;s among the highest of any external SSD I tested.</p>
<p>Random read/writes hovered at the 200MB/s figure, and again, that&apos;s a great showing by the SSD. I didn&apos;t see any issues transferring thousands of photos and videos from the Vivo X100 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro, and the moving hundreds of gigabytes of data from Windows. In this regard, it has proven to be just as reliable as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-drive-your-chromebox">best external SSDs</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4qd4VptqPxBS5957Nmo5ZC" name="orico-mecha-o20-6.jpg" alt="Orico Mecha O20 2TB SSD in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qd4VptqPxBS5957Nmo5ZC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a result, I have no qualms recommending the Mecha O20. I have a dozen external SSDs, and the Mecha O20 easily has the most rugged design. Thanks to the Gen 2x2 interface, it is among the fastest SSDs around as well, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in daily use. If you&apos;re in need of an external SSD and want something that doesn&apos;t cost as much as Samsung, the Mecha O20 is the one to get.</p>

In a lot of ways, it&apos;s another average mid-range phone but there are some great standout features. I was excited to see them all, but what <em>really</em> caught my eye is what HMD calls "HMD Gen 2 repairability."</p><p>This weekly column is where my bosses kind of let me be me, and you usually won&apos;t see me talk about a phone or give my own type of review here. This week is going to be different because this phone is worth talking about.</p>

<p>The Skyline seems like an average budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">Android phone under $400</a> with some standout features in the camera department. It is, and that&apos;s what a lot of people will think about it.</p><p>It does have one other feature that you won&apos;t find in any other phones: "HMD Gen 2 repairability." I&apos;ll talk a bit more about what that means later down the page, but I&apos;ll give you a teaser: I love it. It&apos;s a standout feature that belongs on every phone we buy, regardless of price.</p>
<h2 id="design-and-specs-2">Design and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gi2Fk6VXsqzEAL7T3FY5pY" name="HMD-Skyline-2.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gi2Fk6VXsqzEAL7T3FY5pY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you pick up the Skyline, you will think about the Nokia smartphones of the past. It&apos;s a cross between the old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9">Nokia N9</a> and Lumia phones that ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com">Windows Phone</a>, built with a solid metal body and a plastic back. Yes, plastic — Nokia-style "good" plastic. There&apos;s nothing to complain about unless you don&apos;t dig the sharp corners of the metal frame.</p><p>The fit and finish on my unit are awesome, and I&apos;m serious when I say it reminds me of the N9 (a phone I loved) when I&apos;m holding it. Other people say it reminds them of a premium Lumia model, and I can see it. What I&apos;m saying here is that this phone gives a feeling of quality.</p>
<p>A few things stand out, namely the side-mounted fingerprint/power button and a standalone custom button that can be programmed to open your favorite apps or perform phone functions.</p><p>The side-mounted fingerprint sensor is one of those things you will either love or hate. It&apos;s fast; pressing it reads your fingerprint and unlocks the phone in one motion. Of course, it acts as a security feature in apps that can use a fingerprint sensor. I love this design and prefer it over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/business-front-why-i-never-want-rear-fingerprint-sensor-ever-again">in-screen systems</a> because it&apos;s faster and more accurate, and the power button is how I turn my phone screen on. If you are someone who taps the screen and then uses the sensor, you might not care for it.</p>

<p>So, the Skyline is not one of those powerhouse phones that people love to talk about. Its specs are powerful enough to serve the intended purpose, but it won&apos;t match <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the latest superphone</a> with the latest chip when it comes to raw power.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not going to work well. I&apos;ve found no problems with the phone slowing down during the time I&apos;ve been using it, including playing games, surfing the web, and watching videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.98%;"><img id="iRniscpcSBSHWVRdY7e5S5" name="Skyline-software.png" alt="HMD Skyline software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRniscpcSBSHWVRdY7e5S5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2397" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display is good; the colors look fine, the viewing angle is good, and it has a great way of handling screen refresh. There are four modes: Standard (60Hz only), 120Hz, 144Hz, and Auto. 120 and 144Hz lock your refresh rates to those numbers, and Auto will scale between 60 and 120Hz depending on whether you&apos;re acting with the screen (it ramps up) or playing a full-screen video. If you want to use power and have a 144Hz refresh display, you certainly can, but I found the auto setting to work well.</p><p>The screen isn&apos;t exceptionally bright, and that becomes apparent outside in the sun. It&apos;s bright enough, but just barely.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n3CVznVANEF2nV3JT7FPC9" name="HMD-Skyline-Qi2-1.jpg" alt="Qi2 charger coil" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3CVznVANEF2nV3JT7FPC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I purposely didn&apos;t gauge battery life, and I can&apos;t judge network performance because this is not a phone built for North America (at least, not the model I have). Battery life in a phone is very dependent on your network signal strength, so there is no way for me to accurately judge how well the Skyline does. On Airplane mode with Wi-Fi enabled, it lasts about 10.5 hours of non-stop streaming video before it complains that the battery is low.</p><p>The charging speed is average, but I saw no issues. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins" target="_blank">Qi2 wireless charging</a> also works with a standard Qi charger once you align the coils, but it will not charge at the Qi2 15W rated speed when used this way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2150px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.12%;"><img id="stwaAdST4Ez3qRKxogGSXA" name="Skyline-camera-features.png" alt="HMD Skyline camera features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/stwaAdST4Ez3qRKxogGSXA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2150" height="2389" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera system takes fine photos, but nothing wowed me. The highlights are the 50MP lens with optical zoom, a front-facing camera with true auto-focus, and HMD&apos;s software additions that use AI to deliver good night photos or gesture controls for the selfie camera.</p><p>I found the optical zoom also delivers decent macro shots if you provide plenty of light, with the camera AI turning out close-up photos better than I expected.</p><p>You will take great photos with the Skyline. You&apos;ll also take mediocre photos. The same can be said for most phones.</p>

<p>If you read all this and think the Skyline is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">solid "budget" phone</a> (it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/hmd-skyline?sku=HQ50200045X70">starts at just $499</a> for the 8GB/128GB model), you are absolutely right. A lot of people are looking for a phone like the Skyline, and its excellent design pushes it to the top of the budget phone heap if it is available where you live. You should take a close look at it. But it has one more trick up its sleeve, and that&apos;s <strong>real</strong> user serviceability.</p>
<h2 id="user-serviceability-is-a-cinch-2">User-serviceability is a cinch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD" name="HMD-Skyline-3.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is what makes the Skyline great to me. In fact, it makes me question why other phones that sell for hundreds more don&apos;t offer something similar. I&apos;m <strong>not</strong> saying the Skyline is great when it comes to sustainability because you&apos;ll only see two years of software updates, and that&apos;s a shame, especially because you&apos;ll easily be able to keep this phone going longer than two years.</p><p>The Skyline doesn&apos;t have a battery you can swap out when it gets low and I think those days are gone. It does have the next best thing — a battery that&apos;s simple to replace once it reaches the end of its useful life while still keeping the phone water resistant. </p>
<p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone 5</a> are simple to repair if you know what you&apos;re doing and can offer great multi-year software support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">I love them</a>. But the Skyline is the phone <strong>you</strong> can repair at home on your kitchen table.</p><p>With a T3 Torx screwdriver and a few guitar picks you can open the phone up to replace the battery, the charging board, the display, and the speaker using parts you will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/HMD_Skyline">find at iFixIt</a>. You won&apos;t need heat guns and special tools to crack things open and once inside things are laid out to make replacements easy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VvyPTykDqE9reWkY2MBvZ" name="HMD-Skyline-6.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VvyPTykDqE9reWkY2MBvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A small cam is in the bottom corner of the phone, and turning it lifts the corner of the phone&apos;s rear cover. Once you&apos;ve done that, use something like a guitar pick or a plastic spudger to go around the back cover and release the clips that hold it on.</p><p>From there, it&apos;s easy to unplug cables, replace a battery or charging board, or get to other screws that hold the display to the main board. This sounds harder than it is, and anyone with steady hands who can follow a simple guide can do all of this themselves. If you&apos;re not the type who wants to do this, easy repairability also means it should cost a lot less to have a shop fix your phone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Once the HMD Skyline is opened up, fiddling around and replacing parts is incredibly easy, and that's very important on a phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I can&apos;t stress how important this is enough. All of us have had a phone that seems to not hold a charge very long or one where we&apos;ve broken the screen. At that point, you usually don&apos;t even think about fixing it yourself because the phone wasn&apos;t designed to be easy to fix. The Skyline was designed that way, and it is still rated IP54 water resistant. You can&apos;t take underwater photos with your Skyline, but it can survive a spilled drink (or maybe even an accidental dunk, but don&apos;t count on it).  </p><p>And it still has a back that comes off so you can get to the parts without being an electronics tech with a box full of specialty tools. More importantly, everything goes back together just as easily.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-to-recommend-this-but-2">I want to recommend this, but...</h2>
<p>Since this is my version of a review, I&apos;m going to tell it to you straight. You should buy this phone if:</p>
<ul><li>You want a cheap phone with a good camera.</li><li>You're OK with two years of software support.</li><li>You want a phone you can fix yourself if you break the screen or need a new battery.</li></ul>
<p>You shouldn&apos;t buy this phone if:</p>
<ul><li>You need a support window longer than two years.</li><li>You want a phone with the best specs.</li><li>You spend all day outside in the brightest sun.</li></ul>
<p>I take issue with HMD&apos;s support schedule, especially for a phone where I can change the battery every few years. I also know a lot of people won&apos;t care and buy a new phone every couple of years anyway. There has been talk about HMD offering support for bootloader unlocking, and that would be enough to put me squarely in the "would buy" camp. Until then, <em>I</em> would pass, even though I think the repairability of this phone makes it special.</p><p>Regardless, if you&apos;re in North America, don&apos;t buy the Skyline unless HMD releases a localized version. HMD is not selling this phone here because it hasn&apos;t been designed yet to work here. Hopefully, the reports of HMD releasing the Skyline for the U.S. and Canada in the future will come to fruition, and then you can make that decision for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>On Monday (Aug. 5), a judge ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly with Search, years after the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit alleging that Google was using unfair practices to maintain its position in the market.</p><p>These practices include paying companies like Apple to set Google as the default search engine on its devices and making it hard for competitors, such as Bing, to reach consumers.</p><p>"For years, Google has secured default placements through distribution contracts," Judge Mehta states in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25032745-045110819896" target="_blank">289-page ruling</a> obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>"In exchange for revenue share, Google not only received placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any other general search engine on the device. Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google."</p><p>Google responded by saying that the ruling notes that its search engine is the best but "concludes that we shouldn&apos;t be allowed to make it easily available." The company plans to appeal but is preparing for another trial in September over its advertising technology.</p>

It features a new design with an ethernet port and is powered by a "newer" chipset that should boost performance. There is also 32GB of storage, which is 4x as much as Google&apos;s previous devices.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer has a new remote with a customizable magic button and a new Find My Remote function. It also acts as a smart home hub, with access to controls straight from the TV and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> support, and the device doubles as a Thread border router. Lastly, the Google TV Streamer features AI recommendations powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p>

Users will be able to see the price of content directly within the marketplace, and this will make it easier for developers to make money off of their creations.</p><p>The plus side is that paid apps and watch faces appear to be much more premium than non-paid ones.

A Meta spokesperson told Android Central that the cuts weren&apos;t being made to "save money," per se. Rather, these cuts are being made to ensure that Reality Labs stays within the new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a "better long-term impact" in VR development.</p><p>The closure follows reports that Meta is cutting Reality Labs&apos; budget by 20% as the division <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q2-2024-earnings">continues to lose billions</a> every quarter despite impressive Quest sales. However, Meta assures that it&apos;s still committed to VR development, although it&apos;s unclear if the company plans to port the studio&apos;s Lone Echo games to the Quest.</p><p>Ready at Dawn Studios employees will receive the same severance that previous Meta layoffs offered.</p>

Adding a state ID appears to be fairly simple; users would only need to set it up through the Wallet app, not with the CA DMV Wallet app. Even so, users will be encouraged to carry their physical IDs, as the digital ones may not be accepted everywhere, including at certain airports.</p><p>For now, it&apos;s unclear when this will roll out, but it&apos;s a positive sign as Google looks to eventually make the Wallet app the only thing you need when you leave the house.</p>

<ul><li>New information reveals what to expect from the Pixel 9 handsets.</li><li>The company will likely offer a Google One AI Premium plan for Pixel 9 owners who purchase the device before October 31, 2025.</li><li>The offers also include six months of Fitbit Premium subscription and three months of YouTube Premium.</li></ul>
<p>Google is gearing up to launch the Pixel 9 series next week on August 13. Thanks to countless leaks, we have seen a lot of what&apos;s coming.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-bonuses-freebies">Android Headlines</a>, some leaked material hints that Pixel 9 Pro Fold buyers will get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a> for free with every purchase of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. Besides, they would also get six months of Fitbit Premium subscription in addition to three months of YouTube Premium subscription.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.39%;"><img id="nc8Cxg6uTg7r25mSeecz2c" name="Google-Pixel-9-pro-promo-leak.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Promo leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nc8Cxg6uTg7r25mSeecz2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1064" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that these freebies are not just for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> but also for the other products in the line-up, like the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the newbie Pixel 9 Pro XL. Yes, provided that they purchase any of these products before October 31, 2025, which is probably up until the next Pixel series launch next year. This means that any users purchasing any Pixel 9 product over the course of the next year can take advantage of these freebies.</p><p>Another leak from last week revealed the pricing and specs of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series and shared the launch offers. The details shared then were more or less the same, per the publication. Since the emphasis is naturally on AI, the Google One AI Premium plan is a good choice that the company wants to offer to Pixel 9 series buyers.</p>
<p>They not only get access to Gemini&apos;s Advanced feature but also benefit from 2TB of Google One storage. The bundled offer is usually charged $19.99 per month if bought separately. Google also offered many freebies with a purchase of the Pixel 8 last year but this Gemini Advanced offer would be something new.</p><p>The company offered a six-month trial of the Google One Premium 2TB plan for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and Pixel 8 Pro buyers, and the offer persists until December 31, 2024. Similarly, the more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> offers a three-month trial of the Google One Premium 100 GB plan, which ends next year on December 31, 2025.</p><p>These offers truly sound interesting for potential buyers of the Pixel 9 series after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">launch event</a>. It will be encouraging to see what else Google has in its store next week.</p>

<ul><li>A photo of Huawei's former CEO, Richard Yu, has started circulating social media because it seems he's holding a tri-folding phone.</li><li>A Weibo tipster stated the device is similar to a prototype they've seen with a 10-inch inner display alongside speculation that it could launch before Q4 2024.</li><li>An early report claimed that Huawei started "mass-producing" a tri-fold phone in February and that it would feature a display similar to the running theory.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The foldable world could be in for a shake-up as a photo suggests Huawei&apos;s tri-fold device is very real.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/09/huaweis-tri-foldable-phone-spotted-in-real-launching-soon/">Gizmochina</a>, a photo of Huawei&apos;s former CEO Richard Yu preparing for a flight shows him supposedly holding a tri-fold phone. Enhancing the image offers a vague look at where the device might bend (or fold) to open/close. Additionally, it looks like the far left of the device is slightly bent, potentially indicating the first hinge&apos;s placement.</p><p>Chiming in is Chinese Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/Orr2aF2z9?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), who claims that the device in question is the real deal. They claim the photographed device is similar to a previously witnessed prototype with a double hinge design. More importantly, the device is rumored to feature a 10-inch inner display when open.</p><p>A punch-hole selfie camera is speculated for the "far left" of the internal display. A specification rumor states the tri-fold phone will contain HiSilicon&apos;s Kirin 9 series SoC. Additionally, DCS suggests this tri-fold device will debut "earlier than the Huawei Mate 70."</p><p>The publication states that the Mate 70 isn&apos;t expected to hit the shelves until Q4 2024, which <em>could </em>mean we&apos;re closer to the world&apos;s first tri-folding device than we realize. Take this with a grain of salt, but speculation states we could see anywhere from now until September.</p>

<p>Huawei&apos;s tri-folding phone is expected to debut with a "premium" price tag. Users on Weibo have also started wondering if the company will include a stylus due to its size.</p><p>The idea of a "tri-fold" phone piqued consumer interest reports claimed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-huawei-new-foldable-phone-push">Huawei started developing such a device</a> earlier this year. That post stated the Chinese company started "mass-producing" a device that would fold twice to form a "Z" shape. Similarly, early rumors claimed the device would offer a 10-inch internal display, which continues to be the running theory.</p><p>Unfortunately, the device never arrived during the first half of the year as the report claimed. So, we&apos;ll have to see if this next rumored timeframe pans out.</p><p>The other side of that report dealt with Samsung who were supposedly putting the "rollable" phone idea back on the table. The Korean OEM did show off a prototype of a rolling phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">during CES 2024</a>, so maybe that theory holds water.</p>

<p>I&apos;m no engineer, so I don&apos;t know if it would actually be feasible, but I would love to see a Pixel Watch with the ability to navigate the menus by swiping your finger around the outer casing.</p><p>This is basically the premise of navigating menus or adjusting the temperature on the thermostat. After spending a few minutes playing around with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">4th Gen Nest Thermostat</a>, this kind of interaction makes much more sense than smudging up the screen. I can&apos;t help but wonder why Google hasn&apos;t done this with the Watch, especially when it&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s a bit of "one hand washes the other" going on internally. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I&apos;d love it if we saw some type of physical rotating bezel akin to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, but that&apos;s unlikely. I can&apos;t imagine Google making a watch large or bulky enough for something like that to even be implemented.</p><p>Speaking of Samsung, it has used a touch-sensitive bezel in different Galaxy Watch models over the years. We&apos;ve also seen physical rotating bezels on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review">Galaxy Watch 3 Classic</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Watch 4 Classic</a>, and Watch 6 Classic. Rather disappointingly, Samsung opted against bringing it back with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. </p>

<p>Admittedly, I&apos;ve found that the touch bezel solution is <em>very</em> hit or miss, seemingly only working when it wants to. But since there isn&apos;t a digital crown on any Galaxy Watch besides the Ultra, the only other way to interact with your watch is to swipe up, down, and around on the screen. </p><p>It&apos;s really not <em>that</em> big of a deal unless you&apos;re someone like me who has sausage links for fingers. My fat fingers get in the way of being able to see everything, and it&apos;s frankly just a frustrating experience, especially when dealing with such small crowns like the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>Perhaps that&apos;s the reason why we have yet to see anything like what the Nest Thermostat offers being integrated into Google&apos;s wearable. Samsung and Google have supposedly been working closely together on the platform ever since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-wear-os-google-smartwatch">partnership</a> was announced alongside Wear OS 3. Because of that, I can only assume that Google has some kind of idea about the benefits and pain points of the touch bezel.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not expecting anything drastically different from the Pixel Watch 3 series. Hell, I&apos;m just happy that all signs point to Google releasing a larger version, almost as excited as I am about a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel Fold</a> (odd name notwithstanding). </p><p>I also don&apos;t want to go so far as to presume that this is something that Google has in the cards for a future Pixel Watch model. Who&apos;s to say that the company "gives up the hardware goose" after this year and just lets Samsung become the only real choice if you want an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>? It&apos;s not outside the realm of possibility, especially if Google ends up needing to find more projects to send to the graveyard.</p>

<p>No matter what, seeing the similarities between the 4th Gen Nest Thermostat and Pixel Watch has me a little excited. Instead of "the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing," it <em>feels</em> like there&apos;s some cross-pollination happening. If you need any additional evidence of this, just check out the design of the different screens on the Thermostat. You can&apos;t tell me that they don&apos;t look like Pixel Watch faces. </p><p>Hopefully, this will become a trend with Google devices, as long as it makes sense and is not done just for the sake of it. </p>
