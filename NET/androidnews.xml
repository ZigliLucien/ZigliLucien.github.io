                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Marketing for the new OnePlus Watch 2R styles it as a sporty, long-lasting Wear OS watch for "inspiring an active lifestyle," with a lighter design for "those who value all-day fitness" tracking. I love watches that cater directly to me, but my colleagues who tested the OnePlus Watch 2 bashed its health data as its Achilles&apos; heel. So I decided to test the Watch 2R accuracy for myself.</p><p>With the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, our reviewer Harish complained that it "just isn&apos;t reliable at daily step counts or activity tracking," that it misjudged burned calories after workouts, and that its stress data was artificially elevated. </p><p>Meanwhile, my colleague Nick did a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch-2-one-week-challenge">one-week OnePlus Watch 2 test</a> and had similar complaints about underestimated steps and significantly lower HR numbers during anaerobic workouts. Both Nick and Harish suspected that the watch used its low-power RTOS coprocessor to handle health and fitness sampling and that it wasn&apos;t fast or consistent enough to get proper readings.</p><p>This made me leery about testing the OnePlus Watch 2R, a fitness watch that theoretically couldn&apos;t handle fitness all that well. So, just like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a> last week, I strapped on two smartwatches to see how the Watch 2R could match up against my Garmin Forerunner 965 for heart rate and dual-band GPS accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="my-oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-test-2">My OnePlus Watch 2R fitness test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9jBLuUaCjpPSwj6RNaqJSS" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-versus-Garmin-heart-rate.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2R (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jBLuUaCjpPSwj6RNaqJSS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus&apos; OHealth companion app doesn&apos;t let you export TCX/GPX files like Samsung Health, and I had some issues getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> to send my data properly, so I couldn&apos;t do my usual HR or GPS charts for a direct comparison; I&apos;ll use tables as an alternative for now.</p>

<p>For my first jog, the OnePlus Watch 2R stayed mostly on track with the Garmin Forerunner 965. I spot-checked heart rates at ten different timestamps, and the 2R matched the 965 four times and was 1bpm short six times, which dovetails with the 1bpm-lower average.</p><p>GPS accuracy mostly remained on point. It&apos;s difficult to say if OnePlus&apos; dual-band accuracy is more or less reliable than Garmin&apos;s since both maps had me straying off the sidewalk at odd moments, but I appreciated that both fell into the same general ballpark for a run with some signal-blocking foliage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-running-form-stats.jpeg" alt="Running form data on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for running dynamics, the OnePlus Watch 2R synced pretty well for stride length and average vertical ratio, but measured my vertical oscillation as 1cm shorter and average ground contact time as 18ms longer.</p>

<p>I ran eight 400m laps for my second track run, and Garmin predictably stayed on point because it uses saved track maps to judge your likely location. OnePlus had more issues: the Watch 2R buzzed my wrist with lap or mile times at about the 350m mark, consistently. It was as if the starting point was completely wrong, but then the GPS was pinpoint-accurate when I hit that incorrect spot. Still, it threw my calculated pace off by a decent margin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4BrP6943h4EJGA2oK3nkuM" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-and-Garmin-Forerunner-965.jpeg" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2R (left) and Garmin Forerunner 965 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4BrP6943h4EJGA2oK3nkuM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I figured the heart rate for a hard-paced track workout would be the sticking point, but its HR average was more accurate than the Galaxy Watch Ultra during my track workout last week. It certainly fell short of Garmin&apos;s results — typically 1–3 bpm short at a given moment — but typically leveled out to the correct number given enough time. Certainly, the Watch 2R did much better than the Watch 2 in this area.</p><p>Again, OnePlus&apos; running dynamics data diverged from Garmin in small ways. I don&apos;t quite get how OnePlus said I took more steps per minute while leaving my feet on the ground for longer. However, I realized after my run that OHealth had my height listed as 5&apos;7 (I&apos;m 6&apos;1), so maybe that skewed the results for things like vertical oscillation. Regardless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running form data isn&apos;t worth obsessing over</a>, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="overall-oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-impressions-2">Overall OnePlus Watch 2R fitness impressions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dL65yD2j4NR4LL4X2UuTWL" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-heart-rate-summary.jpeg" alt="Post-run heart rate average and max on the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dL65yD2j4NR4LL4X2UuTWL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This might simply be a case of low expectations skewing my impressions, but the OnePlus Watch 2R feels like a strong budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>. It has a comfortable weight for its display size, three-day battery life with Wear OS 4, Google Assistant, and a $229 price tag that I&apos;d expect from an Amazfit watch — not something with proper app support.</p><p>OHealth provides some in-depth and surprisingly accessible data for running, offering detailed context for certain stats like training effect, running dynamics, VO2 Max, and recovery time — though Garmin wants me to rest an extra day and has my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> slightly lower. </p><p>That said, it&apos;s still quite basic compared to other tie-in fitness apps. OHealth provides a lot of individual run data, but its long-term training load and workout summary data is on the simplistic side. If I used the Watch 2R long-term, I&apos;d most likely auto-sync the data to Strava and rely on that instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR" name="oneplus-watch-2-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The OnePlus Watch 2 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Circling back to my colleagues&apos; complaints about the original OnePlus Watch 2, my final step count across both runs was 11,670 for the Forerunner 965 and 11,560 for the Watch 2R. </p><p>Garmin watches beat every other brand in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">first</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">second step-counting tests</a>, so I&apos;ll treat the first number as an accurate control group. About 100 steps off across 11,000 steps is almost a rounding error, and significantly better than the OnePlus Watch 2 vs. the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> across the same distance (1,860 short). The same goes for my recent Galaxy Watch Ultra test against the Forerunner 965 after 10,000 steps (348 steps short).</p><p>OnePlus did underreport my burned calories compared to Garmin, but to be honest, I&apos;ve <strong>never</strong> seen any two watch brands agree on how many calories you&apos;ve burned. I don&apos;t know what goes into that algorithm and how to tell which ones flatter or sell you short. So I&apos;m not too fussed about it looking like OnePlus is on the low end, since it&apos;s just an estimate.</p><p>Really, my biggest complaint with the OnePlus Watch 2R is the same one I have with the Galaxy Watch Ultra: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">lack of a crown</a>. OnePlus gave the Watch 2 an inactive crown that spins and does nothing, while the Watch 2 has two simple buttons, one of which pulls up workouts by default unless you change the shortcut. I do appreciate that, but the sweaty-stained displays in the pics above should show why I don&apos;t like relying on swipes during workouts. Give me up/down buttons or a crown any day.</p><p>I need more time for a full OnePlus Watch 2R review that dives deeper into the health and sleep side of things. But I&apos;m much more bullish about its chances of being worthwhile for casual athletes than I was a week ago -- and matching up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap Android watches</a> for quality.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R has a Snapdragon W5 CPU, 500mAh battery, 1.43-inch display, dual-band GPS, NFC tap-to-pay, Google Assistant, and detailed post-run metrics. It's not as stylish or rugged as the original Watch 2, but it's much lighter, more affordable, and seemingly lacks the same HR issues.</p></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>TECNO, a veteran in the Android world for more than a decade now, has made a name for itself in the budget smartphone market, especially in emerging regions. The Chinese company has been dipping its toes in the budget phone segment for the last several years, and now it has refreshed its Camon line with a new model.</p><p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G might not be the first device you think of when shopping for an affordable Android phone, but it&apos;s stepping into the ring regardless. Does it have the chops to challenge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">leading budget Android phones</a>? We&apos;re about to find out.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-camon-30-premier-5g-price-and-availability"><span>TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-02-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G rear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G retails for roughly $350, although price varies by market. The company says it is available to purchase across more than 70 countries, except the Western markets such as the United States. TECNO&apos;s markets include Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-camon-30-premier-5g-what-i-like"><span>TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WQgdgSnNbVbmDxD2ws7hNa" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-13-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G rear camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQgdgSnNbVbmDxD2ws7hNa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s most compelling attribute arguably lies within its camera system. This really shows TECNO&apos;s determination to earn the title of "flagship killer."</p><p>The phone is packed with a powerful quad-camera system, led by a 50MP Sony IMX890 main sensor. Supporting it are three additional 50MP cameras: a wide-angle lens for stunning landscapes, a macro lens for detailed close-ups, and a portrait lens. For selfies, there&apos;s a 50MP front camera with autofocus and eye-tracking capabilities.</p><p>TECNO&apos;s innovative PolarAce technology powers this impressive setup, featuring the Sony CXD5622G imaging chip. This chip is the first to offer "end-side FP16 floating-point computing with the power of 4.6TFLOPS@FP16."</p><p>The technical specs might sound complex, so let&apos;s break down what they mean for you. This phone promises sharper videos even in low light, thanks to AI noise reduction and HDR for balanced lighting. However, it&apos;s not all roses (more on that later). Regardless, the 4K portrait video feature allowed me to take high-resolution close-ups with a blurred background.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-02-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G rear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO might be throwing around a lot of technical terms for its camera system, but the key takeaway is this: it uses a powerful dual-chip setup, featuring a Sony imaging chip, to deliver noticeably improved photos.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s camera tries to balance natural colors with vibrant ones. Most photos, especially landscapes, look great, but I noticed that the AI sometimes oversaturates scenes with lots of blue sky and green grass, making them look a bit unrealistic.</p><p>still, the handset&apos;s camera versatility shines here. Even without portrait mode, the main sensor achieves a beautiful depth of field. Furthermore, the 3x optical zoom delivers detailed close-ups, and HDR technology ensures balanced exposure in various lighting conditions. This phone&apos;s camera is a clear contender in its class.</p>

<p>One area where the Camon 30 Premier 5G punches above its weight is the telephoto lens. Unlike many budget phones, it boasts a dedicated 50MP sensor with 3x optical zoom, capturing crisp close-up shots without sacrificing detail. The ultra-wide camera, while not the absolute widest available, delivers impressive detail and good color fidelity that complements the main sensor.</p><p>The front-facing camera doesn&apos;t disappoint either. Autofocus, a feature typically found in premium phones, ensures sharp and detailed selfies. Additionally, the camera captures natural-looking skin tones.</p>

<p>While the Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s camera system delivers good results overall, there&apos;s room for improvement. A slightly lighter touch with image processing, particularly regarding AI saturation in certain scenarios, could elevate photo quality to even greater heights.</p><p>The phone&apos;s display is a also feast for the eyes. Sharp resolution and a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate combine to create an immersive viewing experience that is perfect for devouring your favorite content.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oKjAkkzwUpTEPj6LTtE7uf" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-11-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKjAkkzwUpTEPj6LTtE7uf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display boasts a fairly impressive 1400 nits of peak brightness, ideal for conquering glare in bright outdoor environments. However, enabling auto-brightness is necessary to access this level, and its reliability wasn&apos;t always perfect in my testing.</p><p>Thankfully, everyday tasks like social media scrolling, app launching, and web browsing felt smooth, with only occasional hiccups. Even demanding games like Genshin Impact ran decently at medium graphics with 60fps, though I experienced minor stutters in rare instances.</p><p>Endurance isn&apos;t a concern with the Camon 30 Premier 5G. Packing a generous 5,000mAh battery, it delivered more than eight hours of screen-on time during light use. This translates to ample power for all-day tasks.</p>

<p>The device ups the ante with a speedy 70W charger included in the box. In my tests, it fueled the phone from empty to more than 50% in just 15 minutes, with a full charge taking around 40 minutes. That&apos;s impressive for a phone in this price range.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s design hints at a company pushing boundaries. Unboxing it reveals a phone that aspires to a more premium aesthetic. While its flat-edged metallic frame follows current trends, the phone really shines with its unique "Tech-Art Leather" back. This material, featuring a snowy motif, integrates with the matte plastic texture and silver frame, creating a captivating interplay of textures and visual intrigue.</p><p>Its camera module also reminds me of classic cameras. It features a fixed zoom ring around the lenses, adding a nostalgic touch and helping with heat dissipation, according to TECNO. That said, it does not have any practical function at all.</p><p>Enhancing the premium feel, the Camon 30 Premier 5G boasts TECNO&apos;s strongest aluminum frame yet, housed in a remarkably high-quality case included in the box.</p><p>Despite weighing 210g, the Camon 30 Premier 5G feels surprisingly comfortable in hand. This is likely due to its well-thought-out design that ensures balanced weight distribution.</p>

<p>While the TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G boasts impressive specs for photo capture, video recording is an area for improvement. Despite offering 4K resolution at 30fps or 60fps, stabilization falls short, particularly in low-light conditions. Footage can appear shaky, and even daytime recordings lack the smoothness I expected, even with a gimbal.</p><p>However, the biggest downside of the phone is its software. TECNO&apos;s HiOS 14 skin, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and the overall software strategy have several shortcomings that I can&apos;t overlook.</p><p>Although it&apos;s smooth and functional, the software is somewhat unattractive and cluttered with unnecessary apps, many of which can&apos;t be uninstalled. It&apos;s not just the number of apps but also the fact that most users won&apos;t recognize names like AHA Games, Ella, and Hi Theme.</p><p>Simply put, the old problem of bloatware is still present. You&apos;ll find the usual duplicate web browser, a custom voice assistant awkwardly running alongside Google&apos;s, and a separate app store.</p><p>TECNO&apos;s HiOS 14 introduces a mandatory TECNO account sign-up process, which some users might find inconvenient. Additionally, swiping left no longer brings up the familiar Google Discover feed; instead, it displays TECNO&apos;s own selection of widgets. These widgets, which include recently used apps and phone usage stats, might not appeal to everyone.</p>

<p>The company&apos;s update policy for the Camon 30 Premier 5G is also a concern. The phone is only promised two major OS upgrades, lagging behind competitors like Xiaomi, which offers three, and OnePlus, which offers four. Additionally, TECNO hasn&apos;t specified how often these updates will be released.</p><p>While the software experience has room for improvement, TECNO does introduce some interesting features. For instance, the built-in dialer app integrates a WhatsApp icon, allowing you to initiate direct messages without saving contacts beforehand.</p><p>TECNO pre-installs its Ella GPT AI assistant, too, offering an alternative to Google Assistant. While Ella GPT can handle basic tasks, it may not be suitable for complex instructions or extended conversations. Users seeking a more robust AI experience might prefer established options like Gemini or ChatGPT.</p><p>Another feature that caught my eye was the AI-powered wallpaper generator, similar to the one in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-note-40-pro-plus-review">Infinix Note 40 Pro Plus 5G</a> (this makes sense, given that both brands are owned by the same parent company). While many smartphone manufacturers are adding generative AI features, TECNO&apos;s approach is pretty unique, and I hope it becomes more popular.</p>

<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G is a solid choice in its price range. It packs features and performance that can go head-to-head with established models like the Samsung Galaxy A55 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus</a>, making it a great value for those watching their budget.</p><p>While boasting a slightly higher price point than the TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G, the Samsung Galaxy A55 positions itself as a reliable option. It excels in battery life and display quality, effortlessly handling everyday tasks. However, its camera system might not be the absolute strongest in this price range, and the absence of wireless charging may be a drawback for some users. In the end, the Galaxy A55 focuses on practicality rather than flashy features, appealing to those who want a dependable, no-frills phone.</p><p>Xiaomi steps up its mid-range game with the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus. The phone exudes a more premium aesthetic with its improved design and exceptional display.  This iteration welcomes back the crowd-pleasing features of rapid charging and a powerful main camera but retains the brand&apos;s well-documented software shortcomings. Despite this, the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus cements Xiaomi&apos;s position in the sub-$400 market, offering a solid option for budget-conscious consumers looking for a well-rounded device.</p>

This phone changes the game, allowing budget-conscious consumers to enjoy flagship-level technology without the hefty cost.</p><p>However, the Camon 30 Premier 5G has a few drawbacks, like aggressive color processing from the AI and some limitations in low-light photography.

<ul><li>The 41mm base Pixel Watch 3 model with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is rumored to start at €399.</li><li>Meanwhile, the LTE version of the 41mm model might be priced at €499, which is €100 more than the Pixel Watch 2 LTE.</li><li>The rumored Pixel Watch 3 XL could start at €449 for the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth model and €549 for the LTE version, marking the first time Google offers two sizes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak from a French site reveals the prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> and Pixel Watch 3 XL, and it&apos;s not looking good.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/google-pixel-watch-3-et-3-xl-voici-les-prix-europeens-et-toutes-les-configurations-des-montres-connectees-a-venir-en-aout-55581" target="_blank">Dealabs</a> claims that the base model (41mm) with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is expected to start at €399, matching the launch price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> in other markets (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-watch-3-xl-pricing-leaked-not-going-like/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>The leak also hints at a price hike for the LTE version of the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, which is expected to be priced at €499. This is a bump up from the Pixel Watch 2 LTE&apos;s launch price of €399. So, we&apos;re looking at an increase of €50 to €100, which might not sit well with budget-conscious buyers.</p><p>These prices might seem pretty high on their own, and even more so when you compare them to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">leading Android smartwatches</a> on the market. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 starts at just €319 for the Wi-Fi model and €369 for the LTE version.</p><p>The rumored Pixel Watch 3 XL isn&apos;t helping the price concerns, either. According to Dealabs, the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth model might start at €449, while the LTE version could be €549. This would be a first for Google, offering the Pixel Watch in two different sizes, if the rumors are accurate.</p><p>Interestingly, Dealabs points out that the official name for the larger model is still uncertain. While most leaks call it the Pixel Watch 3 XL, there&apos;s no official confirmation yet.</p><p>Dealabs also gives us a glimpse at the potential strap colors. The 41mm model might come in Hazel, Obsidian, Pink, and Porcelain. Meanwhile, the 45mm model could have fewer options, with just Hazel, Obsidian, and Porcelain.</p><p>Even though these European prices might not match up exactly in the US, it&apos;s likely that we&apos;ll see a similar price increase for the Pixel Watch 3 when it launches in the country.</p><p>Whether the price hike is worth it depends on what the Pixel Watch 3 offers. Besides the new XL model, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">probably won&apos;t see major design changes</a>. There&apos;s supposed to be a new chipset and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-fcc-listing-detailed">ultra-wideband upgrade for Watch Unlock</a>, but it&apos;s unclear how much these will improve things.</p><p>The exact release date for the Pixel Watch 3 is still up in the air, according to this source. While the Pixel 9 Pro is expected to be unveiled at the Made by Google event on August 13, the smartwatch might be released later in the year, separate from the phone launch.</p>

Microsoft recognized the ongoing disruption and expected a quick fix; however, it&apos;s up to CrowdStrike to fully resolve the issue.</p><p>President & CEO CrowdStrike George Kurtz posted on X, stating that CrowdStrike was working with customers impacted by the outage and apologized for the disruption.</p><p>"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on," Kurtz said.</p><p>For now, the update has been pulled, and the company has posted a temporary fix for this outage, which will boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>

First, Google posted a quick teaser on X, giving us a glimpse of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 Pro</a> in a champagne gold-like color. The device appears glossy, with rounded edges and a matte finish on its back panel.

The company showed off the phone&apos;s external display and its hinge mechanism when the phone is opened—and the rear camera module is set in a unique, rounded rectangular casing.</p><p>The teaser doesn&apos;t show the rumored top-right corner hole-punch front camera, which has left everyone speculating about where the phone&apos;s selfie camera will be placed. The Pixel Pro Fold comes in a sleek porcelain finish, which could come in multiple colorways.</p><p>We&apos;re hoping to see just surprise drops leading up to the Made by Google event set to take place on August 13 at 1 p.m. ET. </p>

The device comes loaded with the  AI Toolbox, which helps users accelerate their workflows. The device comes with a large 9,510mAh battery and a flash charging tech that recharges the device within 81 minutes.  The sleek 6.49mm and 584g pad features a Nimbus Gray all-metal body. It comes with add-on accessories like the OnePlus Stylo 2 and the OnePlus Pad 2 Smart Keyboard.</p><p>Now coming to the Watch 2R— it features an "ergonomic" design with two physical buttons on the side of its face, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a>. One button will quickly navigate to the user&apos;s stored watch apps, while the other is an "action" button for fitness tracking.

With a 500mAh battery, the wearable is said to deliver up to 100 hours of charge with regular use and comes with a 7.5W VOOC fast charger, which fully charges the device in 60 minutes. The watch is priced at $229 and comes in Forest Green and Gunmetal Gray colorways.</p><p>Lastly, the company also launched the Nord Buds 3 Pro, which comes with studio-grade audio with powerful bass tones and BassWave 2.0 technology. OnePlus stated that the earbuds "come with scenario-based Smart Noise Cancellation, which intelligently detects ambient sounds and selects the most suitable noise reduction mode in real-time to balance noise-canceling effectiveness and convenience." These affordable Buds have triple microphones that promise clear and stable audio while taking voice/video calls.  The new buds come in a pebble-shaped vertical case, which sports a matte finish with some metallic accents. They come in two colorways: Starry Black and Soft Jade.</p>

You probably weren&apos;t affected much (neither was I), but thousands of corporations and businesses were, including the airline and rail industry, bringing transportation and other services to a standstill. </p><p>Needless to say, it was messy and will end up costing the companies affected millions. Messy, expensive technical blunders are fascinating to me and one of the things I think is always worth exploring more. At the risk of sounding like the proverbial Monday morning quarterback, let&apos;s have a look at this one.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web&apos;s longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>While I think the overall blame must be laid at Microsoft&apos;s feet, the Redmond giant didn&apos;t cause this outage. An optional third-party Windows component from CrowdStrike—another Windows Security vendor—sent out an update that crashed the low-level systems of the affected computers and sent them into the famous Windows blue screen. The only thing Microsoft did wrong was build a system that allows this to happen, but this is also the most important part of what happened. </p><p>That should also be your biggest takeaway from this because the next time it happens—and there will be a next time—you could be affected, and it could be much worse. CrowdStrike may have caused this, but it was Microsoft&apos;s fault.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-cloudstrike-factor-into-all-of-this-2">How does CloudStrike factor into all of this?</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s talk a little more about what CrowdStrike is and why so many big companies use their products. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/about-us/">the company&apos;s website</a>, CrowdStrike has "redefined security", securing "the most critical areas of risk – endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data." I am definitely not a Windows security professional but I can recognize a sales pitch when I see one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664" name="windows-blue-screen-of-death.jpg" alt="A blue screen of death on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m sure the software offers an important service. I&apos;m equally sure that the decision to use what CrowdStrike offers is financially based as much or more than it is technically. Salesmen exist because they are good at selling a good or service and if the service is legitimate, it&apos;s a lot easier to do.</p>
<p>I have no problem with an entrepreneur finding a way to get the corporate world to buy into their product. I do find two things very concerning here.</p><p>Firstly, and most importantly, if CrowdStrike offers something so important, why is it not already a part of Windows Server? Microsoft is one of the biggest, and dare I say best, software companies in the world. If there is a legitimate need for a product like the ones CrowdStrike offers, Microsoft could provide it themselves. With Windows Server licensing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vanilla.tools/androidcentral/articles/FmEEbV4weBh2TVwpHWhhP7">being so expensive</a>, it probably <em>should</em> be provided.</p><p>My next concern is how an optional piece of software can get such low-level OS access and cripple a machine if it&apos;s corrupt or misconfigured. Microsoft should never allow software from another company to hijack its operating system this way.</p><p>This is why I&apos;ll place the blame for this particular outage on Microsoft even though the company did nothing to directly cause it. I&apos;m always going to hold the best companies to higher standards.</p>
<p>Neither of these ideas is crazy or new. I guarantee that engineers at Microsoft knew this could happen, looked at how it could be prevented, and analyzed what the company needed to do to "fix" them. It&apos;s trendy to hate on the company, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/using-android-microsoft-ecosystem">Microsoft is one of the best companies in the world</a> when it comes to computing, both at the edge and in the cloud. Even if you&apos;re not a fan of its products, you can easily see this. Critical infrastructure depends on Microsoft because it is so good at what it does.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-next-time-2">What about next time?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws" name="bricked-bootloader.jpg" alt="Things can go wrong when rooting your phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough with the amateur analysis, though. This is all concerning because we got off easy this time. Yes, your flight got canceled if you were traveling today, and maybe you had no cell service on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your new phone</a> for a few hours this morning. If you were lucky, you got to slack off instead of work at your office this morning. If you&apos;re unlucky, you get to spend the weekend repairing the damage the outage caused to your IT department.</p>
<p>What if, the next time, the national power grid goes down? Imagine an entire country in the dark for an extended amount of time because of a misconfigured kernel module from a third-party vendor. I know there are multiple fail-safes in place to prevent anything like this, but you should never say never. </p><p>More realistically, what if the next global outage affects mobile devices? Forget the inconvenience of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-not-just-you-gmail-youtube-and-other-google-services-are-down-right-now">Gmail</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158595/imessage-down-outage-iphone-apple-text-messages">iMessage</a> going down and instead imagine every Android or iPhone or Surface laptop crapping out for a few hours. It&apos;s easy to say it would be an opportunity to go outside and get some much-needed fresh air, but billions and billions of dollars would be lost, and entire companies would go bankrupt because of it.</p>
<p>I&apos;m certain that incidents like what happened this week are great educational tools and help prevent a more serious incident from happening. I hope the right people—the ones who control the purse strings—use them as a learning opportunity.</p>

Unfortunately, Google Maps is so ubiquitous that its recommendations can <em>cause</em> traffic-filled nightmares just as often as they help people escape them. </p><p>A few weeks back, I had a tech demo at Logitech&apos;s offices in North San Jose, which I scheduled early to beat the rush. I left at 1 pm with 50 miles and a little over an hour to get home. As I took off, I saw a warning about an accident on 680N, so I turned on an audiobook and got ready for a brief slowdown.</p><p>It took two and a half hours to make it back. I had traveled from 680 to 238 to 84, then onto surface streets for over ten miles, then to 580, 13, 24, and finally back to 680 before coming to my exit. <strong>Seven</strong> different highways (if you count 680 twice) full to the brim with rerouted Google Maps users.</p><p>Here&apos;s what happened. As I drove up 680, Google Maps warned me that the accident had caused a fifteen-minute slowdown and that exiting up ahead would save time. Since I didn&apos;t have anyone there to check Google&apos;s new route, I trusted the app&apos;s advice and exited. </p><p>So did everyone else, it turns out! The siren call of a "Faster route available" sent thousands of drivers onto a two-lane street with only one exit lane for a turn two miles down the road. Everyone crammed into that lane while all the drivers unfamiliar with this new route frantically cut in line miles ahead, causing a huge slowdown. After about 20 minutes to drive a couple of miles, Maps rerouted me again.</p><p>I won&apos;t bore you with a long, drawn-out description of a long, drawn-out drive. Suffice it to say that I very much regretted taking Google Maps&apos; advice instead of just sticking it out on the direct route. That would have probably saved me an extra hour of needless zig-zagging across the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Every friend or family member I&apos;ve asked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>&apos; "faster route available" had an immediate traffic horror story to share, where the app sent them on some obscure side-street route to avoid gridlock on a highway or expressway, only for things to slow to a crawl because a ton of other drivers took the exact same route on a road not designed for heavy use. I&apos;ve also seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1dr08ef/google_maps_rerouting_is_awful/">r/Google Maps</a> posts complaining about this.</p><p>Other times, people will carefully choose a specific route for a road trip or long haul with better scenery, more EV stations or rest stops, or better conditions for driving a large truck or RV — only for Google Maps to auto-reroute them to something "faster" unless you cancel the switch quickly enough. I&apos;ve found several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/161fw2d/google_maps_absolutely_needs_a_setting_to_turn/">Reddit</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/15y4ger/how_to_stop_google_from_changing_to_fastest_route/">posts</a> criticizing this very issue, with people suggesting tricks like adding extra stops just to prevent auto-rerouting.</p><p>Google Maps occasionally suggests that I "exit hop" or "freeway jump" in congested traffic, meaning I take an exit but stay in the left lane and reenter the freeway a mile ahead. It&apos;s a jerk move that only slows traffic down in the long run, but it&apos;s never clear that&apos;s what you&apos;re agreeing to do when Maps reroutes you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UVfa6JdcPQx4Udmx3pLhHN" name="google-maps-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-landscape.jpg" alt="Google Maps on Galaxy Z Flip" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UVfa6JdcPQx4Udmx3pLhHN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My main problem is that Google Maps&apos; algorithm doesn&apos;t seem to account for its own power to change the flow of traffic based on its wide reach. According to a MarketWatch study, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-popularity-united-states-study">70% of U.S. drivers use Google Maps</a> despite iPhones&apos; popularity here. So by observing that a road is empty, Maps changes that reality and shifts a ton of traffic to that new road, even though it ultimately won&apos;t be much faster for the <del>lemmings</del> drivers following its advice.</p><p>I emailed a Google Maps contact and asked them about the algorithm. Does it account for current traffic levels or a road&apos;s maximum capacity when it recommends a faster route? Are they aware of the drawbacks of the "faster route available" system—its engineers live in California, after all—and will Google&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> pivot lead to better recs down the line? As of yet, I haven&apos;t heard back.</p><p>Anecdotally, most of the people I&apos;ve asked about this say that they don&apos;t let Maps reroute them anymore. They choose a route when they leave, and if it slows down, they stick to the current route because they don&apos;t trust mid-route changes to pay off. Despite Google Maps&apos; smart reputation, this is one area where people have lost or are losing faith. </p><p>Many of Google&apos;s recent Maps updates have focused on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-ui-overhaul-stable-rollout">UI overhaul</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-details-gen-ai-search-maps">GenAI recommendations on where to go</a>. But rather than have Maps telling me about "places with a vintage vibe in SF," I&apos;d rather it focus on the fundamentals.</p><p>In my mind, Google Maps needs the "with great power comes great responsibility" talk. Sending a simultaneous signal to every Google Maps driver to converge on some backroad detour is a recipe for bottlenecks and further accidents. If Google can figure out how to be more prudent with its "Faster route available" recommendations, that&apos;ll make everyone safer and happier.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-charge-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip6-2">How can you charge the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, one of two new foldable phone models launched by Samsung at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Galaxy Unpacked event in July 2024</a>, can be charged in a number of ways. Along with wired charging at 25W via USB-C using a compatible cable and charger, it can also charge wirelessly. </p><p>The phone charges wirelessly at 15W, which is pretty much the industry standard rate. Thus, it can’t be charged as quickly as competing phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12</a>, which can charge wirelessly at a rapid 50W using a compatible AIRVOOC charger. However, it will do the trick. </p><p>It works with any wireless charging pad, stand, or surface, so go ahead and plop it down or atop one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">the best wireless chargers</a> to get a battery boost. Given the speed, don’t expect to be up and running quickly. But you can keep the phone on a wireless charging pad on your desk while you work through the day, for example, or give it a boost on a wireless charging surface at the airport before your flight. </p><p>Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers 4.5W reverse charging, which can be used to recharge other compatible devices, like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Samsung Galaxy Buds</a> or Galaxy smartwatch. As the name implies, it takes battery power from the phone and uses it to charge other devices, effectively functioning as its own charging pad. </p><p>Naturally, using reverse charging will drain your phone’s battery. But if you need to give your earbuds a quick boost to be able to listen to tunes or a podcast on the way home from work or school and your phone’s battery is full, this could be worth it for the top-up. Given the slow rate, however, this is something you’ll probably only use for emergencies and quick recharges to get you through a commute or to make a phone call. </p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that even with wired charging, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn’t charge very quickly, either. It only charges at a rate of 25W, which is much slower than many other phones, including Samsung’s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> non-foldable device. </p><p>Bottom line: make sure to keep this phone juiced up at all times, and invest in one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">the best portable battery packs</a> to bring along with you if you’re a power user.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be an advanced, premium foldable phone, but it lacks fast charging. While it does support wireless charging, the rate is pretty slow. The same goes for wired charging. It also works with reverse charging, however, so you can recharge compatible buds, smartwatches, and more.

This means you can safely wash dishes, have a shower, go for a quick dip in the water, or run in the rain with it on. But as with any water-resistant device, you should always take precautions.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-is-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-water-resistant-rating-2">What is the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 water-resistant rating?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> boasts both an IP68 and 5ATM water-resistance rating. The IP68 rating means that you can submerge the watch in up to a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. You could theoretically swim with it as well, as long as you aren&apos;t diving deep or staying submerged for a period longer than half an hour. </p><p>The 5ATM rating, meanwhile, refers to the pressure the watch can withstand. With this rating, the watch can withstand pressure up to a depth of 50 meters. So, it’s OK for swimming in a pool or at the lake, showering, relaxing in the bathtub, or light water or snow activities. But it isn’t for more intense water or snow activities. </p><p>Note that water-resistant ratings apply at the time of manufacture. This degrades over time so as with any other smartwatch (or other electronic device, for that matter) that has an IP68 or 5ATM rating, it will become more susceptible to water damage as it gets older. </p><p>What’s more, the rating relates to freshwater sources, so if you’re swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool, for example, or saltwater ocean, you might want to remove the watch to prevent damage, or invest in a waterproof casing for an added layer of protection. This rating also does not withstand high pressures of water, like while water skiing, nor high temperatures, like in a hot tub. Use your best judgement. </p><p>If you are swimming or doing outdoor activities in the rain or snow with the watch, make sure you also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">water-resistant band</a>.  </p><p>If you want something with a higher water-resistance rating and that’s more durable overall, you can consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> instead, which offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/is-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-waterproof">rating twice as high at 10ATM</a>. Otherwise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is just like any other premium smartwatch, and you can wear it with confidence just about anywhere. Just wear with caution when swimming, make sure to thoroughly rinse and dry it when you&apos;re done, and you&apos;re good to go!</p>

<p>As the latest Samsung Galaxy smartwatch in the line, the Galaxy Watch 7 boasts some enticing upgrades like an improved chip, dual-band GPS, and Sleep Apnea detection. It has the same IP68 and 5TAM rating, protecting it against both water and dust. But, like most other smartwatches, it isn’t completely waterproof. If you need something more serious in this department, consider the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra instead.  </p></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Meta Quest 4 and Quest 4s are coming in 2026, according to one report.</li><li>The Meta Quest Pro 2 will debut in 2027, confirming earlier reports on the pro-level headset sequel.</li><li>Meta is said to be cutting R&D costs for Reality Labs by 20% by 2026.</li></ul>
<p>While the Meta Quest 3 is only just about to celebrate its first birthday, a new report suggests that its successor will be headed to market in just two years from now. What&apos;s more, Meta is reportedly looking to release a Meta Quest 4s at the same time, debuting a premium and budget line at the same time.</p><p>That&apos;s opposed to Meta&apos;s current strategy, as the company is rumored to be debuting a budget-minded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> this Fall. The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/reality-comes-to-metas-reality-labs">The Information</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-quest-4-2026-quest-pro-2-2027-report/">UploadVR</a>) and is written by Wayne Ma and Kalley Huang. Ma has reported on several Meta leaks in the past that turned out to be true, which means there&apos;s a high likelihood of this report being quite accurate.</p><p>Releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> when the Quest 3 is just three years old might seem like a fast timeframe — especially if you&apos;re a console gamer who is used to 6-8 years between major Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo releases — but it falls right in line with the length of time between the Quest 2 and Quest 3&apos;s release.</p><p>The report also says that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> headset is still in the works for a 2027 release despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lg-made-meta-quest-pro-2-canceled">recent cancellation</a> of an LG-made prototype. Quest Pro 2 rumors have been all over the place recently, so it might be wise to take this one with a grain of salt.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A new pair of AR glasses and the Meta Quest 3s are supposed to debut this Fall, while the Quest 4 and Quest 4s are reported to appear in two years.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta is also said to start cutting Reality Labs&apos; budget by 20% between this year and 2026. Reality Labs is the group within Meta that&apos;s responsible for products like the Meta Quest and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses</a>, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta&apos;s Llama AI</a> and other behind-the-scenes developments.</p><p>Reality Labs has earned a reputation for spending lots of money despite churning out several successful products lately, including the Meta Quest line and the aforementioned Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Most recently, Reality Labs pulled in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-earnings-q1-2024">30% more revenue</a> than in previous quarters, showing continued growth in Quest headset sales and the VR market, as a whole.</p><p>Meta is said to be debuting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">new pair of AR glasses</a> this Fall in addition to the Meta Quest 3s. The launch of more products gives Reality Labs a chance to increase its revenue further and, combined with lower R&D spending, could be the way Meta finally makes the infamous division profitable.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve heard of Google developing a "Satellite OS" for Pixels for a while now, but a discovery shows it might cost you.</p><p>With enrolled testers getting their hands on Android 15&apos;s latest beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-satellite-sos-free-apk-teardown-3462798/">Android Authority</a> discovered something interesting about Pixel&apos;s SOS feature. Through an APK dive, it was seen that Google might charge users for its Satellite OS services after a brief free period.</p><p>A string in the code states, "Satellite SOS is included at no charge for two years." It seems that Google is eyeing an approach similar to Apple and its emergency services, which are also free for the initial two years.</p><p>Other information in the code details the Pixel Satellite SOS feature more by stating, "your name, email, phone number, location, device information, and emergency contact information" will be shared with 911. That data is given to satellite service providers, as well.</p><p>One final sentence within Android 15&apos;s code mentions updating your Pixel to receive support for the SOS function. This is an occurrence older Pixels, like the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, will likely see as the emergency service is coming with Android 15. By extension, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">Pixel 9 series</a> should have it ready and waiting.</p><p>Concrete information regarding <em>how much </em>Google intends to charge (if it does) for its SOS service is unknown.</p>

<p>The past few Android 15 betas have held informative insights into what Google has planned for its SOS feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-satellite-sos-ui-spotted">such as its UI</a>. Early walkthroughs were discovered, showing that users will be prompted to gain a "clear view of the sky" before activating their SOS services. Users will then need to locate the appropriate satellite through the on-display animation.</p><p>Users can retain text-based contact with their family and 911 services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-pixel-feature-spotted">after enabling the emergency SOS feature</a> within the settings.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-4-is-here-as-the-stable-release-gets-closer">Android 15 Beta 4</a> was released for enrolled testers yesterday (July 18) and pushes us ever closer to a full OS launch. One of its key changes was a switch from PNG-based emoji fonts to a vector format. Technically speaking, this ensures your emojis scale in size without sacrificing quality and becoming distorted or blurred.</p><p>Android 15&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> were in the spotlight once again alongside better app activity management. It seems the software can better allocate its resources to keep apps active only when prompted by the user.</p>
