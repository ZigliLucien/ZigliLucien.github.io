<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s latest entry to its cheaper Android phone segment is getting a flagship-level treat that might make you swoon.</p><p>The Korean OEM&apos;s latest A-series phone, the Galaxy A16 5G, has seemingly received a quiet launch as it appeared on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/nl/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a16-5g-blue-black-128gb-sm-a166bzkdeub/">Dutch website</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidplanet.nl/nieuws/samsung-galaxy-a16-officieel/">Android Planet</a>). This is the company&apos;s next iteration following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-listed-on-walmart">A15 5G</a>, which debuted in November 2023. The device takes this further with a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Similar to its predecessor, the Galaxy A16 5G sports a triple camera array, consisting of a 50MP primary lens, a 5MP ultrawide, and a 2MP macro camera. The selfie camera arrives at 13MP.</p><p>The internal processing and software of the A16 5G are turning heads as Samsung states it features an improved Octa-Core processor with 2.4GHz. More importantly, the device runs Android 14 with the promise of delivering six years of OS updates to consumers who purchase the device.</p><p>Samsung states on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/nl/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a16-5g-blue-black-128gb-sm-a166bzkdeub/">website</a> that the A16 5G is "future-proof" as users can grab six generations of major Android OS updates <em>and </em>security updates. Those who grab the 2024 budget device can expect updates until October 31, 2030 — if it&apos;s still in your pocket. It&apos;s worth mentioning that Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series observed seven years of Android OS updates and security patches.</p>

<p>Other internal specifications include the device&apos;s 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The company advises that only 109.3GB of that 128 number is "available." Additionally, the A16 5G has a microSD card slot with support of up to 1.5TB.</p><p>The battery remains unchanged as Samsung provides a 5,000mAh capacity brick with 25W charging. The company estimates this should give consumers around 16 hours of Wi-Fi and roughly 18 hours of video playback.</p><p>In the Netherlands, the Galaxy A16 5G arrives in dark blue, light green, and light gray. It seems there&apos;s also a gold hue available, but appears restricted to another unspecified region. Samsung&apos;s Dutch website states the device can be purchased for € 229, which is roughly $250. Unfortunately, the company has yet to debut the budget device in the United States nor has it officially declared its price.</p><p>The A16 5G is truly a "budget" device, much more so than Samsung&apos;s recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">Galaxy S24 FE</a> from September. What&apos;s more, we&apos;re still waiting on Android 15 (One UI 7), which will be the latest budget phone&apos;s first major OS update. Samsung confirmed the update will roll out in 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 series. However, those interested can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">check out this demo</a> showcased on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a> at SDC 2024.</p>

<p><em><strong>Larry asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Hi Jerry!</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>What is the actual difference between cheap earbuds and allegedly better brands like Sony and Apple?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I admit my hearing is no longer the best, but I can&apos;t tell the difference. My cheap wireless buds are quite reliable, pair well, and hold a charge. Why pay $200.00 for name brands?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Heya Larry! I have a confession to make here, and I want to start with it — I&apos;m a sucker for any discussion about headphones. I work with mobile tech for a living, but headphones are my one true hobby that eats every bit of extra cash I have, so I was super happy to see this question come into my inbox. :)</p><p>With so many different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">brands of wireless earbuds</a> to choose from at every imaginable price point, this is an important question. Not everyone wants (or can afford) to spend a lot of money on them, but there are some very real differences. These may make a difference to some people. I think of three places where a more expensive brand can differentiate itself: sound, features, and comfort.</p>

<p>It&apos;s tough to make a pair of earbuds that sound great because everything is so little inside of them, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-why-is-bluetooth-bad">Bluetooth can be a mixed bag</a> to begin with. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wired-earbuds-are-making-a-comeback-and-im-excited">wired earbuds</a>, and some of them sound absolutely incredible, but those are for another article. I&apos;m talking about wireless Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>More expensive sets will probably use better quality drivers with more range between the highs and lows. Our ears can hear very small differences in frequency (especially when we&apos;re young) so being able to cover a broader range can make a big impact in what we hear. The quality differences in miniature parts can be quite dramatic. While the differences in sound quality aren&apos;t as apparent to you, for many, they are. Higher prices come with better audio quality because the parts are more expensive and the design costs are higher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FdnSbvNWPZ6KB2uTG8YLnA" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-buds-compared.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdnSbvNWPZ6KB2uTG8YLnA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another big difference can be the "extra" features. Things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">noise cancellation</a> and audio passthrough are relatively expensive additions that require extra hardware and added design costs. Other brands go a step further and add specialized buttons or logic to work with voice controls. To top it off, none of this should interfere with the audio quality.</p><p>When you add up the few extra dollars here and there, then bundle all the costs associated with adding the features, getting them to work as intended, and then testing it all, the retail prices rise. Personally, I don&apos;t need the features you would find in something like the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/are-airpods-good-earbud-choice-android-users">AirPods</a>, but a lot of people find them indispensable and don&apos;t mind paying extra for them.</p>
<p>Finally — and I think this is important to <em>everyone</em> — you want your earbuds to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ultimate-ears-fits-review">a comfortable fit</a> that stays in place. We&apos;ve all had a pair of earbuds that kept popping out, and it can be infuriating, especially when your hands are full or you&apos;re exercising.</p><p>A lot of thought goes into a good design that works for most people, but it still never works for everyone. Proper fit also affects sound quality as earbuds are engineered so that the driver is a specific distance away from the inner ear workings.</p><p>There are plenty of different ways a company can try to ensure a proper fit, like including multiple sets of tips or using a hooked-over ear design, but there is still plenty of design work involved. I think this is the most important feature of any headphones and I&apos;m willing to pay extra for a pair that fits "just right" and plenty of people agree with me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B4zMjKk37aNGkUggLPzQcU" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-wet.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 8 Active earbuds loose and wet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B4zMjKk37aNGkUggLPzQcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It sounds to me like you&apos;re lucky — you found a pair of cheap earbuds that work great for you. I&apos;d suggest you splurge for an extra pair in case you lose them and can&apos;t find them for sale later! I used to have an old pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/soundcores-discounted-liberty-air-2-true-wireless-earbuds-are-affordable-alternative-airpods">Soundcore</a> earbuds that weren&apos;t very expensive and I loved them. I found out they stopped making them after I dropped one of the pair into Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>No earbuds are best for everyone, and some people will spend more than others on them. Once you&apos;ve found a set that works for you, make sure to try and buy something very similar when it&apos;s time to replace them. And try not to drop them in the ocean!</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly rolling out several new features for Android under the "Theft Detection" moniker.</li><li>The updates include "Theft Detection Lock," which is an AI-powered lock screen that seeks out motion akin to someone snatching and running off with your device.</li><li>Offline Lock gives users remote control over their device if it's stolen and Offline Lock is a useful backup if a thief shuts off your phone's Wi-Fi or cell signal for too long.</li><li>Google previously teased these features during I/O 2024 alongside several more security measures in the works, like "Private Spaces" for Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports suggest that Google is starting to roll out some new security features for Android, which were teased during I/O 2024.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1842388241410146359">Mishaal Rahman on X</a> states Google has started pushing three new Theft Protection features: Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and Remote Lock. The features were originally spotted on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro</a> in the U.S., but additional reports by other users claim Google&apos;s pushed the security enhancements globally. </p><p>Google highlighted several features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">to safeguard user data</a> and sensitive information on Android in May. The company wrapped the new tools under a "Theft Protection" banner, which included the AI-powered screen lock known as "Detection Lock." Google stated during I/O 2024 that, when enabled, this feature would look for motions akin to someone snatching your device and running off.</p><p>If your phone detects this, it will lock itself for protection.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These three features actually appear to be rolling out globally, judging by all the replies I've received! https://t.co/IAj8NLcST0<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1842567056505688435">October 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Remote Lock is similar; however, this version lets users lock their phone (you guessed it) remotely. The initial announcement stated that users would need their phone number to complete this, as well as the completion of a security challenge. Devices running Android 10 and newer are eligible to receive this feature.</p><p>Rounding out the update is "Offline Lock." Malicious persons who&apos;ve taken your device offline (Wi-Fi, cell data) for a "prolonged" time will lose access to the phone. Moreover, if they attempt to guess your password and fail too many times enables further locking parameters. Android 10 and newer devices are eligible for this feature.</p><p>Users have noticed these features in India, Germany, and the EU alongside the U.S. However, it&apos;s worth noting that some users have not seen all three features in various regions, likely indicating Google&apos;s continuous rollout.</p><p>The other side of that major security post from May was "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a>." This secluded area on your device functions similarly to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/files-google-gets-pin-protected-safe-folder-hide-your-personal-files">Safe Folder</a>. Inbound for Android 15, users can set up a Private Space on their phone to hide away apps with sensitive information (like health and banking) behind a unique PIN. Elsewhere, Google stated it was looking into safeguarding your one-time passwords.</p><p>The company teased it was working on bolstering its Android fraud protections and expanding the software&apos;s Restricted Settings.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re due for our yearly Qualcomm Summit, but this leak isn&apos;t passing us by as new information surfaces about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4.</p><p>The alleged specification sheet for the upcoming flagship SoC was highlighted on X by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1842789635707285562">Jukanlosreve</a> as it appeared on Baidu (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-gen-4-massive-specifications-sheet-components-layout-leaked/">WCCFTech</a>). The screenshots provided show that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 may arrive in two variants: SM8750 and SM8750P. The primary difference (so far) is that the former is the only one to support both mmWave and sub-6 5G.</p><p>Graphically, the leaks claim the SoC will be paired with the Adreno 8-series GPU. The alleged sheet states it&apos;ll support displays up to 3,840x2,560 resolution at a max 144Hz refresh rate. Display processing rumors add that it&apos;ll include HDR10/10+, HDR Vivid, Dolby Vision HDR, and FP16 blending support.</p><p>The publication noted that the sheet suggests the SD 8 Gen 4 will support "the older" LPDDR5X RAM standard instead of the previously assumed LPDDR6. Moreover, the flagship chip will supposedly bring swift memory writing speeds to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> storage support. The screenshots purport users and OEMs may experience 4,500MB reading and 4,000MB writing speeds.</p><p>AI was the name of the game during Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC launch and it seems like that&apos;s continuing this year. Aside from the already confirmed use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Oryon CPU</a>, the leaked specs state the "Hexagon Tensor Processor" will provide some "AI use cases." Such uses are said to be generative AI, noise reduction, super-resolution, image enhancement, and more.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the spec sheets for the 8G4 have been leaked.https://t.co/ibBsIJ444C<a href="https://twitter.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1842789635707285562">October 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>SD 8 Gen 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">rumors have swirled</a> for a while, especially those suggesting it&apos;ll clock out at 4.0GHz with those Oryon CPU cores. Those same rumors claimed the chip would be paired with (specifically) the Adreno 830 GPU, which we&apos;ve seen doubled down in the latest alleged spec sheet. The SoC reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">appeared for its benchmark test</a> in February and seriously laid down the rubber.</p><p>From the test, it was rumored that the Adreno GPU hit a strength higher than Apple&apos;s M2.</p><p>Other rumors theorize that the SoC will see the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">Snapdragon X80 5G </a>Modem-RF system for communication purposes. The latest seventh-generation will, of course, provide 5G capabilities, but also satellite communication as more devices adopt the useful safety feature.</p><p>We won&apos;t have to wait that much longer as Qualcomm confirmed its Summit would occur in October. That event will hold the debut of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 as we await the next-generation of flagship phones to sport it.</p>

<hr>
<p>A OnePlus executive has confirmed the OnePlus 13 will have magnetic wireless charging, potentially making it the first Android flagship with a MagSafe-like feature.</p><p>OnePlus President and COO, Kinder Liu, recently shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/OAgy2rHBn?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a> screenshot of a chat where a fan asked if bamboo cases will make a comeback for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13-confirmed-to-have-magnetic-wireless-charging.898092.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p><p>Liu made it clear that there are no plans at the moment to bring back bamboo cases for the upcoming flagship model. However, he did confirm that wood-grain finish covers will be available, and they’ll feature a "magnetic suction function," hinting at the OnePlus 13&apos;s support for magnetic wireless charging.</p><p>The new OnePlus feature can be seen as the company&apos;s take on Apple&apos;s MagSafe, which has been a staple on iPhones since the iPhone 12 series. While MagSafe started as an Apple-only feature, the new open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2 charging standard</a>, co-developed by Apple, now opens the door for any brand to implement magnetic wireless charging. This is made possible by the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP), which takes cues from Apple’s MagSafe design.</p><p>MagSafe and the Qi2 standard have brought a fresh perspective to wireless charging, making it more versatile and functional. Yet, even with these improvements, the adoption of Qi2 among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">popular Android phones</a> remains relatively low.</p><p>Even with a surge of Qi2 accessories available today, the HMD Skyline stands out as the only (mid-range) Android smartphone to fully embrace this technology. Nevertheless, it&apos;s not yet clear if the OnePlus 13 will actually support the Qi2 standard.</p><p>The OnePlus 13&apos;s magnetic charging isn’t a huge surprise, especially since its sister brand, OPPO, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-magnetic-charging-leaked-camera-module">rolling out similar tech in the upcoming Find X8 series</a>. OPPO is also working on various magnetic accessories, like a portable power bank. This means OnePlus 13 users can look forward to an ecosystem that opens up even more charging options.</p><p>Reputable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OtA9SiGzE" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a> previously shared that OnePlus was developing magnetic cases with wireless charging for the OnePlus 13. There are also rumors about a magnetic snap-on cooling accessory to help with heat dissipation.</p><p>However, the leaker mentioned that these devices might not support "true magnetic wireless charging" because of patent limitations, likely tied to Apple&apos;s MagSafe patents.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is expected to launch in China later this year, possibly around late October. However, the global market will probably have to wait until next year for its release, following the trend of previous models.</p>

It has a brighter display, a longer-lasting battery with 100W charging, and top-notch gaming performance. Plus, its cameras have seen major upgrades, putting them close to the Pixel 9's quality.</p></p>

It isn't quite as powerful as the DS224+, but you still get access to a terrific software suite, and it is a reliable choice if you're just getting started. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1774147-REG/synology_ds223j_2_bay_nas_enclosure.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="0a90b99b-ba4f-439e-8b8f-37a067c46710" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Synology DiskStation DS223j: $189" data-dimension48="Synology DiskStation DS223j: $189">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The F4-423 is a terrific 4-bay choice if you want to set up a Plex server. It has hardware transcoding, dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports, 4GB of RAM, and you can slot in four 20TB drives, taking total addressable storage to 80TB. I used it extensively over the course of the last year, and it is an easy recommendation if you need a powerful 4-bay NAS. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VLFYWFY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="50d00ba8-3424-4923-a4f9-285fef4b4397" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$459" data-dimension48="$459">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The F2-423 is nearly identical to the F4-423, with the biggest difference being two drive bays instead of four. If you don't see yourself using the additional drive bays, the F2-423 is a phenomenal value at just $239. The rest of the hardware is identical, and you get the same dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, 4GB of RAM, and same software. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-Performance-Quad-core-Network-Diskless/dp/B09VLDQFVJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dfa37a81-d372-479d-bdca-94acb1159b33" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="TerraMaster F2-423: $299" data-dimension48="TerraMaster F2-423: $299">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-nas-should-i-buy-xa0-2">Which NAS should I buy? </h2>
<p>The first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you&apos;re going to need. That sets the basis for whether you should get a two-bay, four-bay, or a larger NAS server.</p><p>Synology is the largest manufacturer of NAS servers, and it sells dozens of products across various categories. Synology is known for its high-quality offerings, and its products are built to last. But the defining feature of Synology&apos;s NAS models is the software, with the web-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-manager-70">DiskStation Manager</a> setting the standard for this category.</p><p>If this is the first NAS you&apos;re buying and you don&apos;t want to invest a lot of money into a server, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds223j-review">DS223j</a> is a great starter choice. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DiskStation DS224+</a> is the upgrade pick if you want a powerful 2-bay home NAS, and if you&apos;re setting up a home Plex server, you should just get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> instead. </p><p>If you need multi-Gigabit connectivity, look to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f4-423-review">TerraMaster F4-423</a>; it has great hardware, good software, and plenty of configurability. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-hard-drive-for-my-nas-xa0-2">How do I choose a hard drive for my NAS? </h2>
<p>Choosing the right hard drive for your NAS is just as vital as selecting the right enclosure. As NAS enclosures are designed to run 24/7, there are NAS-focused hard drives available in the market. These models feature vibration resistance and are designed to handle the stresses of a 24/7 environment, and differ from your regular hard drives.</p><p>Another factor to consider when choosing a NAS hard drive is the speed. HDDs are usually available in either 5400rpm or 7200rpm, and the latter delivers better performance because the spindle moves at 7,200 rounds per minute. I&apos;ve used 5400rpm drives in NAS enclosures tailored for media streaming for years without any issues, but if you&apos;re building a more enthusiast-focused NAS and are looking for better performance, pick a model with a 7200rpm. </p><p>There are several NAS-focused hard drive product lines, with WD Red Plus and Seagate IronWolf dominating the sales charts. With drives starting out at 1TB and going all the way to 20TB, there&apos;s no shortage of options available across either product line. I&apos;d recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-Internal-Hard-Drive/dp/B084ZV4DXB">8TB IronWolf</a> if you&apos;re just starting out. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-october-prime-day-2">When is October Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon&apos;s second Prime Day sale event of the year, Prime Big Deal Days begins on October 8th and runs through the 9th. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-buy-products-during-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to buy products during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Yes, the vast majority of October Prime Day deals will only be available to Prime subscribers. If you&apos;re interested in buying products during the sale and you aren&apos;t a member just yet, we recommend taking advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can get the benefits of Prime Day without paying a cent. Alternatively, you could just wait and see if Amazon&apos;s biggest rivals will launch rival sales that don&apos;t require a membership. </p>

<p>Chances are that when you think about smart lights, the brand that comes to mind first is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/philips-hue" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/philips-hue">Philips Hue</a>. The product line was introduced way back in 2012 and has arguably maintained its status as the dominant brand in the smart lighting space to this day.</p><p>Even though Philips Hue makes a lot of different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-must-have-smart-home-accessories">smart lighting devices</a> like bulbs, light strips, and even lamps, this bulb is an easy entry point into this rather expansive ecosystem. You can get the Philips Hue A211,600 Lumen Bulb for a reasonable price and put it pretty much anywhere in your home. You can adjust from thousands of shades of white light and control it by voice using Alexa (or Google Assistant) with a compatible smart speaker.</p><p>While you need the Hue Hub (sold separately) to control the bulb remotely from the app, you can still control up to 10 lights in a room when in range, thanks to built-in Bluetooth technology. This means you can get a feel for smart lighting before deciding to opt for the Hue Hub to extend the experience. With the app and voice, you can create/activate scenes, use preset light recipes, dim the lights, and more. With a Hub, you can even control up to 50 lights at once!</p><p>But what sets this bulb apart is the ultra-bright 1,600 lumens that can light up any room to the max, whether it&apos;s for applying makeup or shaving in the bathroom, or making cooking videos in the kitchen.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re just getting started with smart lighting and want to dip your toes in the water with an easy-to-use, inexpensive bulb that is pretty much just plug-and-play, then I recommend you take a look at the Wyze Bulb. Wyze is a smart device company that has made a name for itself by providing quality products at low prices that work well with Alexa and the other smart assistants and protocols out there.</p><p>What&apos;s great about Wyze Bulbs is that they&apos;re affordable, well-made enough that they won&apos;t die on you in three months, and easy to use and install. All you have to do is screw it into a lamp or light fixture, connect it to your Wi-Fi through the free app, and ask Alexa to discover new devices. Once found, you can add that device to a room group, create routines, or control the brightness or on/off status with your voice.</p><p>If you are a creature of habit and want to put the same brand of bulbs throughout your house, you might be out of luck here. Wyze offers both standard bulbs in two varieties — white and color — along with an LED light strip. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wyze-bulb-color-review">Wyze Color Bulb review</a>, we were impressed with the color saturation even at high brightness. These are excellent bulbs to check out, especially when trying to keep costs down.</p>

<p>Ring is a trusted, smart home brand known more for its easy-to-setup <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ring-stick-cam-review">security cameras </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-ring-doorbell">video doorbells</a> versus lighting. However, the brand offers a range of smart lights, too, including this affordable A19 replacement bulb that offers 800 lumens (60-watt equivalent) of brightness for your room.</p><p>Since Ring is owned by Amazon, it&apos;s no surprise that it works with Alexa for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-control-your-lights-amazon-alexa">voice control</a>. Still, it requires the purchase of the Ring Bridge separately if you want to enjoy smart features like mobile notifications, setting schedules, turning lights on and off remotely, and more using the app. Luckily, if you have an Amazon Echo 4th gen or Echo Show 10 3rd gen, those will work as a bridge. You can even get a bundle with an Echo 4th gen when you buy from Amazon.</p><p>What&apos;s particularly great about this bulb is that it can be grouped with other Ring lights to create what the company calls a "Ring of Security" in your home. So if you place them in covered outdoor fixtures around the perimeter of your home, for example, you can keep an eye on everywhere from the backyard to the front door and driveway and control all the lights together. It&apos;s also compatible with other Ring devices so that you can control the lights alongside the security camera at your front door.</p>

<p>The best feature of this bright and vibrant bulb is how you don&apos;t need a hub of any kind to connect it to your home&apos;s Wi-Fi network: it connects directly so that you can get going right out of the box. However, you are paying a premium for that convenience.</p><p>The 1,100-lumen (75-watt) equivalent bulb provides dimmable light in up to 16 million different colors to set the mood based on your activity, whether you&apos;re reading a book, having a casual dinner party, or dancing the night away. The lights are dimmable as well, so you can get the right color or shade of white and at the right level to meet your needs.</p><p>Suitable for use both indoors and out, thanks to the weather-resistant design, the bulb is an excellent option if you want color options and to get going right away. I&apos;ve been using LIFX bulbs for years because I love how bright and saturated the colors can be, but I have consistently had periods of time where the bulbs go offline and I have to reconnect them. </p>

<p>Just like with smart light bulbs, it is easy to become overwhelmed by options for smart LED strips when searching on Amazon. Despite this, we keep coming back to these bulbs from Govee. They&apos;re affordable, easy to install, and work great with Alexa.</p><p>These LED strip lights can be used indoors, in an office, or in a kid&apos;s room, and while these particular strips aren&apos;t weatherproof enough for use outside on the porch — Govee does offer outdoor options. This LED light strip uses RGBIC technology which allows you even further control over what colors are displayed via the excellent Govee app. Pick a single color for the whole strip, change sections to different colors,  pick an exciting pre-made theme in the app, and much more.</p><p>These energy-efficient LED strip lights can adhere to just about any smooth surface with the included adhesive tape. You can control the lights and set up to 16 million different color combinations via the app or your voice with Alexa by enabling the Govee Alexa Skill. </p>

<p>WiZ may not be familiar to you, but its parent company, Philips, is. Fill your home with color with these bulbs that can display more than 16 million colors and shades of white, from candlelight to daylight, you can set the mood for any occasion with ease. </p><p>Another great thing about this bulb is that you don&apos;t need a hub — it connects directly to your home Wi-Fi network. While these bulbs are compatible with Amazon Alexa (and Google Assistant), the WiZ companion app is fantastic and full of great features to get the light just how you want it. You can turn the lights on and off, dim or brighten them via vocal commands or by the app, set scenes and routines, put lights on a schedule, and more.</p><p>The WiZ is a standard A19 size, so it can replace most bulbs in your home, but it&apos;s best for lamps and fixtures. You&apos;ll get 800 lumens of brightness which will be perfect for most situations. Plus, with these bulbs being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-cheap-smart-led-light-bulbs">best budget smart lights</a>, you can put smart lights in more places.</p>

<p>This uniquely-shaped light bulb, Rhombicosidodecahedron (a near-spherical shape made up of squares, triangles, and pentagons) as Nanoleaf calls it, is the perfect one for your desk or table lamp, providing 806 lumens of brightness to replace a standard 60-watt incandescent bulb. Plus, it offers the added benefit of 16+ million colors when you want the lighting to match your mood and a range of whites.</p><p>Thanks to Bluetooth, you don&apos;t need a hub — just connect these lights directly with the Nanoleaf app to your compatible Android or iOS device, and you&apos;re off to the races. You can control lights from the app, either individually or in groups, turning them on and off, changing colors, dimming, and more. While it&apos;s great, you don&apos;t need a hub to use these bulbs; you won&apos;t be able to control them when you are out of Bluetooth range.</p><p>The light bulb is super easy to set up, and if you have an Alexa-enabled smart speaker, you can control it by voice, too. It also works with Apple HomeKit and Google Assistant. Another great thing about these bulbs is they&apos;re Thread-enabled making them even more futureproof.</p>

<p>While we rate the Philips Hue A211,600 Lumen Bulb the best overall pick, when you&apos;re ready to step up your smart home, this bulb is a solid choice. It provides 16 million colors and different shades and temperatures of white. While you need the Hue Hub to control them remotely, they do work with Bluetooth for app control while you are within range. You can control up to 10 Hue Bluetooth/Zigbee bulbs from the app or up to 50 lights with the Hub.</p><p>When you&apos;re ready to set up a fully smart home, these bulbs can integrate with other Hue products, including other types of lights, as well as accessories like motion sensors and smart switches. In addition to controlling everything in the app, including turning lights on and off, dimming, creating scenes and routines, and grouping lights together, you can also control them by voice using Alexa with a compatible smart speaker.</p><p>The A19-sized bulb is also Energy Star-qualified, making it far more energy-efficient than old incandescent bulbs — as you&apos;d expect from one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-light-bulb">best smart lights</a> out there.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t get much easier than this simple soft white A19 bulb that you simply screw into the socket of your light, download the app, connect to Wi-Fi, and go — no hub needed. You can control it from the Kasa app, including turning it on and off, dimming, creating scenes, and setting schedules.</p><p>Offering 800 lumens of brightness for the equivalent of a 60-watt bulb, it can also be controlled by voice via Alexa (with a compatible smart speaker) as well as Google and Microsoft Cortana.</p><p>It&apos;s a simple bulb from a trusted brand that won&apos;t break the bank. So, while it might not be the ideal option to outfit an entire house, if you just want to update one or two bulbs in the home, it&apos;s a good choice.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>There are so many great options when it comes to the best Alexa-controlled light bulbs and setting up your smart home lighting. Some of the lights are better suited for indoor use, while some will work better outdoors. Some are more general-purpose lighting solutions, while other lights may be best suited for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-dark-spaces">very dark spaces</a>, specific rooms, or festivities.</p><p>For me, when it comes down to balancing the expandability of a smart lighting solution with the overall functionality, the best option to get started with is the Philips Hue A21. Philips Hue set the standard for what a quality smart light should be, and the company has always been interested in making sure that its products work with smart assistants like Alexa. And this bulb comes with a comprehensive ecosystem of products it can work with once you decide to expand your home. Plus, it&apos;s literally the brightest of the bunch.</p><p>But examine your specific needs to find the right bulb for you. There are also some great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-philips-hue-alternatives-your-home">Philips Hue alternatives</a> to consider. Decide if you&apos;re willing to pay extra for a hub or bridge or some kind or if you&apos;d prefer to get going right out of the box, though you&apos;ll likely be paying more in this case. Whatever you choose, it&apos;s wise to start with one or two bulbs and go from there, opting for an easily expandable brand so if you find you love the idea of smart lighting, you can add it to every room of your home, little by little. Maybe even consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-must-have-smart-home-accessories">adding more compatible smart products</a> to the equation over time as you build up your smart home, from sensors to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa">doorbells</a>.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp announced two new features to the platform, which are heavily inspired by Instagram.</li><li>Users can now share statuses with private mentions, and the mentioned person will get a discreet notification.</li><li>Plus, mentioned users can share the Status on their own profiles and even give it a like.</li><li>Users on the receiving end will now be able to like WhatsApp Statuses of all in general.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp rolled out Status updates a while back, similar to Instagram Stories. It&apos;s another fun way to stay connected with friends and family by sharing quick videos or photos that disappear after 24 hours. Now, the feature is getting a cool update to make it even more engaging.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/share-the-love-on-whatsapp-status">recent blog post</a> from WhatsApp, users can now receive likes on their Status updates. The experience and interface appear familiar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram-stories">Instagram Stories</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you can now 'Like' their Status 💚 it's an easy and quick way to say hey pic.twitter.com/HWoImCP8rz<a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1841872541545341143">October 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Just like Instagram Stories, users can now reshare their friends&apos; WhatsApp Status updates if they&apos;re mentioned privately, which is new to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging platform</a>.</p><p>In keeping with WhatsApp&apos;s signature green, the like/heart button for reactions will also be green, unlike the usual red or pink seen on other platforms. Plus, these likes will remain private.</p><p>"Status likes are private and don&apos;t have a counter, so only the person whose status you liked can see them as a  in the list of viewers," WhatsApp notes in the blog post. </p>
<p>For mentions, WhatsApp users can tag close friends in their Status updates, allowing them to reshare the Status if they choose. The mentioned person will get a private notification, and the mention won’t be visible to anyone else on the user&apos;s contact list.</p><p>These new features were spotted in testing a few weeks ago, and it&apos;s exciting to see them already rolling out. WhatsApp confirmed it&apos;s a global rollout, so Android and iOS users should see the update soon.</p><p>Not very long ago, WhatsApp also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-to-add-one-minute-video-status-updates">rolled out</a> another Instagram Stories-like feature: the ability to share longer video status updates. Previously, users could share only 30-second videos; however, after the update, users are able to share up to one minute video, just like Instagram, which isn&apos;t surprising since both are Meta-owned platforms.</p>

<p>To call rucking the hottest fitness trend of 2024 feels like an understatement. I&apos;ve seen rucking write-ups across mainstream and tech blogs, all proclaiming how walking with a military backpack has massively improved their fitness within weeks (or even days) and that you "need" to try it yourself.</p><p>Seeing this unrestrained rucking enthusiasm from other sites refocused my angle for this column. Unfortunately, I need to temper people&apos;s expectations a bit.</p><p>The concept of rucking is simple: Walking has cardiovascular benefits, but if you put on a heavy rucksack, your heart will hit higher, fat-burning zones, your upper and lower body muscles will develop, and even your bone density will improve without taking that much extra time or being as high-impact as running.</p><p>I&apos;ve rucked occasionally for the past two months, and I&apos;d wholeheartedly recommend <em>some</em> people try it. Rucking makes me nostalgic for my Boy Scout days doing 50-mile hikes in the Sierra Nevadas — except I get to drive home and eat proper food afterward.</p><p>That said, too much rucking coverage exaggerates its positives and ignores its downsides. Not everyone needs to imitate military recruits to get healthier. So, let&apos;s dive into why I like rucking, and I want to make sure new converts to the cult of rucking don&apos;t have regrets later.</p>
<h2 id="light-rucking-is-the-perfect-challenge-for-hikers-and-runners-2">Light rucking is the perfect challenge for hikers and runners</h2>
<p>The big hurdle for rucking is the upfront cost. Unlike my fellow journalists who probably got gifted or expensed Goruck packs, I had to decide whether to spend $300–400 on a proper rucksack with fancy support straps and designed pouches for weight plates, as r/Rucking users recommend, or use a "normal" backpack and risk straining my lower back.</p><p>Instead, I repurposed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rei.com/product/176899/rei-co-op-ruckpack-18-recycled-daypack">18L REI daypack</a> I&apos;d bought to carry water and trail mix. It&apos;s not rugged enough for true support or a ton of weight, but I could fit two 10-pound plates and a rolled-up towel behind them in the laptop sleeve so that the weight stayed close to my back and didn&apos;t bounce around as I trekked up and down steep hills. </p>

<p>As a runner who&apos;s never been into strength training, I don&apos;t have much defined muscle, so entry-level rucking is perfect cross-training for me. It tricks me into enjoying a total-body workout by distracting me with nature and cardio, it gives my feet a break from runs, and it helps me get low-aerobic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> — aka prolonged time in heart rate zones 1 and 2 — for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">building up my VO2 Max</a> foundation so I can push harder on my regular runs.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goruck.com/blogs/news-stories/the-beginners-guide-to-rucking">Goruck beginner&apos;s guide</a> recommends working your way up to 1/3 of your body weight, starting at 20 pounds and adding five extra pounds per week for short walks until you reach this goal. I&apos;d recommend starting even lighter (maybe 10 pounds?), then stopping at around 20 pounds until you&apos;ve rucked enough to justify shelling out for proper gear.</p>
<h2 id="don-apos-t-ruck-before-you-can-walk-2">Don&apos;t ruck before you can walk</h2>
<p>Without calling out any specific writers or sites, I&apos;ve seen tons of headlines about rucking for "10,000 steps a day," or rucking every day for weeks, and having immediate benefits to strength, endurance, and mental health.</p><p>Look, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">I walked 10,000 steps a day for a month</a> last year before I&apos;d even heard of rucking. I lost weight, built up a higher VO2 Max for endurance, and felt much happier — though the walks did get boring after a while. Sound familiar, minus the strength training?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-on-shoes.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965, which is sitting on top of a pair of shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching from a sedentary writer&apos;s lifestyle to an active one feels great, whether or not you&apos;re wearing a backpack. Rucking will make you stronger, but you probably shouldn&apos;t do it daily unless you&apos;re already in shape and have decent core strength — and don&apos;t feel awkward wearing a military pack in the suburbs or on city streets.</p><p>Otherwise, most people should take care not to have false expectations, or to hurt themselves by overtraining. Rucking once or twice a week is more realistic to start, and if you&apos;re using heavier weights, you probably should only be walking 2,000 to 5,000 steps at first, not 10,000. You&apos;ll want to walk longer and rucksack-free on other days to sustain losing weight.</p>
<h2 id="rucking-isn-apos-t-some-miracle-workout-2">Rucking isn&apos;t some miracle workout</h2>
<p>If you search "rucking calories," you&apos;ll see Gemini and marketing sites claiming that rucking burns 2.5–3x the calories you burn while walking, saving you time. Nope. I have no idea where they came up with that multiplier.</p><p>I hiked the same 10-mile hike with 2,250 feet of elevation gain, once with no pack and once with 25 pounds of pack weight. My first hike burned 1,081 calories (according to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>) with a 120 bpm HR average, 161 bpm max, and 2:38:06 total hike time; my second hike burned 1,541 calories with a 131 bpm HR average, 183 bpm max, and 2:57:10 hike time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yzytha8UrUsXciHnVifR4g" name="rucking-hike-calorie-comparison.jpg" alt="Two Garmin Connect app screenshots showing two near-identical hikes by the author, comparing their burned calories when hiking with or without a rucksack" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzytha8UrUsXciHnVifR4g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The left workout was weight-free; the gap might have been even closer, but I skipped a short out-and-back on that hike. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why did I burn more calories? Carrying more weight required slightly more cardiovascular effort on flat ground, steep hills strained my heart more than they normally would, and the same distance took slightly longer to finish. Still, I only burned 42.5% more calories, not 200% more.</p><p>No doubt I&apos;d burn even more calories with more weight, right? But only because it would stretch the hike longer; unless you&apos;re climbing tons of hills, the gap won&apos;t be that great, and more weight will just injure you. When I checked this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-fitness-requirements/rucking-calories-burned">article from a Navy Seal about rucking</a>, he had a similar, reasonable estimate to my findings: a "40%-50%" caloric boost from a 50-pound pack for military folk better trained for extra weight.</p><p>So if you&apos;re only walking or rucking for 30 minutes, you might jump from 200 to 340 calories — not insignificant, but not a paradigm shift either.</p>
<h2 id="rucking-is-only-apos-safe-apos-if-you-apos-re-careful-and-patient-2">Rucking is only &apos;safe&apos; if you&apos;re careful and patient</h2>
<p>There&apos;s this common idea that rucking is "safe" while running will destroy your joints and lead to injury. I can&apos;t deny that running can cause short- and long-term issues if you&apos;re not careful. But wearing an extra 30–50 pounds of weight for daily walks would put as much strain and compression on your unprepared joints and soft tissue over time, even if it&apos;s "low-impact."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32191155/#:~:text=Results%20indicated%20significant%20increases%20in,load%20carriage;%20peak%20impact%20force.">NIH</a> found that ROTC cadets were at higher risk of bone stress injuries after a four-mile ruck "despite the cadets not feeling fatigued." Without proper core strength, the compressive strain on your spine from heavy weight can lead to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cospineandjoint.com/rucking-compressive-load-lumbar-spine/">long-term disc, muscular, and spinal issues</a>, even with a supportive rucksack. And get ready for blisters, plantar fasciitis, and knee pain if you overdo it.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying this <em>will</em> happen, especially if you build up your strength safely over time with a lighter pack. But if you&apos;re not in the best shape and using rucking as a cure-all to shave off weight, you&apos;re going to have problems. A simple test is to see whether you can do simple body-weight exercises like squats or lunges, with or without a rucksack, to see if your body is ready for even more strain.</p><p>If it isn&apos;t, try walking for a month first; you might be surprised at how many calories you burn from simple body weight. Then maybe you&apos;ll be ready to ruck.</p>
<h2 id="my-advice-before-you-ruck-2">My advice before you ruck</h2>
<p>I apologize for being a Debbie Downer in this column. I really do enjoy rucking when I find the time, and I&apos;m hoping that if I develop more core strength, I&apos;ll be able to justify buying a more official and supportive rucking pack and boost my weight load. </p><p>But I&apos;d make that purchase knowing that rucking is a sideshow for me. It&apos;s an exciting challenge that gives <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">long hikes</a> more of an impact, but I can&apos;t hike more than once or twice a month without neglecting other parts of my life. And with or without a rucksack, walking just isn&apos;t as <em>fun</em> as running for me. Yes, I&apos;m weird.</p><p>If you want to dive into rucking, here is my advice:</p>
<ul><li>Start with whatever backpack you have now, and use heavy objects like water bottles if you don't have gym plates; <strong>then</strong> buy the proper rucking pack.</li><li>See if you have the inclination and patience to enjoy long walks, with or without a rucking pack. I recommend audiobooks or podcasts.</li><li>Wear a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> to track your body's progress in adapting to heavier weights.</li><li>Don't irresponsibly weigh down your rucksack more than you can handle in the vain hope of seeing tripled caloric burn. </li></ul>
<p>Just...hike! Give yourself the challenge of rucking — and all the associated costs — once you&apos;ve graduated from the basics. Otherwise, that rucksack will just take up closet space and you&apos;ll be looking for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">weight-loss</a> or workout fad.</p>
