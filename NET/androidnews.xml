<p>Once upon a time, there was this thing called AI. It started as a bit of code that could amalgamate information from one source so it could be manipulated to do useful things. As it grew, people writing that sort of code realized that there was potential to do even more useful things with it so dedicated computers were designed and built to be programmed to crunch the code even faster. </p><p>Then, someone — call him Jeff — decided that everything needed more AI. Jeff might have been drunk or high that day. Jeff pitched his idea to the "right" person, and AI transformed from something useful into something stupid. And you can&apos;t get away from it.</p>
<p>I know I&apos;m biased. After all, I have to look at tech all day, every day to make my living because my lifelong dream of being a professional slacker isn&apos;t going to pay my bills. I also know that I&apos;m not alone and a lot of people are getting sick and tired of <em>AI this</em> and <em>AI that</em> every time they look at a screen.</p><p>I&apos;m also not some Luddite or an old man yelling at the clouds. At least not this time. There are some valid concerns about AI and how it&apos;s taken over every facet of our tech lives. Dammit, Jeff, this is all your fault.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:823px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.37%;"><img id="ynkGKdSaCuNYNXQsnEu5tM" name="ChatGPT.png" alt="ChatGPT is stupid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynkGKdSaCuNYNXQsnEu5tM.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="823" height="324" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI doing things like monitoring apps that use too much of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-standby-battery-life-improvement-discussed">phone&apos;s battery</a> is great. AI that makes it easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">fix a picture</a> you took so that Grandpa looks awake or one of the kids isn&apos;t digging in the mud is fine and convenient. AI trying to actively teach you something could be good... but it&apos;s not.</p><p>That&apos;s because AI isn&apos;t intelligent (regardless of the label on the tin) and can&apos;t really learn anything. AI, at every level, is just a computer program that spits out the information it was programmed to spit out. Google has given us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">plenty of proof</a> with the mess that is AI Search (and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/">admits it</a>), and anyone who asks ChatGPT about drying towels knows zero critical thinking is involved. Is cramming it into every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new phone</a> or laptop really such a good idea?</p>
<p>It&apos;s comical in a way, and laughing at the dumb shit a company worth billions is willing to spit out is fun. Those programming uber-nerd types make the same mistakes we do because they are people; humans aren&apos;t perfect. But those errors aren&apos;t the problem.</p><p>Those arise when the errors sound plausible and correct enough that we believe them. AI leans heavily on <del>plagiarizing</del> copying things someone else has already said. Since people aren&apos;t perfect and can make mistakes, sometimes AI is going to be wrong, but it <em>sounds</em> like it&apos;s right. Unless we can fact-check everything some conversational AI bot tells us, we aren&apos;t going to know. </p><p>Do you want to take the time to fact-check everything <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">Microsoft CoPilot</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> tells you? Nope. Neither do I. If I&apos;m doing that, I could skip the bot and look it up myself. Relying on a bot that may or may not be right is lazy, and companies want us to do more of it.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t get me started on people who purposefully use AI to spread bad information. Every time some politician or stupid "action group" uses AI to make an image where people have 11 fingers across three arms and try to pass it off as proof of something, a kitten dies. Those are bad, evil people, and AI helps them become badder and more evil.</p>

<p>Unless you are willing to throw away everything you own that has a screen, you will be inundated by stupid AI. Eventually, AI should get better, but nobody is going to slow down and wait for it. Doing the right things isn&apos;t as profitable as telling us how AI will "disrupt" some sectors, and company X is going to be at the forefront. AI is a tech buzzword that isn&apos;t going away anytime soon.</p><p>You have all the tools to combat the insanity; you only have to use them. Think critically. Know that there is a high likelihood that anything AI tells you is wrong. Know that the Facebook group your uncle is in will be more than willing to spread doctored AI-generated images. Know that now, more than ever, much of what you see is a lie, and you&apos;ll quickly learn how to sort fact from fiction.</p>
<p>It&apos;s not up to us to fix this mess. I hope the companies who have pushed this at us are willing to do it, but we can only depend on them to do the profitable thing.</p><p>In the meantime feel free to think less of every tech company willing to be so bad at it.</p>

But beyond music streaming, Gabb is positioning itself as a safe space for kids to gradually transition into the world of technology and explore content in today&apos;s digital age.</p>
<h2 id="how-gabb-is-building-a-safe-tech-ecosystem-for-kids-2">How Gabb is building a safe tech ecosystem for kids</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FYPbYKw8wz6uBae7Za7BX9" name="Gabb-Phone-Z2-Kids-Phone-lifestyle-03.jpg" alt="Gabb Phone Z2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYPbYKw8wz6uBae7Za7BX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gabb, founded in 2018, has been making internet-free phones for kids ages 5 and 13. The company says it has taken a leadership role in providing research and education and developing solutions that empower parents with the tools to keep their children safe. It creates devices and apps that consider the age factor and the &apos;coolness&apos; aspect of the gadgets it creates.</p><p>"While still protecting (kids) from gaming addictions, dangers of predators, bullies, exposure to explicit language or inappropriate language and images," Brandon Jeppson, Gabb&apos;s director of marketing, told me in an email.</p><p>Regarding smartphones, the brand&apos;s latest Gabb phone and Gabb Phone 3 Pro have no internet connectivity, but they do provide the essential apps needed for each stage of development from grade school through high school. For instance, Gabb&apos;s teen-friendly phone is compatible with third-party apps like Kahoot, Duolingo, Gabb Maps, etc., which parents can enable if they feel their teens are ready.</p><p>These phones also come equipped with kid-safe messaging through Gabb Messenger, which constantly monitors texts and notifies parents if their kids are exposed to inappropriate content, opening up necessary conversations in families. Parents can also request that the company add certain apps that they feel are necessary in school or in public settings.</p><p>"Unlike other tech solutions, Gabb has kids as our first thought, not as an afterthought," Jeppson added.</p>

<p>After delving into music, Gabb highlights how parents wanted a platform that stages safe music options with no explicit content that their kids may accidentally encounter, so the company created a Gabb Music Plus subscription.</p><p>"Gabb Music doesn&apos;t just bleep out lyrics; instead, every explicit song and innuendo has been filtered out entirely using industry-leading tools and proprietary technology," said Gabb CEO Nate Randle.</p><p>The result is a curated music library that the whole family can listen to. Kids can search for songs and artists, create their own playlists, and download them on the go, much like on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a> like Spotify or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>.</p><p>Gabb&apos;s watches offer benefits similar to those of its phones. The latest Gabb Watch 3 allows calling and texting pre-approved contacts, ensuring kids stay connected with their families. These wearables also have an inbuilt GPS tracking system and an SOS button that provides an added layer of security when kids are away from home.</p>

<p>If you handed a toddler a smartphone today, you’d be surprised how they’d probably unlock your phone and start launching apps that interest them—which could lead them into a path of screen addictions when they’re supposed to be learning life skills.</p><p>Parents are constantly debating the right age to give their children a phone due to the increased psychological risks. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sapienlabs.org/whats_new/study-out-from-sapien-labs-links-age-of-first-smartphone-to-mental-wellbeing/">global study</a> of nearly 28,000 young adults showed a strong correlation between the age children receive their first smartphone and their mental health. It states, "the later the age at which these young adults first got a phone or tablet that they could carry with them in childhood, the better their mental well-being."</p><p>In today&apos;s vastly connected world, with access to smartphones and the internet, teens are bound to stumble upon inappropriate content and be subject to bullying, which, in turn, impacts their self-worth and ability to relate to others in a positive way. While most social media apps have age restrictions, bypassing those walls and getting through is equally easy.</p><p>Another study <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/132/5/958/31699/Children-Adolescents-and-the-Media?autologincheck=redirected">highlights</a> how 8 to 10-year-olds spend almost eight hours a day with various media, and older children and teenagers spend around 11 hours with media, leaving them susceptible to unwanted content or even social media predators.</p><p>That&apos;s where companies like Gabb come in, providing essential tools for parental control and age-appropriate functionality. Gabb says it tries to create an environment for kids to safely switch to other devices when they are adults while striving to remain relevant in today&apos;s AI-powered world. </p><p>That said, Gabb isn&apos;t the only company making kids-safe tech. Recently, Google announced the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>, a kids-only smartwatch that aims to promote a more healthy and active lifestyle. The wearable is not all about step-tracking— it also comes with "games" and other ways to get kids into the habit of staying active. The Ace LTE also offers calling, messaging, and location sharing.</p><p>"We believe the new appearance of other competitors is a validation of the growing interest in our mission to empower parents and kids to connect safely in a digital world," Jeppson added.</p><p>Despite other entrants into the market, Gabb feels that it has had a substantial head start on the competition and has established a loyal, growing customer base. </p><p>"We also continue to see a strong response from parents to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gabb.com/blog/tech-in-steps/">Tech in Steps</a> (aligning products with developmental stages) and the kid-first approach to helping kids and teens safely connect to family and friends."</p>

<ul><li>Many users have reported problems with the Meta Quest Guardian Boundary making them float or being tilted.</li><li>Normal methods of resetting the boundary don't always fix the problem, and it happens while sitting and standing in both roomscale and stationary boundaries.</li><li>The problem is caused by lying down mode, which was introduced in Meta Quest update v64 in April 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over the past month or so, I&apos;ve been struggling with weird problems with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>&apos;s guardian boundary. I&apos;d find myself floating above the floor in many Quest games, even though my height was set correctly, and I recently retraced my Guardian boundary. Even resetting the boundary wouldn&apos;t help.</p><p>I also found that my floor would tilt at an uncomfortable angle when I reset my guardian boundary by holding down the Oculus or Meta button on the right controller. My son reported many of the same issues on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-64gb-vs-oculus-quest-2-256gb">Meta Quest 2</a></p><p>Thankfully, I found a fix! Turns out, the lying-down mode introduced in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">Meta Quest update V64</a> in April is the culprit. Fixing the problem requires turning off lying-down mode. While that&apos;s annoying for folks who enjoy the feature, it&apos;s at least nice to be able to fix it in a quick way. Here&apos;s how to do that:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Click the <strong>Meta or Oculus button </strong>on your right controller to bring up the universal menu bar.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Open up the <strong>quick settings panel</strong> by clicking on the clock.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Click the <strong>Settings</strong> button on the top right.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Go into <strong>Experimental </strong>features by tapping the tile.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Click on the slider next to <strong>use apps while lying down</strong> to turn the feature off.</p>

<p>Once that&apos;s done, it&apos;s best to reset your Guardian Boundary settings to get a fresh start and ensure everything is good to go. To do that, head back into the <strong>settings </strong>menu, then click <strong>Physical Space</strong>, then tap on the <strong>clear</strong> button next to the <strong>clear boundary history</strong> option.</p><p>Once that&apos;s done, you&apos;ll need to redraw your Guardian Boundary by following the on-screen steps. If you want to re-set up your room for mixed reality, open <strong>settings </strong>on your Meta Quest 3, tap <strong>Physical Space</strong>, then launch the <strong>setup tool </strong>found under the <strong>spaces tab</strong>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Most of my gaming is done on my Windows rig or the PlayStation 5, and while I tend to play a few casual titles on my phone, they don&apos;t need a controller. I didn&apos;t bother with mobile controllers up to this point, but using the Steam Deck reinvigorated my interest in handhelds (I&apos;m obsessed with Balatro), and I wanted to see what Android has to offer.</p><p>It didn&apos;t take long to realize that Android has a lot of amazing games, so I needed to get my hands on a mobile controller. I have a dozen PS5 and Xbox controllers, but I wanted something designed to be used with a phone, and my search led to GameSir, specifically the G8 Galileo.</p><p>The G8 Galileo is GameSir&apos;s latest mobile controller, and it has a lot of unique features. It has full-size triggers and buttons, and it is just as comfortable to use as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/scuf-reflex-pro-ps5-controller-review">Scuf Reflex Pro</a>, my preferred PS5 controller. It has an extensible design that can easily slot in a variety of phones, and the USB-C port pivots, making it incredibly convenient to attach a phone to the controller.</p><p>If you&apos;ve tried out a mobile controller but weren&apos;t satisfied with the sizing or build quality, you should take a look at the G8 Galileo.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VfvWCtGpLkXye2XKt64BvH" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-4.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo thumbsticks have hall effect triggers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VfvWCtGpLkXye2XKt64BvH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>GameSir unveiled the G8 Galileo in November 2023, and the mobile controller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG">costs just $79 on Amazon</a>. You can also buy it for the same $79 retail price <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-g8-galileo">via GameSir&apos;s website</a>, and while you don&apos;t get a carrying case with the package — unlike other GameSir products — you can buy a bundle by shelling out an additional $10.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-galileo-design-and-features"><span>GameSir G8 Galileo: Design and features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3DWEkFt2pzT4RJzxUagfyM" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-13.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo next to Scuf Reflex Pro and Instinct controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DWEkFt2pzT4RJzxUagfyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The G8 Galileo is larger than other mobile controllers, and this is a good thing. Using it against GameSir&apos;s X3 controller, the difference is immediately noticeable — the full-size D-pad, triggers, and buttons make it feel closer to using an Xbox controller, and that goes a long way while gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pkqr9ugTV4Yb7sQpLDBc4L" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-16.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo with Pixel 8 Pro next to X3 controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pkqr9ugTV4Yb7sQpLDBc4L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fit and finish is outstanding; the G8 Galileo feels much better in-hand than the X3, and the contoured design at the back with the textured finish makes it incredibly comfortable to hold and use. That said, it is on the heavier side at 251g, and when you add the weight of a phone, you&apos;re going to notice the heft, particularly during marathon gaming sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Eivk88r5jZGw3zBbfsn9PK" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-15.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo with Pixel 8 Pro docked to the controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eivk88r5jZGw3zBbfsn9PK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The G8 Galileo is available in a grey color scheme, and it looks decent enough in its own right. The faceplate is attached magnetically to the controller, and is easily detachable. But seeing as how the brand doesn&apos;t sell faceplate designs (yet), you don&apos;t get much in the way of customization. What you do get is a choice of three thumbsticks — short, tall, and dome — and you can easily switch these out as needed.</p>

<p>Slotting in a phone is pretty straightforward; the G8 Galileo has an extensible design with the left side stretching outward, and while GameSir says the controller can accommodate phones with large camera modules, that isn&apos;t the case. Most 2024 phones had an issue with the fit; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> jutted out as there just wasn&apos;t enough clearance for their camera housings.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, and the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-reviewhttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> slotted into the G8 Galileo without any issues, so I used the controller with these phones. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> would have been an ideal choice, but as its USB-C port isn&apos;t centered, it just looked awkward when attached to the controller.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bCuwKz5kqH5YFuH3xJNazJ" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-18.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo side view showing iPhone 15 Pro Max fitting with case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCuwKz5kqH5YFuH3xJNazJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cases aren&apos;t a problem, as long as they&apos;re not rugged; I use a case with my Pixel 8 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and there was enough clearance to fit both phones comfortably. My favorite feature is the pivoting USB-C port; it just allows you to slot in a phone with a minimum of hassle, and there&apos;s no worry of the port snagging on a phone when you take it out.</p>

<p>While there&apos;s clearly a lot to like on the design side of things, the G8 Galileo isn&apos;t geared for portability. The mobile controller is just too big, and unlike other GameSir controllers, you don&apos;t get a hard shell carrying case — that obviously hinders its usability outside the house.</p>

<p>The best thing about the G8 Galileo is that it is just like an Xbox controller in daily use, and that gives it a distinct edge. Most mobile controllers I used to this point had smaller buttons and triggers, and that gets annoying really fast. Thankfully, that just isn&apos;t an issue with the G8 Galileo, and it is just as comfortable as a regular controller.</p>

<p>The buttons have great tactility and feedback, and the triggers have a good range of motion. The textured back design makes holding and using the controller easier, and even though it gets heavy once you add a phone, it isn&apos;t too uncomfortable even with extended gaming sessions.</p>

<p>What I also like is that it has paddles at the back, and they&apos;re easily configurable; you don&apos;t need to do fiddle with the software. There&apos;s no drift issues with the hall effect thumbsticks, and even with extended use, they held up just fine — there are no problems in this area. If the bundled thumbsticks aren&apos;t to your liking, you get different-sized options in the package, and it&apos;s easy to switch them out.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a 3.5mm jack on the controller as well, and it allows you to easily plug in IEMs. Another useful addition is pass-through charging; you can charge your phone by plugging in the charger to the USB-C port located on the side of the G8 Galileo.</p>

<p>The G8 Galileo is terrific in daily use; it automatically works in titles that can be played with a controller, and there&apos;s no latency whatsoever — as you&apos;d imagine. The biggest differentiator is the larger size, and it allows the controller to be comfortable even after extended gaming sessions. In fact, it&apos;s for this reason that I ended up playing a lot more than I thought I would via my phone.</p><p>If you prefer cloud gaming, the G8 Galileo integrates with GeForce Now and Amazon Luna. I tested it with Steam Link, and there were no problems.</p>

<p>The Backbone One is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">best mobile controllers</a> around. It is on the smaller side and is easier to take on the road, but you miss out on full-size buttons, and there are no paddles on the back. And at $99, it isn&apos;t as affordable as the G8 Galileo.</p><p>I use Scuf&apos;s controllers extensively, and the brand just rolled out its first mobile controller, dubbed Nomad. It connects over Bluetooth 5.0 and is designed to be used with iPhones, and like the G8 Galileo, it has full-size triggers and thumbsticks. Coming in at $99, it is costlier, but if it&apos;s anything like the Reflex or Instinct controllers, it should be fabulous.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a mobile controller with great build quality</li><li>You need a controller that's extremely comfortable</li><li>You need a plug-and-play device that doesn't need any tinkering</li><li>You need hall effect thumbsticks</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a portable mobile controller</li><li>You have a phone with an oversized camera island</li></ul>
<p>As I said at the beginning, I haven&apos;t paid much attention to this category in the past, but GameSir&apos;s G8 Galileo delivers everything I need in a mobile controller. The size is just right; it is large enough to get a comfortable grip, and the buttons and thumbsticks are terrific.</p><p>Passthrough charging and the addition of a 3.5mm port make it just that little more versatile, and I like the pivoting USB-C connector — I paired the controller with a lot of phones, and I wasn&apos;t worried about the port damaging any device. The only quibble is that it doesn&apos;t work with phones that have sizeable cameras, and that&apos;s most high-end phones these days. That said, it wasn&apos;t an issue with the Pixel 8 Pro or the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>I didn&apos;t see any issues with the build quality either in the six months I used the G8 Galileo, and while it isn&apos;t as easily portable as GameSir&apos;s other products, it is one of the best mobile controllers around.</p>

<hr>
<p>One thing that became clear at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O</a> is that Google wants to make AI one of Android&apos;s main focuses. There are a handful of Android features that are already available on existing phones with cloud processing, and more are coming with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. However, on-device AI processing is the end goal, and Gemini Nano is the key. Moving crucial AI processes on-device can improve speed and security, among other benefits. That&apos;s why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> and the entire Samsung Galaxy S24 shipped with at least a few on-device AI features. </p><p>Google caused a stir when it explained that the Pixel 8 would not get Gemini Nano, the company&apos;s smallest AI model designed for mobile use. At the time, it said that there were "hardware limitations" that prevented the Pixel 8 from running Gemini Nano well. Since both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and Pixel 8 Pro are powered by the Tensor G3 system-on-a-chip, that may have been perplexing to some. It also came on the heels of Google touting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-8-pro-seven-android-os-updates-game-changer">seven-year software update promise</a> for the Pixel 8 series. </p><p>Eventually, Google reversed course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">saying in March</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini Nano</a> would come to the Pixel 8 as an opt-in feature. That&apos;s now right around the corner as Google prepares the June update for Pixels. This update could come as soon as next week and will bring Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a. However, ahead of this move, Google is updating Android AICore to add a toggle specifically for generative AI features on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gemini Nano is about to roll out to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a, as promised! One Pixel 8 user informed me today that they now have an "enable on-device GenAI Features" toggle under Settings > System > Developer options > AICore Settings. This toggle "enable[s] GenAI features… pic.twitter.com/PE3RuqIX45<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1795903720686772393">May 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Originally, the AICore settings page for Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a had an option called <strong>Enable AICore Persistent</strong>, which allows "AICore to carve out memory and run persistently." This has been replaced by a new toggle, as one user running <strong>version 0.release.pixel8.636144055 of AICore</strong> told Mishaal Rahman. The updated toggle is <strong>Enable on-device GenAI Features</strong>, and will "enable GenAI features that will run through AICore, using Gemini."</p><p>The toggle is disabled by default, and this aligns with Google&apos;s prior comments that Gemini Nano would come to the remaining Pixel 8 devices as an optional setting. Although this AICore setting doesn&apos;t specifically mention Gemini Nano, it&apos;s a huge sign that the model is being readied for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a, as promised. Right now, it isn&apos;t clear whether the <strong>Enable on-device GenAI Features</strong> toggle is showing up for Pixel 8a users as well or if it&apos;s limited to the Pixel 8 for now. </p><p>While it&apos;s great that Google seems to have figured out how to support Gemini Nano throughout the entire Pixel 8 series, the rocky road that led us here might foreshadow more troubles as smartphones age. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="cm64GCZLiWFzRYadf3YodH" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-04.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a in the Bay blue colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cm64GCZLiWFzRYadf3YodH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google didn&apos;t specifically elaborate on what "hardware limitation" prevented the Pixel 8 from running Gemini Nano, but it isn&apos;t hard to figure out the issue. Both the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro use the Tensor G3 SoC for processing, and the main hardware difference is the amount of RAM. The Pixel 8 Pro has 12GB of RAM, while the regular Pixel 8 (and later the budget Pixel 8a) only has 8GB. Since artificial intelligence features demand a lot of memory, this is likely the reason Google was wary of giving Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8. </p><p>However, the base-model Galaxy S24 also has 8GB of RAM, and it still has on-device AI features. One of those is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a> in Google Messages, which uses the Galaxy S24&apos;s on-device compute. Of course, the Galaxy S24 uses a different SoC, but it&apos;s still an example of a base-model flagship being able to make use of the latest AI features. Now that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a are getting Gemini Nano, it&apos;ll make those phones more equivalent to the Pixel 8 Pro in AI performance. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XEqwWyruhp9tJEkwMXXZnD" name="Google-Pixel-8-magic-editor.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 hands on with AI features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XEqwWyruhp9tJEkwMXXZnD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s difficult to completely fault Google for the delay in bringing Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8. If the phone wasn&apos;t able to use Gemini Nano without inhibiting performance, letting these devices have it anyway would create a worse experience. Giving users the choice of whether to use Gemini Nano or not following the June update is the best of both scenarios. </p><p>However, the drawn-out process of bringing Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8 once again brings up the central question of this year&apos;s launch: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">why would Google promise seven years of updates?</a> Gemini Nano is the smallest Gemini model ever created, and it&apos;ll likely <em>remain</em> the smallest Gemini model forever. AI models are becoming bigger — not smaller — and it&apos;s almost a certainty that the next iteration of Gemini Nano will be larger. If the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a could barely run Gemini Nano, the hopes of these devices running newer AI models and gaining future on-device features seem slim.</p><p>That&apos;s the problem with the seven-year promise for software updates, especially on the Pixel 8a and Pixel 8. The viability of using a phone for seven years and still getting a great experience the entire way is still pretty unproven on Android. You could make the case that the Pixel 8 didn&apos;t get the entire experience in year one, so that doesn&apos;t bode well for what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-android-21-look-like-on-pixel-8">year seven might look like</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Head of Search, Liz Reid, spoke about the problems that went wrong with the AI Overviews.</li><li>Reid stated that the AI bot ended up taking "nonsensical" and "satirical" queries a little too seriously, and ended up pulling an internet troll's answer to fill the void.</li><li>Moving forward, Reid says Google will implement a limit on the amount of "user-generated" content its AI takes and detection systems for "nonsensical" questions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following a truly odd experience with Google&apos;s AI Overview results last week, the company&apos;s Head of Search, Liz Reid, is trying to clear the air.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/">Keyword post</a>, Reid touched on the strange and down-right false answers that Google&apos;s AI-powered Search results provided users. Reid stated that while some of the odd responses users posted on social media were false screenshots, others truly occurred. The answers people received were attributed to "queries that people don’t commonly do" — and therein lay the problem.</p><p>It&apos;s because of this problem that Google is going back into the kitchen and taking a hard look at how its AI interprets "nonsensical" and "satirical" queries.</p><p>Reid used one example that popped up everywhere: "How many rocks should I eat?" While no one in their right mind would do such a thing, the AI doesn&apos;t really know that. It&apos;s simply fulfilling a query. The company&apos;s Search lead stated that since there isn&apos;t much data on the internet to "seriously contemplate" such a question, it&apos;s turned into an "information gap."</p><p>So, what happened is that the AI did its best to answer the question and ended up pulling an internet troll&apos;s answer to an outrageous question. Reid added that the AI also pulled sarcastic information from forum sites (think Reddit) about using glue to stick cheese on a pizza.</p><p>Google is working on fixing its AI Overviews on a broad scale rather than condensing the issues down to a singular, random query. Reid informs that the company has started building better detection systems for those nonsensical queries and "limited the inclusion of satire and humor content." Another parameter includes a limit on how much "user-generated" content the AI takes into consideration.</p><p>For health and important news stories, Google remains adamant about not displaying AI Overviews to preserve the facts and authenticity of available information.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:107.13%;"><img id="cj2Nhi387j8P3ovzyjor9a" name="shitposting.png" alt="A social media screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cj2Nhi387j8P3ovzyjor9a.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1157" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Search&apos;s AI pulls information from all across the internet, which can be a problem when there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">trolls and shitposters around</a>. Hopefully, with the company reiterating its encouragement of user feedback, these problems will slowly begin to reduce. We may not be at a point where it&apos;s completely zero but, hopefully, more facts start going around than fiction.</p><p>Moreover, this problem with AI Overviews came a couple of weeks after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">rolled them out to everyone</a>. During I/O 2024, Google stated that its overviews would arrive to U.S. folks on May 14, alongside some query adjustment settings. Typically, these overviews are a quick snippet, providing a user with the most important bits of information in a bite-sized piece.</p><p>Additionally, these AI Overviews provide links so users can do a little fact-checking to verify the bot&apos;s answer.</p>

<p>Last April, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/is-there-anything-chromebook-cant-do">I wrote a piece</a> about the negative stigma that still surrounds the idea of someone using a Chromebook. By and large, that stigma remains, but I think that there&apos;s never been a better time to buy a Chromebook over a Windows PC.</p><p>If you ask around here at Android Central, there&apos;s a pretty good chance you&apos;ll find that I might just be the most pessimistic member of the team. While I love and have an affinity for various devices, my mind mostly defaults to the negatives. This includes Chromebooks and ChromeOS, so when our accessories editor, Namerah, asked for my opinion about an article she was working on about switching to Windows, my initial impression was one of agreement. </p><p>However, after letting my thoughts stew and marinate for a little bit longer, I came to a surprising and different conclusion. In her piece, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/why-im-switching-from-chromebook-to-surface-tablet">she explains</a> why she&apos;s giving up on Chromebooks and will instead be picking up a Surface for her next computer. There was a time when I would have said, "Hell yeah, I can definitely get behind that." However, the days of scoffing at the idea of using a Chromebook over a Windows laptop or MacBook are gone, at least in most regards.</p><p>Namerah&apos;s piece demonstrates how the stigma around Chromebooks is still very much alive. That&apos;s not to say her experience using one isn&apos;t valid—it very much is—as we all have our preferences, and not everyone will enjoy using a Chromebook as much as a Windows PC. However, Chromebooks are much more capable machines than many people think they are.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6wAi4bn9mAvBUiFMVecLn5" name="surface-go-3-wc.jpg" alt="Aluminum lid on the Microsoft Surface Go 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wAi4bn9mAvBUiFMVecLn5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One example pointed out in the piece is trying to resize "an image to a specific size or sharing files to and from a ChromeOS tablet." For the first one, I would argue that it&apos;s actually a bit easier to accomplish, as there are two different ways to go about resizing an image.</p>
<p>When using the native Gallery app, there&apos;s a button at the top, and then you can either manually resize it or choose one of the presets at the bottom. You can also open the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, view your "On Device" images, click the Edit button, and make changes from there. Not to mention, Google continues to add other editing options, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> with ChromeOS 125.</p><p>As for sharing files between devices, this is something I&apos;ve complained forever about, as nothing seemed to work as seamlessly as Apple&apos;s AirDrop. Although it&apos;s still not <em>quite</em> as smooth as it should be, Google&apos;s continued improvements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> have paid dividends. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="66Nuyoq3cMjPTiyQQBzGp7" name="phone-hub-chromebook-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4.jpg" alt="Phone Hub open on Chromebook with Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/66Nuyoq3cMjPTiyQQBzGp7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-phone-hub-on-chromebooks">Phone Hub</a>, which also works pretty well, even if it is limited to only showing you a few recent photos and files. If anything, I&apos;d like for Google to make it so that I can view all of the files and photos on my phone, not just a handful of the most recent ones.</p><p>The piece goes on to talk about problems with various peripherals not working with Chromebooks. This isn&apos;t something I&apos;ve experienced frequently, and the only times I&apos;ve personally run into problems have been when using a gaming mouse. The majority of the time, it&apos;s a "connect and go" situation, even if the peripheral doesn&apos;t explicitly have the "Works with Chromebook" stamp. I&apos;ve even managed to get a spare Apple Magic Trackpad paired with a Chromebook, and it works pretty darn well.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say there isn&apos;t room for improvement, but it&apos;s also something that the ChromeOS team is working on. Back with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-m123-april-update">ChromeOS 123</a>, added the ability to customize what your mouse buttons do, provided that you&apos;re using a mouse with more than two buttons. It also added a flag to enable keyboard shortcut customization before it was enabled by default with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chrome-os-m124-may-update-changes">ChromeOS 124</a>. </p><p>Ultimately, Namerah explains how the Surface Go 3 "checks all the boxes" as it "can be used as a tablet, too, and because it runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-11">Windows 11</a>, you can use it like any other computer." This was the part that really caught my attention, simply because I find Windows on a tablet to be downright awful.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve learned this more and more as I&apos;ve gone deeper into gaming handhelds such as the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, MSI Claw, and others. Trying to do anything outside of the OEM&apos;s dashboard without a mouse and keyboard is just asking for punishment. That&apos;s why I have an arsenal of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-keyboards-android-tablets">foldable Bluetooth keyboards</a> with built-in trackpads—well, that and my continued love of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. </p><p>Again, I&apos;m not saying that Namerah is wrong or that I&apos;m right. What I <em>am</em> saying is that ChromeOS is much more capable now than it was even six months ago. The proof is in the pudding, as evidenced by the release of ChromeOS 125 and the announcement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">six new Chromebook models</a>.</p><p>At the end of last year, I wrote about the things that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-chromeos-wishlist-2024">I hoped to see from ChromeOS and Chromebooks</a> over the course of 2024. With one fell swoop, Google and its hardware partners checked off two of the four boxes. ChromeOS 125 brought with it Gemini integration, something that I&apos;d argue should have been there from the start. Meanwhile, ASUS introduced a new ChromeOS tablet, and it seems we could be in store for a few more options.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I don&apos;t expect to go 4/4 with my predictions. Doing so would require Google to resurrect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Pixelbook successor</a> and for a Chromebook to be released with a dedicated GPU along with more than 128GB of storage. I don&apos;t see either of those things happening, but hey, a guy can dream.</p><p>If you&apos;re deciding between a Chromebook and a Windows device, I&apos;d recommend thinking twice. Sure, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Copilot Plus</a> features seem cool, but if you look a bit deeper, Microsoft is morphing Windows into the ultimate platter of ads.</p><p>Recently, Microsoft has been testing out different ways to serve users more ads, but I&apos;m not just talking about hounding you to set Edge as the default browser. I mean actual ads from companies other than Microsoft that show up in the Start Menu or Settings app. As pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/the-best-way-to-remove-ads-from-the-windows-11-start-menu-is-now-on-sale">Sean Endicott of Windows Central</a>, "The fact that Microsoft won&apos;t even allow people to pay to remove ads suggests the company makes more money off promotions than people would be willing to pay."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hd3VyrM42ivVVbFLeLpjBE" name="windows-start-menu-ads-wc.jpg" alt="Windows 11's Start menu will soon feature more ads, as will the Settings app on your PC." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hd3VyrM42ivVVbFLeLpjBE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sean Endicott / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s reached a breaking point where people are creating user-friendly tools to alter the registry in an effort to get rid of ads. It&apos;s also the same reason why I&apos;ve been attempting to become more familiar with Linux, as the writing is on the wall for the day when I have to watch a 30-second ad just to unlock my desktop Windows PC.</p><p>For the time being, Microsoft is the only one doing anything like this with its operating system. Google and Apple shove "ads" in your face, but they are the ones that we&apos;ve basically ignored for years and aren&apos;t being blatantly added to things like the launcher. </p><p>If anything, I&apos;d argue that now&apos;s actually the perfect time to switch <em>to</em> ChromeOS, especially as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">more Chromebook Plus devices hit the market</a>. There are still kinks to work out, but it&apos;s clear that Google is committed to the platform. How often can we say such a thing about something that Google offers? </p>

<ul><li>An APK deep dive showed that Netflix could roll out an HDR streaming toggle for users on Android.</li><li>The toggle would let users swap between HDR streaming or SDR if they choose, however, this is still experimental.</li><li>HDR has been known to demand more power from a phone, draining its battery quicker and taking up more bandwidth.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There are whispers that Netflix might have started developing an HDR toggle for its streaming services on Android, and it could be a good thing.</p><p>As spotted during an APK deep dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-hdr-toggle-android-app-apk-teardown-3447290/">Android Authority</a>, beta 3.5 based on the latest 8.117 version of the Netflix app shows signs of an HDR toggle. A few strings in the app&apos;s code state "Android Allow SDR/HDR Streaming Selection sic." Another string in the code mentions a "switch button" so users can quickly hop between HDR streaming or the lower SDR option.</p><p>HDR (High Dynamic Range) bolsters a streamed video by giving the user brighter colors, increasing its overall quality. The other option, SDR, stands for "Standard" dynamic range, which offers a "lower" quality compared to the former. Google offers HDR streaming on YouTube and explains as much on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272?hl=en#:~:text=HDR%20lets%20you%20show%20more,265%20(HEVC)%20video%20codec.">support page</a>.</p><p>The publication also notes that HDR can be quite consuming for devices that support it because of its hunger for power. HDR can drain a device&apos;s battery much faster due to its demands while also consuming more data. The post cites an interview between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/dolby/151391-hdr-saviour-streaming/">Pocket-Lint and a Dolby executive</a> who stated that HDR consumes "5% to 10% more data" than SDR streaming.</p><p>The executive added that this number is "negligible," so it&apos;s not that big of a deal.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication reiterated a problem it noticed with the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s24-hdr-playback-test-3426195/">HDR playback</a> where it would dim the display, causing an unenjoyable experience.</p><p>For now, the existence of an HDR toggle for the app on Android is "experimental." Things can go either way, so we&apos;ll have to play it by ear from here on out.</p>

<p>While we wait for what comes next, Netflix detailed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">plans for 2024</a>, which, surprise (not really), includes another price hike. Earlier this year, the streaming platform seemingly saw the end-user as the catalyst behind its ongoing investments. While the company said that a reason behind a price hike could deal with "inflation or higher data center costs," its plans for entertainment were also a factor.</p><p>Even if users don&apos;t actively engage or care about certain pieces of entertainment, a price hike will still hit, regardless.</p>

<ul><li>Threads has pushed a change to its desktop UI that wastes a lot of space in the app's view.</li><li>The feed is still centered, however, users can only change the type of feed in a drop-down menu nestled above it.</li><li>The remainder of Threads' UI is thrown off to the left side, mirroring the likes of Instagram on computers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Threads has pushed an update to its user interface on the desktop and is giving us Instagram vibes.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich spotted the change earlier this morning (May 31) and made note of the sheer Instagram callbacks. For one, Threads on PCs now looks like it&apos;s designed purely for the vertical screen, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>. Sutrich noted the increased amount of wasted space surrounding the Threads feed, which can be changed from "For You" to "Following" and more.</p><p>Users can quickly rediscover content they&apos;ve "liked" or "saved" through that drop-down menu.</p><p>The feed is still centered, however, those feed settings are now the only piece of UI remaining at the top in a drop-down menu. Other options, like Home, Search, Activity, and your profile are now off to the far left side vertically.</p><p>The new post button is nestled on the bottom right of the screen.</p><p>Threads has also implemented some slight color alterations, with the primary feed becoming a little lighter than the background in light and dark mode.</p>

<p>Instagram has looked like this for a while now on desktop, with its primary feed centered, stories on top, and other UI elements tossed to the left side. While Instagram&apos;s version offers a lot of space, it&apos;s taken down a bit due to its written-out feature names and a box of suggested profiles on the right.</p><p>The old Threads view was much more confined, featuring everything one would need in the center of their screen on a PC.</p><p>Additionally, there&apos;s a chance Threads is trying to appease <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> and other tablet UI devices with this change. How Instagram&apos;s desktop UI functions for such devices fits perfectly, so maybe we should&apos;ve seen this coming. Threads&apos; new UI for computers seems widely available now.</p><p>In other news, Threads rolled out a feature that allowed users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-allows-users-to-limit-quote-posts-on-the-app-and-web">limit who could quote</a> their posts on the platform earlier in May. After posting, the owner can select a few options: Anyone, Profiles you follow, and Mentioned Only. What&apos;s more, X (formerly Twitter) users will recognize this.</p><p>Instagram&apos;s head, Adam Mosseri, stated the change is designed to let users "restrict others who look to demean or troll them, a safe space to share thoughts..."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I see a lot of great Verizon deals, but they often involve so many eligibility requirements that it can be hard for folks to get the smartphone savings they want. Fortunately, the Big Three carrier has just launched a Samsung Galaxy S23 deal that lacks <em>most </em>of that pesky fine print: add a line with an eligible data plan and you&apos;ll score enough promo credits to make the phone 100% free. No kidding. </p><p>All of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon&apos;s current Unlimited plans</a> will get you the free phone, but if you choose the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, you could choose to get a FREE Amazon 65-inch Omni Series Fire TV instead. That&apos;s a $799.99 value, the only catch is that you&apos;ll have to pay full price for the phone to get the TV. </p>

<p>The compact <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> may be last year's flagship, but it's still a sweet Android phone, coming complete with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, a lovely 6.1-inch AMOLED display, and years of software support guaranteed. You even get to enjoy all of those fancy Galaxy AI features that the OEM has been talking about.  Buy the phone and add an eligible line to your Verizon service and you'll get $699.99 in promo credits over 36 months. That makes the S23 completely free. </p>
<p>That being said, if you don't mind paying for the phone, you can choose the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan and get a FREE 65-inch smart TV out of the deal, because why not? <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s23/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8b668dca-1628-4ee3-92cf-3feef5bc87ed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB: $699.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB: $699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Of course, if money isn&apos;t an object, you&apos;ll be better off going straight to the newer Samsung Galaxy S24 — but when you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-s23">Galaxy S23 vs S24</a>, you&apos;ll see that the two phones aren&apos;t actually <em>that </em>different. Sure, the Galaxy S23 has an older processor and a slightly smaller display, but you won&apos;t notice any real difference with day to day use. So if you&apos;re a Verizon user or you&apos;re looking to switch, why not take advantage of this offer and get one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released last year?  </p>
