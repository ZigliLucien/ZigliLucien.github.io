For a limited time, you can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-128gb-unlocked-ink-blue/6540584.p"><strong>up to $200 off on the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) from Best Buy</strong></a> when you have the retailer activate the phone to the carrier of your choice. Even if you connect it to your carrier later, you&apos;ll still get $100 off the price, which is already a 40% discount.</p><p>While the Moto G 5G is really nothing special, it&apos;s a great pick at this price for anyone in need of a cheap, basic smartphone. It boasts decent camera functionality, pretty good stereo speakers, slick Motorola gestures, and over a day&apos;s worth of battery life.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2023-review">Motorola Moto G 5G (2023)</a> normally comes in at a cheap sticker price, but this discount makes it even cheaper, dropping as low as $49.99 if you activate today. With its aesthetically pleasing design, decent cameras, and more than a full day of battery life, this deal is a no-brainer for those who want a no-frills smartphone.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this phone charges fairly slowly, and it doesn't include NFC. Still, dealing with some of its shortcomings might be easier at this extra-low price.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-128GB-MPCamera-163-94x74-98x8-39/dp/B0C2SWQBMB">Amazon - $149.99</a> | <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-5g-gen-2/p?skuId=894">Motorola - $149.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-128gb-unlocked-ink-blue/6540584.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a3070159-46d4-4fdb-adf9-23b269d8594a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>smartphone price point is a major selling point for you; you&apos;ve owned past Motorola phones and enjoyed them.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a phone with NFC capabilities; you&apos;re willing to spend a few hundred dollars more for a phone with more bells and whistles; slow charging speeds are a deterrent for you.</p><p>The Motorola Moto 5G has all the basics you would expect to find in a smartphone, despite being the 2023 version. Besides lacking NFC capabilities, having limited software updates, and taking quite a while to charge, the Moto 5G still offers excellent speakers, more than a day of battery per charge, and a decent camera.</p><p>While this phone didn&apos;t land a spot on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> list, the Moto G is super affordable and is a solid pick for anyone trying to get a phone at the lowest sticker price possible. Especially with the additional $100 or $200 off, it&apos;s not hard to justify some of the quirky design choices included with this smartphone.</p>

<p>Ozaif writes:</p><p><em><strong>I recently bought a Redmi Note 12 5G and I have gyroscope and accelerometer issues in games and other things. Is there a solution?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>This question from Ozaif is very similar to others we&apos;ve received, where something is happening that causes a new(ish) phone to not perform the way we think it should. It&apos;s a thing that can happen to any phone or electronic device, and it&apos;s a wonder that it doesn&apos;t happen more often.</p><p>For starters, don&apos;t get frustrated. At the risk of sounding like an apologist for any phone maker, when you manufacture and sell millions of products, some are going to have hardware faults. There&apos;s no way to test everything on every phone without driving the price even higher than it already is.</p>
<p>The good news is that companies usually resolve these issues quickly. You just need to know where to start. You might think you should contact the company that made your phone but that&apos;s not always the case.</p>
<h2 id="who-did-you-buy-it-from-2">Who did you buy it from?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:881px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="bVKWwrajQZTCksqxrC3dxG" name="best-buy-sign.jpg" alt="Best Buy store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bVKWwrajQZTCksqxrC3dxG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="881" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Best Buy)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can buy a new phone directly from the manufacturer, but it&apos;s also really common to buy through a third party. This could be from a carrier like AT&T or Orange, a retail partner like Best Buy or Walmart, or an online retailer like Amazon.</p><p>Where you bought your phone could make a difference here. For starters, different sales channels have different types of warranty. We all know about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Applecare and Samsung Care Plus</a>, but you&apos;re also able to buy extra protection from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/protect-amazon-tech-purchases-asurions-home-protection-plans">Asurion</a>. You might have seen this option when you bought a phone online or heard about it from a salesperson.</p>
<p>The warranty — which every phone has unless you&apos;re buying it in a country it wasn&apos;t intended to be sold in — is the first course of action if your phone is acting up. If you&apos;re unsure about who to contact for a warranty claim or if your warranty is still in effect, ask the place where you bought your phone, and they will help; they want you to be happy enough to buy your next phone from them, after all.</p><p>A special note here for people in North America who bought a phone through a carrier: you need to initiate any service or warranty claims through them because they&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones">special type of partner</a>. </p><p>A phone made by Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-att-phones">specifically for AT&T</a> (for example) is essentially an AT&T product. It was built by Samsung, and in the end, Samsung may be the one who fixes things, but it&apos;s still an AT&T product. Carrier phones in the U.S. and Canada are weird like that. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2033px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NRji8rSYBjVeYXgNQYLe3g" name="ATT-logo-building.jpg" alt="AT&T Store in NYC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NRji8rSYBjVeYXgNQYLe3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2033" height="1144" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re out of warranty and have no extended service contract, you have limited options. Some things, like a stuck button or malfunctioning camera, are fixable, but others — like a broken gyroscope — aren&apos;t. There&apos;s no way to isolate, decouple, and replace components like this that isn&apos;t going to cost less than buying a new phone.</p><p>Make sure you have an actual hardware issue. Something that happens in some apps but not in others is indicative of incompatible software and not "broken" hardware, so do a bit of sleuthing yourself and see if you can consistently cause the problem. One option is to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-run-diagnostics-on-your-pixel">diagnostic tool</a>, like the one found on Pixel phones.</p>
<p>If you can, try asking a local phone repair center to take a look at it and diagnose the issue. This might cost a few dollars, and you might not like what they find, but it&apos;s better than sending your phone off somewhere and being without it for a week or two.</p><p>It also gives you an idea of what&apos;s wrong, whether it&apos;s fixable, and what it might cost. A local shop can repair or replace a lot of parts on a phone and a trip to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-repair-partner-ubreakifix-now-asurion-tech-repair-and-solutions">uBreakiFix store</a> might be just what the doctor ordered. </p>
<p>The sad reality is that phones are disposable consumer electronics and aren&apos;t designed to be serviced and repaired. Once your phone is out of warranty or an extended service contract, you&apos;re simply expected to buy a new one when it stops working the way it should.</p><p>With phones seeing seven years of software support, this may have to change. Until then, your best bet is to consider an extended warranty.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Galaxy Ring leak claims to have spotted several model numbers for the product, indicative of several sizes Samsung plans to provide.</li><li>The discovery highlights the existence of eight model numbers, with speculation that a ninth could be available on launch.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring is rumored to feature American ring sizes ranging from 5 to 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak claims to shed light on the existence of several Galaxy Ring sizes for consumers later this year.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-ring/">GalaxyClub</a> (Dutch), Samsung&apos;s first smart ring could arrive in nine sizes as the device&apos;s model numbers appear (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-sizes-model-numbers-leak/">SamMobile</a>). An initial discovery showed that the Galaxy Ring will be placed under Samsung&apos;s new "Q" series for model identification. As such, the following model numbers echo that moniker.</p>
<ul><li><strong>SM-Q500</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q501</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q502</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q505</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q506</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q507</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q508</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q509</strong></li></ul>
<p>There will apparently be nine ring sizes, although the publication&apos;s digging only unearthed eight Galaxy Ring models. Supposedly, the Galaxy Ring will "correspond" with American ring sizes when it hits the market, which would mean the device would range from size 5 to size 13. That range encompasses nine sizes, so we may see one more during the launch.</p><p>Speculation states the ninth model number would feature the "SM-Q503" or "SM-Q504" model numbers.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Ring&apos;s model numbers are seemingly listed in order of smallest (SM-Q500) to largest (SM-Q509).</p>

<p>Galaxy Ring development was reported to begin in May as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-release-unit-production-rumor">a previous rumor</a> suggests Samsung plans to produce 400,000 units in time for launch. The size of the Galaxy Ring could cause Samsung to have "no shortage" of parts, meaning it might be flexible enough to meet demand if the market dictates.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ring-eyes-on-mwc-2024">appearance at MWC 2024</a> with its smart ring confirmed that it will debut in platinum silver, gold, and ceramic black finishes. Following a Samsung executive&apos;s deleted LinkedIn post, there is an expectation that the company will unveil the Galaxy Ring during the second half of 2024. This could line up perfectly with the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">second Galaxy Unpacked</a> event, which could take place on July 10 in Pairs, France.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Digital Chat Station has new information about an upcoming flagship phone from OnePlus.</li><li>The OnePlus Ace 3 Pro likely to ship with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 under the hood, and a 50MP primary camera.</li><li>The device will likely be revamped as the OnePlus 12T, if the company chooses to bring it to the global market.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The OnePlus Ace 3 Pro is the next anticipated smartphone from the company after it launched the Ace 3 and Ace 3V in March this year. While the launch details are yet to be determined, new information from the prolific tipster reveals what to expect from the next handset from OnePlus for the Chinese region.</p><p>According to the tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942#:~:text=19%2006%3A31-,Ace3p%E2%80%99s,-new%20machine%20has">Digital Chat Station</a> on Weibo, the upcoming OnePlus Ace 3 Pro will be a performance-driven flagship Android phone from the company featuring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC underneath coupled with at least 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:865px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.53%;"><img id="LCjG56xb3SfZiQBwZwKu5a" name="OnePlus-Ace-3-Pro-leaked-details.jpg" alt="Leaked details about the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCjG56xb3SfZiQBwZwKu5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="865" height="290" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device will also have a metal frame sandwiched between a 1.5K curved screen and a glass body texture featuring a new coating process, the tipster notes. The other parameters include a 50MP primary camera, presumably the same one we saw early this year on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, and a telephoto lens that may have 2x zoom. Digital Chat Station further hints at a significant battery capacity bump over the previous one.</p><p>The new Pro device will be coming as the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-2-pro-launch">Ace 2 Pro</a> from last year. Similar to previous models, last year&apos;s variant was exclusive to the Chinese market. However, the first Ace Pro was rebranded as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review">OnePlus 10T</a> for the global market, while the company chose to skip the next iteration (OnePlus 11T) for the global market last year. </p><p>If the company releases the OnePlus 12T this year, it will presumably be a rebranded Ace 3 Pro. While the launch is still speculative at this point, per the previous model launch time frame, we can expect the device to see the light of day sometime this fall in the Chinese region, followed by a global debut if the company chooses to launch so.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Gemini assistant app might soon play your favorite song through voice command.</li><li>The assistant app is testing a new Music setting that allows users to select their preferred streaming service.</li><li>The feature needed to be improved for the new assistant app, especially since it's being considered a replacement for the Google Assistant app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Gemini has been adding more integration across Google products for quite some time now. While it is good to see the integration and the advancements it brings to the table, the Gemini chatbot still has limitations, such as users being unable to ask it to play a song from a dedicated streaming platform. Well, new information reveals that&apos;s likely to change soon.</p><p>According to Android tipster AssembleDebug (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.co/cjjPPLr7Lx">PiunikaWeb</a>), Gemini Assistant will soon add new music preferences, which lets users link their favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like Spotify or YouTube Music, for example. Per the screenshots shared by AssembleDebug, users will see the Music option in the Gemini Settings, which notes, "Select preferred services used to play music."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">✨Gemini to finally let you choose your preferred music service provider on Android📝 Read - https://t.co/cjjPPLr7Lx#Google #Gemini #Android #AI pic.twitter.com/qaurr02HAU<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1782030388816396679">April 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Tapping it would presumably give the streaming services options, although right now, the "Choose your default media provider" is blank, per the shared screenshots. The process is similar to what we are used to setups on digital assistants like Google Assistant and others.</p><p>The new setting helps users quickly play their favorite songs or playlists per the preferred music app through voice commands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini assistant app</a>, which should help ensure you don&apos;t have to specify the service each time you ask it to queue up content.</p>

<p>While the new functionality is still in the works, the official rollout might be just around the corner. Meanwhile, Gemini was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-will-soon-be-added-to-the-google-app-on-android">recently spotted</a> in the Google search app for Android with a new toggle switch.</p><p>The toggle switch was seen on the Google search app&apos;s Discover feed, allowing users to shift between Google Search and Gemini Assistant. The same approach was also seen on the Google app for iOS, although this functionality is also still in the works and is yet to be available to the public. </p><p>It looks like Google is prepping up with some juicy updates for its Gemini assistant, which we may hear more about at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a> in May.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into Google's Circle to Search code seemingly shows two new updates on the way: "Copy Image" and "Share Image."</li><li>The former option will let users edit the snapshot they've taken through the Android editor before placing it elsewhere.</li><li>"Share Image" lets users in Circle to Search quickly share what they've highlighted instead of running a query through the Search engine.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Circle to Search seems primed to pick up two new options that could help speed up our queries and sharing.</p><p>As spotted by AssembleDebug via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/20/circle-to-search-copy-share-images/">PunikaWeb</a>, Google&apos;s gesture-based search feature is preparing to roll out the "Copy Image" and "Share Image" options. When tapping the former, the code suggests users will be able to copy what is contained within Circle to Search&apos;s frame. After which, the captured snapshot will be thrown into the device&apos;s image editor.</p><p>Users are said to find extra options like editing, annotations, and a share option for "supported apps."</p><p>The tipster discovered that the "Share Image" option only lets users quickly send what they&apos;ve screenshot to others. When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is active, highlighting a specific area and tapping "Share Image" will immediately produce Android&apos;s sharing sheet full of contacts and apps.</p><p>It also seems that users can toss that screenshot into their Cloud storage.</p><p>Additionally, Google is preparing to alter the design of the area of selection users see when using Circle to Search. Instead of the rounded corners that put things into a frame, users will soon see the classic pull tabs, similar to highlighting text, which should make it easier to adjust the selected area.</p><p>The tipster suggests Google is preparing to bring these new additions to Circle to Search on Pixel devices. But it seems fair to expect these features and changes to arrive on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, too.</p>

<p>Google revealed its AI-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> back in January. The feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/circle-to-search-rolling-out-to-google-pixel-8">lets Pixel 8 series owners</a> and the Galaxy S24 search for items by scribbling, highlighting, or tapping items on their display. Doing so will produce a small menu from the bottom of the UI that features Google Search&apos;s answer to whatever was selected. </p><p>Moreover, users have the option to add a question alongside the snapshot Circle to Search popped into the engine. Highlighting clothing options brings up relevant retail options from across the web.</p><p>In March, Google brought the handy AI feature to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/circle-to-search-will-roll-out-to-more-devices">even more Android devices</a>, such as the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Samsung even rolled it out for all of its flagship devices launched in 2023. Circle to Search was upgraded during that time, as the company included translation functionality.</p><p>Users were given a translate icon (similar to Google Translate) that will automatically display a section&apos;s text in a preferred language.</p>

<p>Just like past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> with "Plus" in the name, this S24 device is all about balance. The Plus isn&apos;t quite as large or as powerful as the premium Galaxy S24 Ultra, but you get more RAM and better specs than the base model. I&apos;m talking about thoughtful details like a stunning AMOLED QHD+ 6.7-inch display, an outstanding battery that&apos;ll last all day with ease, and a sleek, flat panel construction that reminded us of an iPhone. And of course, like the other phones in the Galaxy S24 series, you&apos;ll be getting seven years of software support and access to all of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that you&apos;ve been hearing about.</p><p>Sure, if you have an old device to trade in or you want to make a change to your wireless service, there are certainly better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">Samsung Galaxy S24 deals</a> out there. But if you prefer the no-strings simplicity of an unlocked phone, this is the best deal you&apos;re going to find (at least until Prime Day rolls around).</p>

<p>Meta Quest is going open-source. Meta Horizon OS, the rebranded name for the spatial software behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a>, is being lent out to partners like ASUS Republic of Gamers, Lenovo, and Xbox to make their own spin-off versions of VR headsets with Quest games and apps.</p><p>Meta will share popular Quest features like inside-out tracking, passthrough and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-v64-room-scanning-update">room scanning</a> for mixed reality, and the Meta Quest Store of hundreds of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Quest games</a> — now renamed the "Meta Horizon Store."</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, who announced the news on Instagram, called this an update to the "metaverse" and said Meta is "partnering" with the brands above for their new headsets.</p>

<p>After Meta and Google failed to come to terms about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">bringing Android to Quest headsets</a>, Meta is essentially trying to <em>become </em>Android, with Quest headsets as the stock Pixels of the VR world and other brands taking on specific niches like power gaming or productivity.</p><p>Meta&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox">blog post announcement</a> explains that ASUS ROG, for instance, will make an "all-new performance gaming headset." Just as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro</a> is the fastest Android phone on the market, the unnamed ASUS Quest spin-off could be the fastest VR headset for gaming, with access to both Quest games and Air Link for PC VR. </p><p>"With Meta Horizon OS, ASUS and Republic of Gamers will build the gaming headset of the next generation," says ASUS co-CEO S.Y. Hsu.</p>

<p>Lenovo, which helped Meta design the hardware for the Oculus Rift S, will make its own "mixed reality devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment." This would presumably compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a> and have similar features to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Quest Pro 2</a>.</p><p>The splashiest news is that Meta and Xbox are making a "limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox." We assume it&apos;ll make Xbox Cloud Gaming the default app so you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xbox-game-pass-meta-quest-launch">stream Xbox games</a> right away, but we don&apos;t know what other Xbox-themed features or console UI changes will come to the headset. We&apos;ve asked Meta for more information and will update if we hear back.</p>

<p>Aside from offering the same Quest games, software, and UI, these headsets will use the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">XR2+</a>) as the Meta Quest 3. So whatever Meta&apos;s partners call their headsets, they will be Quest 3 spin-offs in most respects. </p><p>Meta, which has historically struggled to get app developers to buy into the Quest ecosystem, is using the Meta Horizon OS rebrand to tempt mobile developers onto the platform. </p><p>"We&apos;re also developing a new spatial app framework that helps mobile developers create mixed reality experiences. Developers will be able to use the tools they’re already familiar with to bring their mobile apps to Meta Horizon OS," the post reads.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see whether the Meta Horizon OS rebranding pays off, and if they can successfully supplant Android XR as the ecosystem of choice for VR hardware makers. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dZrHMueBaZVopZ8LzDUYbn" name="google-daydream-colors.jpg" alt="All the colors of the original Google Daydream View headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZrHMueBaZVopZ8LzDUYbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In early March, I talked about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">Google abandoned VR years ago</a> in my weekly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">ThVRsday column</a>. Daydream was supposed to be the first major standalone VR operating system, as it was built on Android to help companies easily implement it into their own VR hardware. Like Android, it offered a unified app store and a basic set of capabilities to make VR development easier.</p><p>However, a problem happened just three years after its announcement: Google abandoned it. Google is infamous for abandoning products, and while it sometimes makes sense, few companies have a products and services graveyard as big as Google. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">KilledByGoogle website</a> proves that.</p><p>Ironically, the year Google killed off Daydream was the same year Meta launched the original Oculus Quest. As we now know, Meta&apos;s strategy of launching standalone headsets and shifting its focus was the right move.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is infamous for abandoning products, and while it sometimes makes sense, few companies have a products and services graveyard as big as Google.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If Meta has done anything right over the past 10 years since it acquired the Oculus brand, it&apos;s supporting its hardware. While dedicated Rift hardware is no longer supported — most of it launched at least half a decade ago now anyway — Quest hardware has been supported in ways that even smartphones would be jealous of.</p><p>Every single month, Meta delivers a new software update that brings new features to its headsets and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-v64-room-scanning-update">sometimes upgrades them</a>. Not only that, but the original Oculus Quest is only just now being <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-1-end-of-new-app-support">sent out to pasture</a> five years after its release. That substantial because the Quest 2 sold at least 20x the number of headsets of the original Quest, yet, Meta kept supporting and updating it throughout that time.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If Meta has done anything right over the past 10 years since it acquired the Oculus brand, it's supporting its hardware.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>What&apos;s not immediately clear is how well third parties will keep their headsets updated. Will this be similar to Android, where companies are responsible for their own headset updates? Or will this be more like Windows, where Microsoft updates the OS and the hardware has separate drivers?</p><p>Android Central has contacted Meta for answers to these questions and more, but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p><p>If nothing, Meta&apos;s penchant for keeping its OS regularly and quickly updated bodes well for the future of third-party headsets from companies like Lenovo, ASUS ROG, and Microsoft Xbox.</p>

<p>Plus, it looks like Meta has listened to feedback and is working on fixing its app store. The company says it&apos;s "beginning the process of removing the barriers between the Meta Horizon Store and App Lab." Currently, the Meta Horizon Store is tightly curated but offers no explanation for why some apps make it to the "real" store while others are stuck in "App Lab limbo."</p><p>Meta says that App Lab titles will receive a dedicated section on the Meta Horizon Store on all Meta Horizon OS-powered devices. This has the potential to address the biggest issue with the Quest&apos;s struggles with VR developers, but it doesn&apos;t quite solve Meta&apos;s lack of 2D apps.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is expected to announce Android XR at Google I/O in mid-May, opening up a massive amount of competition in the AR/VR space.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Apple Vision Pro famously launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">hundreds of thousands of iOS apps</a> available on day one. Meanwhile, only a few dozen 2D apps exist on the Meta Horizon Store.</p><p>While Meta and Google continue to bicker about Google Play Store access, Meta says its new initiative will help developers bring spatial apps to the platform. Developers "will be able to use the tools they&apos;re already familiar with to bring their mobile apps to Meta Horizon OS." Meta says it&apos;s trying to work with Google to bring the Play Store to the Meta Horizon platform, but so far, talks have fallen through.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google is expected to unveil Android XR at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a> in mid-May, powering the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a> along with headsets from other partners. Android XR will ship with the Google Play Store, although it&apos;s not clear yet how Google plans to adapt existing 2D apps into "spatial apps," as they&apos;re called.</p><p>It won&apos;t be long now until we find out who does it better, but one thing is clear: competition is good for everyone, and the XR industry is about to see a massive influx of competing headsets and operating systems in a way we haven&apos;t seen since Apple redefined the smartphone experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly rolling out a second OTA update for a few Pixel users following problems with the initial April patch.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/21/second-pixel-april-update/">9to5Google</a>, the company has started rolling out a second April patch for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 7 series and the Pixel Fold. Users were reporting issues about their Pixel&apos;s cell service following the recent April update, and it seems salvation has already arrived for devices operating on Verizon&apos;s cellular network as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/google-pixel-8-update/">provided an update</a> about the update&apos;s second serving.</p><p>The Pixel 8 and Pixel 7 series will find version AP1A.240405.002.<strong>B1</strong>, while Pixel Fold owners will see version AP1A.240405.002.<strong>A2</strong>. Verizon states this update is aimed at correcting "performance improvements for LTE call/data and network issues." The update is small, rolling in at around 7MB.</p><p>Google has also posted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">factory and OTA images</a> for the new patch. Users will find the addition marked as "B1" or "A2," depending on the device.</p>

<p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1c8mggf/new_april_update/">took to Reddit</a> after one who wrote to Google Support received a response about the issues. The company confirmed that a patch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> and newer phones was on the way. However, one user still encountered cellular problems with the patch, as they noted missing calls two days after sideloading the update. This seems to be an isolated issue, as others who&apos;ve received it from Verizon seem to be cruising along without a problem.</p><p>Meanwhile, it seems that AT&T and Google Fi customers are still waiting on the second patch, as noted by 9to5. However, those users could sideload the patch via Google&apos;s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">OTA/factory image</a> files if they&apos;re comfortable with it.</p><p>Google rolled out its initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-april-2024-update">April 2024 security patch</a> at the top of the month, and it came packed with loads of fixes. The company aimed to fix 28 "general" security fixes, with 25 reserved for its Pixel devices. The patch notes highlighted two security flaws that Google believed were being actively exploited by wrongdoers, urging Pixel owners to update promptly.</p><p>The rest of the patch offered camera stability fixes when zooming for a host of Pixel phones alongside a black halo artifact fix for the Pixel 8 viewfinder.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I didn&apos;t pay too much attention to the Find X7 Ultra when I got the device in mid-January. It wasn&apos;t launching outside China, so I focused instead on devices that would debut globally. Then I got caught up in the 2024 phone launch cycle, and the Find X7 Ultra sat in a drawer for the better part of a month.</p><p>I used the phone a little bit while testing the cameras on the Magic 6 Pro, but it was only after I started using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> that I started to understand its potential. I did a round of testing with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Find X7 Ultra, and had to do a double-take when I pulled up both sets of photos on my monitor; surely, there must have been an error with the labeling, because the Find X7 Ultra was <em>better</em> than the Xiaomi 14 Ultra in a lot of situations.</p><p>But there wasn&apos;t. The Find X7 Ultra somehow managed to take better photos, and portrait shots in particular were the best of any phone I used to date. So as soon as I was done testing the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, I switched over to the Find X7 Ultra. Yes, there were annoyances on the software side, as the Chinese ColorOS version is considerably different to the global build, but in the month and a half that I used the phone, it has been magnificent.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, I realized that I wasted a lot of time testing other phones when I should have been using the Find X7 Ultra instead. Welcome to the most underrated phone of 2024.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hUSavqmWDbuwQHdeJnAj9m" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-5.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hUSavqmWDbuwQHdeJnAj9m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO launched the Find X7 Ultra on January 8, and the phone is limited to the brand&apos;s home country, just like its predecessor. It is available in blue, black, and brown color variants, and all three models have a dual-tone design and leather backs. The base model has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there&apos;s a 16GB/256GB model and a 16GB/512GB variant.</p><p>You can get the Find X7 Ultra by using Chinese resellers, but considering how different ColorOS is to the global version, I wouldn&apos;t suggest doing so with the device.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-design"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-27.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no contest — the Find X7 Ultra is the best-looking phone I used in 2024. OPPO didn&apos;t make too many changes to the design from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x6-pro-review">Find X6 Pro</a>, but there are tons of smaller tweaks that make the Find X7 Ultra easier to hold and use, and much better to look at. The defining characteristic is the two-tone finish — my unit has a blue leather back, with a white frosted glass panel covering a third of the back, encircling the camera island.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sXHf5JhGSJYcNxUHUKfRZm" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-6.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sXHf5JhGSJYcNxUHUKfRZm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The effect is nothing short of gorgeous, and the Find X7 Ultra grabs attention like no other phone around. In the few instances I used the Find X7 Ultra outdoors, strangers came up to ask me about the phone — the only other device that got noticed anywhere as much was the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZMTFzzpGfdxwhDjh4RXZWi" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-3.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMTFzzpGfdxwhDjh4RXZWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, a big part of the design is the oversized camera island; it is even larger than last year, and the grooved ring bordering the island along with the silver inlay makes the cameras stand out much more than previous generations. Because of the sheer size of the camera island, there is no wobble when using the phone on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9EsYb89rXTRM3wvNpmuCGi" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-7.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EsYb89rXTRM3wvNpmuCGi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO continues to use curvy designs; the Find X7 Ultra has symmetric curves at the front and back, and it makes using the device that much more enjoyable. The weight distribution is ideal, the leather back is a delight to hold, and the rounded edges and smooth curves means you get a great in-hand feel. At 221g, the phone isn&apos;t too heavy, and there&apos;s enough room on the sides to hold the device without any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nJyxPYUx3Siz8vePSntYei" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-9.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJyxPYUx3Siz8vePSntYei.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there&apos;s the alert slider to the left. I like that the alert slider is now on OPPO phones as well; I use it extensively on OnePlus devices, so it&apos;s good to see more devices getting the hardware toggle. That said, the usage is different; while you can still toggle between ring and vibrate modes by moving the slider, the position at the top now toggles a VIP mode, which turns off mic, camera, and location access. That&apos;s just one of the dozens of ways the Chinese build of ColorOS is different to the global model, but I&apos;ll cover those in the software section below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NdiqJsU7vi9hwyHtVmDGrk" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-11.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdiqJsU7vi9hwyHtVmDGrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no titanium model of the Find X7 Ultra, but the phone uses an aluminum frame, and it feels just as premium as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Magic 6 Pro. And it gets IP68 ingress protection, giving it the same ability to withstand the elements as the best Android phones.</p><p>Overall, I like how OPPO iterated on the design of the Find X6 Pro to deliver what is the best-looking device of the year — it&apos;s a shame that the phone isn&apos;t available globally.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-display"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sm4NYuqz8xV47hvNcX7ub4" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-26.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sm4NYuqz8xV47hvNcX7ub4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X7 Ultra has a 6.82-inch AMOLED panel, and it goes up to 120Hz refresh. While that&apos;s all standard these days, what&apos;s unique about the device is how bright it is able to get: 1,600 nits in daily use, 2,600 nits in HBM mode, and 4,500 nits in HDR content. Like last year, there&apos;s a Gorilla Glass Victus 2 layer over the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Zth6dWoxk9oCr3oAYp3Gsj" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-14.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zth6dWoxk9oCr3oAYp3Gsj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I didn&apos;t see a noticeable difference between the phone and its rivals; if anything, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Vivo X100 Pro managed to get brighter in daily use. The Find X7 Ultra&apos;s differentiator is when viewing HDR content, and the phone holds up incredibly well in this regard.</p><p>Like most other high-end phones, the Find X7 Ultra gets LTPO tech, with the phone able to dynamically adjust refresh between 1Hz and 120Hz. You can manually adjust refresh between 60Hz and 120Hz, and the resolution can also be changed; it&apos;s set to FHD out of the box, but you can easily toggle QHD+ (3168 x 1440).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jiDz5iqcJChX4EMrAmJB44" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-15.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jiDz5iqcJChX4EMrAmJB44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are vibrant out of the box, and I had no issues in this area whatsoever. Contrast levels are similarly excellent, and you get a decent amount of configurability when it comes to adjusting the colors. In fact, the panel is identical to that of the OnePlus 12.</p>
<p>There&apos;s plenty of customizability when it comes to the always-on mode, and interestingly, you get a lot of extras that you don&apos;t see in the global ColorOS build. The in-screen reader is ideally positioned to use one-handed, and the bezels around the panel are thinner than last year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tfXDL4jcxhhC8tsKeCcM75" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-25.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tfXDL4jcxhhC8tsKeCcM75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most high-end phones have similar hardware, and there isn&apos;t much to differentiate devices in this regard. The Find X7 Ultra also uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and my unit has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. I didn&apos;t see any problems relating to the hardware, and outside of software quibbles, the phone was fluid throughout.</p>

<p>Just like the OnePlus 12, the Find X7 Ultra posts conservative figures in synthetic workloads; it suggests an aggressive thermal limit, and in 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay stress test, the phone got a stability score of 57%, much less than what its rivals managed. The phone went up to 48 degrees Celsius, so even though it gets hot, you don&apos;t really see the resultant gains in extended use.</p>
<p>That said, I didn&apos;t notice any lag while gaming — admittedly, I didn&apos;t play as many games on the phone, but in the few hour-long sessions I managed, I got stable framerates without any jitter. Also, there was no overheating in regular use.</p>
<p>The Find X7 Ultra has everything you need in terms of connectivity: there&apos;s Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, dual-band GPS, AptX HD codecs, LHDC, and a USB-C port that&apos;s based on the USB 3.2 standard. The vibration motor continues to be excellent, delivering granular feedback and extensive customizability.</p>

<p>The Find X7 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery, and it has 100W charging tech, with a charger bundled in the box. The phone also has 50W wireless charging along with 10W reverse wireless charging, and honestly, I didn&apos;t bother with either. It takes just over 30 minutes to charge the battery, and in over a month of regular use, I didn&apos;t leave the Find X7 Ultra plugged in overnight even once — there&apos;s just no need to do so.</p><p>Anyway, battery life has been reliable throughout; I easily got over a day&apos;s worth of use consistently, and there is no battery anxiety whatsoever. The only point I&apos;ll note in this regard is that the battery doesn&apos;t last as long as the Magic 6 Pro, and that&apos;s not astonishing considering Honor&apos;s phone has a larger 5600mAh unit. That said, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra with the same 5000mAh battery manages to last longer, and it doesn&apos;t have memory management that&apos;s anywhere as aggressive.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o3aQoi7cfGvLUxvRhGwdcj" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-4.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3aQoi7cfGvLUxvRhGwdcj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO always fielded decent cameras on its phones, but the Find X7 Ultra takes things to a whole new level. The phone has <em>four</em> 50MP cameras at the back — just like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — with a primary f/1.8 1-inch Sony LYT-900 module that&apos;s joined by an f/2.0 wide-angle lens based on Sony&apos;s LYT-600, an f/2.6 telephoto that uses the Sony IMX890 going up to 3x optical zoom, and a secondary f/4.3 telephoto based on the Sony IMX858 that hits 6x.</p>
<p>Outside of the wide-angle lens, all other cameras has dedicated OIS lenses. There&apos;s a 32MP camera at the front, and it does a decent job with selfies. The camera interface hasn&apos;t changed, and you get the same orange accents and leaf shutter sound that&apos;s standard on all phones with Hasselblad integration.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a new Master mode that has custom effects, and the Pro mode is bundled into this section. All four lenses can shoot 4K video at 60fps, and video recording in general is much better than previous models. Low-light videos in particular are terrific, and you get the ability to shoot in Dolby Vision with all the lenses, and it has better dynamic range throughout.</p>

<p>Photos taken with the main camera are outstanding. There is plenty of detail, vibrancy, and dynamic range, and you don&apos;t get any artifacting with foliage or clouds. The main camera also shoots at 2x, and shots are similarly detailed. But it&apos;s the telephoto shots that are noteworthy — the Find x7 Ultra produces standout shots at 3x and 6x, and you get usable shots up to 10x.</p>

<p>The phone holds its own in low-light scenarios, delivering shots with excellent detail, accurate colors, and minimal noise levels. The 3x and 6x lenses do a great job in challenging situations, and while the wide-angle lens isn&apos;t quite as good as the main camera, it is still better than what you get on most phones.</p>

<p>But it&apos;s the portrait shots that are truly outstanding; the phone automatically uses the 3x lens to take portraits, but you can use the 6x and the main camera as well. There&apos;s detailed background segmentation and good rendition of detail, and you can adjust the intensity of the background blur.</p><p>On the whole, the Find X7 Ultra is a fantastic package, and I prefer its color balance to that of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra in a few scenarios. It outshines the Magic 6 Pro, and is in a different league altogether against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> — it is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a> available today. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-software"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yAJwrTJFKHN7SzHnbjm9Nj" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-24.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yAJwrTJFKHN7SzHnbjm9Nj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X7 Ultra runs ColorOS 14, and although it is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, it is very different to the global build. As the phone is only available in China, there are a lot of unique features that you don&apos;t get in other regions, and honestly, setting up the phone the way I wanted was a challenge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JrDVuLPZriikyrqtXmuJ4" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-16.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrDVuLPZriikyrqtXmuJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Installing the Play Store was straightforward enough, but the Chinese ColorOS build does things very differently when it comes to permission management and notification access. So when I had to configure Google Pay, it wouldn&apos;t allow me to use SMS Organizer — my preferred SMS client — and would only send an SMS if the default Messages service was used.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4i8NZhMDu6WYeA354WnD9o" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-17.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4i8NZhMDu6WYeA354WnD9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After switching over, I had to then enter the password for my ColorOS account to send an authorization text; most Android phones do this behind the scenes, and having to enter a password to send a verification text is more restrictive than even iOS. Talking about restrictive features, using Bitwarden on the Find X7 Ultra continues to be an exercise in futility; even after enabling the autofill feature and giving the password manager the requisite access, the autofill service just wouldn&apos;t load, and every time, I had to go into the vault and manually grab the password.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J3U7xikpeLnqFJYWx2p6f3" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-20.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J3U7xikpeLnqFJYWx2p6f3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t have issues with notifications for the most part, but I had to manually whitelist apps and allow lock screen notifications to get push alerts, and memory management is more aggressive than the global build of ColorOS. I use DND mode throughout the day so as not to be bothered by notifications, but I whitelist all calls (I get a lot of packages). However, that didn&apos;t work in this instance, and whenever I set DND, calls would be silenced regardless of what I configured in the settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kFpMsvHkcn3vVNgZnEraP3" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-21.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFpMsvHkcn3vVNgZnEraP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO phones in the past had an annoying habit where they would use a hard-coded Google DNS configuration, so even if you use a custom DNS with your router (like I do), it wouldn&apos;t recognize that. Thankfully, that isn&apos;t the case on the Find X7 Ultra, but there were instances where it would randomly route to Google DNS intermittently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fK6EqWkFfdAhHHB9zB4Vyn" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-18.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fK6EqWkFfdAhHHB9zB4Vyn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You don&apos;t get Google Assistant either, with the phone featuring the brand&apos;s Breeno assistant instead. The app drawer and notification pane are standard, but you don&apos;t get as many custom widgets. What&apos;s annoying is that there is much more bloatware pre-installed than on the global build, but it can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>What I like is just how many updates the phone has gotten over the last three months; I count at least four updates with stability tweaks, camera tuning enhancements, and feature additions that have made their way to the device, and you just don&apos;t get this level of frequency on the global ColorOS build.</p>
<p>On that note, the Find X7 Ultra will get four platform updates and five years of security updates, and going by the way it is picking up monthly updates, it should get the stable Android 15 well ahead of the global build.</p><p>That said, given the number of things to tweak, I wouldn&apos;t recommend buying the phone unless you&apos;ve used ColorOS extensively in the past and know how to get the most out of the interface. There are just too many changes to the global version, and it isn&apos;t worth the effort to tame the interface to your preferences.</p>

<p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is the closest rival to the Find X7 Ultra, with Xiaomi also offering a strong camera package with outstanding auxiliary lenses. There isn&apos;t much to differentiate either device in this area, and both phones deliver outstanding photos and videos in any scenario. That said, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is available outside China, and you get the Play Store and a fluid interface that&apos;s considerably easier to use.</p><p>Honor&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> is another device that nails the basics. It has a gorgeous design, the cameras hold their own against the Find X7 Ultra, and while I prefer OPPO&apos;s tuning, the Magic 6 Pro isn&apos;t far behind. And just like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, you can buy the Magic 6 Pro outside China, although it isn&apos;t available in quite as many markets.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want one of the best camera packages of 2024</li><li>You need a phone with a gorgeous design</li><li>You want a vibrant 120Hz AMOLED panel that gets bright</li><li>You need the best hardware available today</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need software that's easy to use</li><li>You want official warranty</li></ul>
<p>I used all the launches in the Find X series up to this point, and the Find X7 Ultra has significant upgrades across the board. The screen is noticeably brighter than its predecessor, I love the two-tone design, and the leather texture combined with the frosted glass finish around the camera island gives the phone a level of refinement that you just don&apos;t get elsewhere.</p><p>And there&apos;s the camera island itself; the large housing is designed to grab attention, and the phone as a whole has a distinctive design and a comfortable in-hand feel. I have no problems when it comes to the hardware, and while a 1TB version would have been nice, it&apos;s not a huge omission. In a similar vein, the battery life has been reliable, and while the device doesn&apos;t last quite as long as its rivals, I still got over a day&apos;s worth of use easily.</p><p>But it&apos;s the cameras that are the star of the show; the quartet of 50MP cameras takes magnificent photos and videos, and the portrait shots in particular rivaled that of my mirrorless camera — and that&apos;s a sizeable achievement. It&apos;s because of the cameras that I stuck with the irritating software, and alongside the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, the Find X7 Ultra is one of my favorite camera packages of 2024.</p><p>OPPO launched the Find X5 Pro globally, but it chose to limit the Find X6 Pro and the Find X7 Ultra to China. Thankfully, that policy is changing soon; upcoming Find phones will debut globally, and that&apos;s down to OPPO finally settling its lawsuit with Nokia. So even though the Find X7 Ultra isn&apos;t available outside China, there is reason to be excited.</p>
