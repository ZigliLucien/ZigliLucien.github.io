<p>Best buy&apos;s Geek Squad is reportedly shutting down its dedicated Samsung repair service at Best Buy stores, according to a recent report by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24164777/best-buy-ends-samsung-repair-program-geek-squad"> The Verge</a>. Samsung&apos;s Authorized Service Provider program (ASP) lets certain Best Buy stores repair phones with original Samsung parts, tools, and training— allowing users to schedule an appointment online to get their phones fixed.</p><p>The news trickled down from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/1cst3kr/samsung_asp/">Geek Squad&apos;s Reddit thread,</a> which indicated that Best Buy was canceling the program. </p><p>One of the users on the thread seemed to be taken aback by this and said, "In my precinct, I was the only one disappointed because I really like doing Samsung repairs, while everyone else was happy." </p><p>The user added that they enjoyed being the person who was fully trained to do the SASP repairs and didn&apos;t quite understand why Best Buy went ahead with this move since the program was doing so well at their location.</p><p>While other employees who were a part of this program really wanted it to end and were surprised how this didn&apos;t happen any sooner.</p><p>"I managed Geek Squad for close to 3 years and they rolled out Samsung repairs to us like 6 months into me being there. We had still not successfully completed a single repair when I left," another user added.</p><p>The publication further states that Best Buy will now only repair a Samsung device  purchased at Best Buy, and only for people who have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=howtogeek&u1=UUhtgUeUpU2003529&article_name=Your+Galaxy+Phone+Is+Now+Harder+to+Get+Fixed&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fyour-galaxy-phone-is-now-harder-to-get-fixed%2F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgeek-squad%2Fgeek-squad-protection%2Fpcmcat159800050001.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat159800050001">Geek Squad Cell Phone Complete Protection insurance</a> and the replacement of any parts within the device would come at an added cost— which could be between $199 or $249.</p>

<p>In statements sent to the Verge, Samsung and Best Buy did not deny that they were going their separate ways. </p><p>“We’re in discussions with Best Buy to determine how Samsung can best support our customers moving forward,” reads a statement from Samsung head of mobile customer care Mario Renato de Castro, adding that Samsung has “more than 9,000 Samsung Mobile-certified technicians in the U.S. providing walk-in, mail-in and We Come to You van services.”</p><p>Katie Klister, Best Buy&apos;s spokesperson, said the company is evaluating the best way to support mobile customers with authorized services and repairs. </p><p>“We know how important it is to our customers that we’re there for them with the right services and expertise for their technology, and we’re currently working together with Samsung," Katie added.</p><p>According to several reports, Best Buy has taken down the option to repair Samsung phones on its website in the U.S. and only offers Apple repairs. That said, some Best Buy employees were seen putting two and two together <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/1cst3kr/comment/l47l2c3/">on Reddit</a> regarding the end of the Samsung ASP program. </p><p>One employee confirmed 18 days ago, "worth mentioning Samsung also terminated their cell phone repair program with Geek Squad the other day with very little notice or information." </p><p>Another Best Buy employee provided an internal screenshot to The Verge stating that “Samsung ASP is ending in all SASP locations,” directing them to return the parts used for repairing devices.</p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ifixit-breakup-highlights-google-efforts">iFixit</a> announcing in May that it would be ending its collaboration with Samsung, which allowed it to distribute OEM parts and repair guides, and now Best Buy following suit, it will become increasingly difficult to find authorized repair stores for when a Samsung device needs fixing. People now have to turn to third-party stores like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/">uBreakiFix</a>, the only ones offering to repair Samsung devices.</p>

When it launched in 2022, it was one of our favorite smartwatches, so naturally we&apos;re not surprised that it stood the test of time and remains one of our favorite picks on the market — especially if you can pair it with a sweet deal.</p><p>The original Pixel Watch has one of the more comfortable and lightweight feels of any smartwatch out there, along with a simple design, rotating crown, and some extremely addicting haptics. Plus, it has a display that&apos;s easy to look at, along with a well-designed UI that&apos;s highly customizable.</p>

<p>You can currently get $100 off the last-generation <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Google Pixel Watch</a> at Best Buy and other retailers right now. While it's not Google's latest-generation smartwatch, it was pretty well appreciated when it came out in 2022 and it's still a worthy contender at a lower price point than the Pixel Watch 2.</p>
<p>From the minimal design of the Pixel Watch to its user-friendly Wear OS, there are a lot of things worth appreciating here, even for a last-generation smartwatch.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Smartwatch-Stainless/dp/B0BDSHFLMZ">Amazon - $179.99</a> | <a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_pixel_watch?hl=en-US&pli=1&selections=eyJwcm9kdWN0RmFtaWx5IjoiWjI5dloyeGxYM0JwZUdWc1gzZGhkR05vIiwidmFyaWFudHMiOltbIjIiLCJOQT09Il1dLCJ0cmFkZUluIjp7InNlbGVjdGlvbiI6M319">Google - 179.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-watch-silver-stainless-steel-smartwatch-41mm-with-charcoal-active-band-wifi-bt-silver-charcoal/6521699.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e7266d8e-d38c-492a-a1e4-53d350ae4aeb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Watch: $279.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Watch: $279.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a comfortable, lightweight smartwatch and you don&apos;t mind going with one from the last generation; you&apos;re a regular user of the Fitbit app and want a watch that&apos;s already compatible.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer going with a newer product and think the Pixel Watch 2 might be a better fit for you; you need automatic workout tracking or SpO2 tracking.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind going with something that isn&apos;t the most recent release, the Google Pixel Watch is a pretty great option. It&apos;s the only last-generation smartwatch on our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a>, and there&apos;s more than one reason why.</p><p>The Pixel Watch boasts many of the classic health, GPS, and smart features associated with modern wearables. But it also has a good-looking AMOLED display, the user-friendly Wear OS, and convenient Fitbit app integration for those that already use the suite.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the Pixel Watch doesn&apos;t have true automatic workout tracking or SpO2 tracking, but for most, it has everything needed in a smartwatch. And at $100 off, it&apos;s not hard to justify—even for a last-gen offering.</p>

<hr>
<p>A Samsung executive is getting candid about the company&apos;s plans to further improve its Galaxy AI experience on its foldables and other devices.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/human-centric-hybrid-ai-opens-up-new-possibilities">Newsroom post</a>, Samsung&apos;s EVP and Head of R&D Mobile Experience, Won-Joon Choi, said the company is interested in creating a "completely new and unique AI experience." While this started with the Galaxy S24 series, Choi said there are plans to expand on its foldables.</p><p>His post highlighted that Samsung will work to "further optimize the Galaxy AI experience" for its upcoming foldables. We&apos;re expecting the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold, which the company calls "versatile" and "flexible." It&apos;s because of those devices&apos; versatility that Samsung views them as the perfect gateways to "new possibilities" surrounding Galaxy AI.</p><p>Beyond the stated plans, Samsung didn&apos;t have more to share as to what sort of new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> capabilities its foldables could see.</p><p>Elsewhere, Choi detailed the company&apos;s plans to expand its on-device AI features like "Live Translate." Samsung is working to enable Live Translate functionality on third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> with support for voice calls. Such apps could include WhatsApp and Telegram, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see as the company teases it will arrive "soon."</p><p>Since its AI language translation model does all the work on your device, the company states users can utilize it "without worrying" about privacy.</p>

<p>Samsung debuted its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-galaxy-s24-live-translate">Live Translate</a> feature through Galaxy AI during its January Unpacked event. Consumers were able to see how the language translator takes in your conversation in real time to translate and transcribe the entire conversation. The feature on supported Galaxy devices can translate up to 13 languages, such as English, French, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and more.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-language-support-announced">more language support</a> is on the way, according to a press release in April.</p><p>In other news, Samsung&apos;s executive highlighting an expansion of Galaxy AI capabilities for its upcoming foldables is a welcome sight. Considering Samsung&apos;s efforts in AI, we were already expecting the devices to feature Galaxy AI, but what could be in store remains a mystery.</p><p>For now, we have the latest batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-spotted-in-an-ad">leaked promotional imagery</a> for the upcoming Flip 6 and Fold 6, which should debut later this summer.</p>

<ul><li>A discovery from the Find My Device network app highlights Google's plans to bring AR-based directions and UWB support to Android users.</li><li>The AR directions would guide users to their UWB-supported tracker or device by layering its UI through a user's camera.</li><li>The app could give users access to AR-based directions for more than just UWB-capable trackers and devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Google still expanding the reach of its Find My Device network, signs in the app&apos;s code point toward new connectivity support.</p><p>A deep dive into version 3.1.078-1 of the Find My Device app by AssembleDebug, in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-find-my-device-uwb-ar-upgrade-apk-teardown-3449281/">Android Authority</a>, spilled upcoming UWB and AR support. Starting with the former, strings in the app&apos;s code reference "precision finding" for a UWB adapter. The tipster discovered additional "libraries" about the app supporting UWB, with a string highlighting the "startRanging call" function.</p><p>With little else to uncover about the potential UWB portion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a>, the tipster detailed the app&apos;s AR-based location discovery.</p><p>Speculation suggests Google&apos;s implementation of AR technology (through ARCore) would pair well with its UWB functionality. Essentially, the company could let users use their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone&apos;s</a> camera in the app, showing a layered augmented reality UI with directions to guide them to their lost UWB device.</p><p>However, AR-based directions to guide users to their lost objects might not be restricted to UWB-support devices. The tipster&apos;s discoveries note that strings in the code don&apos;t reference the two methods as working exclusively together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="yJxkznqjYeD9wZx4ZGK9Mf" name="samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-ar-directions.jpg" alt="Samsung provides users with AR-based location directions on their device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJxkznqjYeD9wZx4ZGK9Mf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s AR and UWB support development is still ongoing, so we likely won&apos;t see it for a while.</p><p>The post notes that Samsung uses a similar AR-based direction UI with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement">Galaxy SmartTag 2</a>. The only problem, as the publication notes, is that the feature requires a user to have a UWB-capable Galaxy phone. Google is seemingly moving toward convenience, bringing the UWB tech to the app instead.</p><p>At the end of May, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-extra-user-security-spotted">was tipped to bolster</a> its Find My Device network&apos;s user security. A new biometric security option was discovered, giving users an extra layer of safety to their devices in case their phone is away from them. This will likely work well with the network&apos;s "don&apos;t ask again" option when signing into the app using a Google account.</p><p>Additionally, the app&apos;s code referenced Google&apos;s planned "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Remote Lock</a>" feature. Google had already teased it during I/O 2024, stating a user could lock down their phone using their phone number after completing a quick security challenge. This feature isn&apos;t expected to arrive until "later this year."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-tensor-g4-benchmark-test-scores-details">Tensor G4</a> chip has leaked out and there isn&apos;t anything that should surprise anyone. We don&apos;t know everything about the new processor, but what we&apos;ve seen shows that it will be a continuation of what Google thinks is important, and best when it comes to a smartphone&apos;s brainbox.</p><p>In a set of leaked benchmarks — which really mean nothing to anyone who doesn&apos;t love running benchmarks — the G4 slightly outperforms its predecessor. That&apos;s because the processor core architecture and arrangement are pretty standard; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-arm-cpu">ARM v9-A cores</a> in a 1-3-4 arrangement.  </p>
<p>If that doesn&apos;t make much sense to you, that&apos;s OK because you don&apos;t need to know the numbers and lingo. This is a standard ARM processor without all the turbocharging that companies like Apple and Qualcomm love to do when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">making chips</a>.</p><p>While this processor will probably be just fine for most of us, it&apos;s not going to excel at playing games or doing any CPU or GPU-intensive tasks for an extended period of time. In this regard, it will act much like the Tensor G3 that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">Google Pixel 8</a> series.</p>
<p>Where it should show improvement are the areas that Google thinks really count: security and AI. Again, much like the G3 compared to the G2. If you notice a trend here, you&apos;ve stumbled across Google&apos;s not-so-secret recipe when it comes to making a "better" smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="the-google-way-2">The Google way</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2B4r9PrJFvsVkAzz87qkVh" name="google-pixel-8a-live-captions.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a's Live Captions feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2B4r9PrJFvsVkAzz87qkVh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not so long ago, the most important thing about a phone chip seemed to be the processor clock speed and how "powerful" the chip was. Bigger numbers meant a better chip, which meant a better experience in a better phone. For some folks in some cases, this is still true. But not for Google.</p><p>Google seems to want to balance a handful of important things while designing a chip specializing in the key areas where the company does things differently. It&apos;s been semi-successful and each generation is a little better at doing it than the last.</p>
<p>The biggest and arguably most important thing Google needs to consider is the power wall. Tiny batteries power phones and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">an abysmal lifespan</a>. That means efficiency matters.</p><p>A phone chip isn&apos;t a car engine. You can&apos;t keep pushing a fuel mixture into it to push it faster and faster because the supply is limited and there&apos;s no easy way to get rid of the heat it creates. The only solution is to limit the "top speed" in a way that causes less heat while using less energy. Google doesn&apos;t do a great job at this, though each generation of chip does better than the last. Hopefully, the G4 continues this trend.</p>
<p>in addition to trying to create a chip that&apos;s more efficient, Google is going the specialization route. A phone chip isn&apos;t monolithic and there are specialized processors and processor cores designed for specific tasks. This allows the chip to allocate resources more effectively, at least in theory.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="uysjo7mrABJyAA4T6ftvp" name="extreme-battery-saver-mode-pixel-6-pro-hero.jpg" alt="Extreme Battery Saver Mode Pixel 6 Pro Hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uysjo7mrABJyAA4T6ftvp.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine a team of people who specialize in different areas. You have a few people who are stronger than average and can do "heavy" work, a mathematician or two who can handle intense calculations quickly, maintainers who make sure things run how and when they should, a security guard who keeps order, and a manager who oversees everything.</p>
<p>This is how a modern phone chip and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-kernel">kernel operate</a>. Certain parts are better than others when it comes to specific tasks and when everything is routed correctly and done by the right team, things run more smoothly. Google isn&apos;t alone in this regard; every company that designs SoCs (System on Chip) uses this blueprint. The difference is where Google places the chip&apos;s strengths. </p><p>If you didn&apos;t already know, I&apos;ll tell you — don&apos;t buy a Pixel phone if you want to play games or have the most powerful chip. Google has never been great in these areas and probably never will. If you need power and speed, buy a phone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-qualcomm-xr-chipset-announcement-coming">new Qualcomm chip</a>. If you need the most powerful and fastest chip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">buy an iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>Google thinks people are better served in a completely different way. In Google&apos;s vision, modern smartphones are defined by AI. While 2024 seems to be the year of the AI beast, this really isn&apos;t something new; Google has been heavily leaning on AI since the days of the Nexus 5. the birth of the Pixel series, and more importantly, the Tensor SoC, allows Google to do more of it.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini replacing Assistant</a> or AI-powered search results. Those are examples of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">stupid AI</a> coming faster than necessary because nobody — including Google — is really ready for them. I&apos;m talking about on-device edge computing models powered by Google&apos;s machine learning algorithms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XEqwWyruhp9tJEkwMXXZnD" name="Google-Pixel-8-magic-editor.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 hands on with AI features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XEqwWyruhp9tJEkwMXXZnD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the kind of AI we actually enjoy. Oddly enough, it&apos;s also the kind of AI that many of us don&apos;t know is powered by AI. I&apos;m not sure if there is a correlation there or not.</p><p>Either way, when AI makes your battery last longer, your photos look better, helps you talk to people who speak a different language, and can better understand what it hears, we love to use it. Google is a software company and can do this with software provided it has the right access to the right hardware. That&apos;s why the Tensor chip is designed the way it is.</p>
<p>Google has no idea if its vision of the perfect smartphone will resonate with us, but it&apos;s counting on it. Pixel phones are polarizing among the tech community and for every person who loves them there is one that hates them.</p><p>Android is an extremely competitive and unique commodity. With so many great minds working on different ways to use and present it, Google isn&apos;t guaranteed to win here. The best thing it can do is continue to run with what it thinks is working, and the Tensor G4 is proof that it is doing just that.</p>

<p>This week, Schell Games launched its latest VR game, Silent Slayer. In it, players are tasked with de-arming traps that protect a vampire&apos;s coffin in order to gain access to its inhabitants and slay them for the good of humankind. It&apos;s a brilliant marriage of puzzler and horror game with the team&apos;s trademark humor thrown in for good measure.</p><p>Surprisingly, several fantastic horror games broke the mold this year and challenged what I expected from them. Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s: Help Wanted 2 is a fantastic example of rebuilding a game from the ground up for VR, leading many fans on Reddit and other channels to recommend that new players start with that game first before moving on to something else.</p><p>The NOPE Challenge is another that just debuted last month and combines obstacle courses and light fitness activities with horror to create something wholly unique and, yet, still terrifying — especially if you have a phobia of spiders, snakes, clowns, heights, or one of the many categories of terror you&apos;ll be wading through.</p>

<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0J0qGEkPDpQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I&apos;ll begin with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5353670608005479/">Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire</a>, the newest title from veteran VR developer Schell Games, who has been behind some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> like Among Us VR and the I Expect You to Die series. As you might expect from the studio&apos;s other titles, Silent Slayer mixes in plenty of clever puzzles with its horror-themed gameplay.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Silent Slayer is a bit like the classic board game Operation...except you're tasked with somehow killing the patient, a supposed immortal vampire.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Silent Slayer can be thought of as the classic board game Operation with its core philosophy turned on its head. Instead of trying to perform surgery to save the patient — one mistake can kill said person — Silent Slayer tasks players with killing the patient, instead. That patient, of course, is a deadly vampire that&apos;ll drain your blood as soon as look at you.</p><p>Each level begins with a task to reassemble a shattered relic, each relic containing runes that you&apos;ll later have to trace to bind the vampire. The first few levels&apos; relics are simple enough but become increasingly more difficult as the pieces get smaller and more chaotically shattered.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nfj5VP7QingH6ynutxDFCT" name="silent-slayer-stake-01.jpg" alt="Binding a vampire in Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nfj5VP7QingH6ynutxDFCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Schell Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you assemble the relics, you&apos;ll be given the history of the vampire you&apos;re about to face. The castle you visit is filled with vampires on every floor who come out every so often to feed but are capable of being slain just before they emerge.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As you might expect, the older and more formidable the vampire, the more complex and dangerous the traps will be to potential slayers.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each vampire slumbers in a stereotypical upright coffin, and each has skillfully prepared its coffin with traps that you&apos;ll need to remove and disarm. As you might expect, the older and more formidable the vampire, the more complex and dangerous the traps will be to potential slayers.</p><p>The final blow to a vampire is, of course, a stake through the heart, but that, too, has been turned on its head a bit. You&apos;ll need to perform quite a bit of magic to reveal the vampire&apos;s vulnerable spot and none of these tricks can be done while making too much noise or getting too close to the vampire. One false move will end up in the player&apos;s death.</p><p>While Schell Games could have easily just made a vampire-themed puzzle game, the company worked hard to inject a palpable sense of fear and tension into each level that&apos;ll keep you moving as slowly and carefully as you physically can, taxing your senses and keeping your heart racing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pcq7CMp54yEtNLLPqfBYLT" name="silent-slayer-tools-01.jpg" alt="The tools available in Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcq7CMp54yEtNLLPqfBYLT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Schell Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I had any one complaint, it&apos;s that replaying each level after multiple failures can be a bit annoying, as I found myself growing impatient the more I failed. It&apos;s human nature, of course, but it also means that less skilled players might find themselves taking a few breaks and coming back to finish the game&apos;s 4-6 hour-long campaign.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>These are fully realized rooms in an ancient castle, sometimes filled with casks of alcohol, and other times you'll be disarming traps as glowing red eyes stare at you from paintings on the walls.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While that might not sound long enough for some players, it&apos;s plenty of time to explore the gamut of the levels included without tiring of the concept.</p><p>Visually, the game is incredibly convincing and utterly beautiful on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. You&apos;re not just standing in a blank space with a random coffin in the middle. These are fully realized rooms in an ancient castle, sometimes filled with casks of alcohol, and other times you&apos;ll be disarming traps as glowing red eyes stare at you from paintings on the walls.</p><p>As I expect from Schell Games, there are a number of accessibility options that ensure players of every height and skill level can play the game — within reason, of course. A quick height adjustment bar is present on your tools table to make it comfortable to immediately sit or stand during any level. There&apos;s also no virtual movement at all, so you&apos;ll only be moving around as often as your physical body moves.</p>
<h2 id="taking-this-show-on-the-road-2">Taking this show on the road</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7P6qU0d2sw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The polar opposite of that is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/4209841532432878/">NOPE CHALLENGE</a>, a game I&apos;d rather not write in all capital letters again but one featuring lots of movement and a large variety of environments. In the Nope Challenge, you&apos;re tasked with facing your fears while moving through a themed level, each of the nine levels being situated under a specific category.</p><p>What I love about the Nope Challenge is that it doesn&apos;t rely on cheap thrills or jump scares to get players noping out. Each of the game&apos;s levels will take between five and ten minutes to complete, depending on your skill level, and any of them can be skipped by slapping that NOPE button on your left wrist.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There are few things more harrowing than climbing a huge Ninja Warrior obstacle course while a giant, hungry spider chases you.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The purpose of the game is to face your fears, not to "beat" it, although it presents plenty of secrets and collectables throughout each level for folks who love that sort of thing.</p><p>As you&apos;ll see in the initial playthrough above, the first series of levels deals with heights but throws in plenty of additional fears as you progress. There are few things more harrowing than climbing a huge Ninja Warrior obstacle course while a giant, hungry spider chases you.</p><p>Nope Challenge is even more fun when you play it in a room full of people, too. While everyone will see what&apos;s happening, there&apos;s something palpably different about experiencing it for yourself in VR. Watching it on a TV doesn&apos;t give you the feeling of being 104-stories up in the air like it does with a headset on, and clowns are so much creepier when they&apos;re actually in your face rather than on a glowing rectangle across the room.</p>

<p>Even Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s, the storied horror game that feels like it should be boring and tedious at this point, got a refreshed entry into the series with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7156077941079207/">FNAF: Help Wanted 2</a>.</p><p>The sequel to one of the most popular Quest games isn&apos;t just a cash-in cop-out. The team created an experience that feels like it was built for VR from day one instead of simply translating existing puzzles and mechanics from the flat game into VR.</p><p>Good ol&apos; Markiplier walks you through a bit of the game in the video above but there&apos;s plenty to experience beyond this video. In fact, the sequel is so good that long-time fans are recommending new VR players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/18rf2v2/shoud_i_play_five_nights_at_fredys_help_wanted_1/">start with it first</a> and then go back to the original Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s: Help Wanted.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Each of these games has a jump scare that happens just as you hit peak fear levels but they're not done in a cheap way, and they're not used as the sole mechanic of inducing horror.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s these sorts of games that are changing the paradigm of what a VR horror game can be and what makes it scary. Sure, each of these games has a jump scare that happens just as you hit peak fear levels but they&apos;re not done in a cheap way, and they&apos;re not used as the sole mechanic of inducing horror.</p><p>In many ways, they remind me of the now-classic VR horror game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wraith-oblivion-afterlife-review">Wraith: The Oblivion</a> which uses unique mechanics to immerse a player in the world, creating a unique sense of fear wrapped into a compelling story. Narrative and story-telling do a lot to make a convincing fear-based game, and titles like Silent Slayer, Nope Challenge, and FNAF: Help Wanted 2 excel at it.</p>

<ul><li>Google Keep appears to have a new feature in store for its users.</li><li>The note-taking app was found testing a window resize feature in split mode for Android devices.</li><li>When the feature rolls out officially, it will help make multitasking easier for Android tablets, foldable, and bigger Android phone users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Keep is one of the default note-taking apps for Android users, and it is now getting the most requested feature. The search giant is on the verge of rolling out the window resize feature soon, according to new findings from tipster AssembleDebug.</p><p>Google Keep users will soon be able to resize their app window on their Android devices, the tipster explains in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-keep-window-resize-3448776/">Android Authority</a>, unlike the current app version, where users can set the window to a predetermined size or to a full-screen mode.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Keep finally gets long-awaited window resizing feature ✅ https://t.co/STXvKR3OWmThis will be available on tablets and foldables in a future update. pic.twitter.com/LlkSRfgrTr<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1798377458053664955">June 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>However, according to the tipster, a new hidden flag in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> app bearing the 5.24.222.01.90 version brings in a new slide layout — allowing users to resize their windows per their preference.</p><p>The short video featured in the publication showcases the new ability in action, where users can drag the slide bar to resize the Google Keep app window. It is handy for users who multitask often and use the Keep app to take notes on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Whenever the feature rolls out officially, it presumably works even better for Android tablets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, and bigger Android phones — used mainly in landscape mode.</p>

<p>The publication further notes that the Google Calendar app supports the sliding pane option in a split window layout. The feature is expected to debut in Android handsets featuring more than 600 ppi (pixel per inch) displays.</p><p>The feature&apos;s rollout still needs to be determined; as it is currently hidden behind a flag, the official rollout of the feature seems inevitable.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Keep app has recently seen significant changes. The search giant, for instance, has rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-floating-toolbar-spotted">revamped toolbar</a> to the app, which is a floating, pill-shaped pane to take up less space and provide essential tools like the ability to create a note, a list, and a drawing/picture note.</p>

The Moto G Play is a pretty bare bones smartphone, featuring a basic, 6.5-inch LCD screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, and a minimal 32GB of storage.</p><p>While you shouldn&apos;t expect a premium-level experience with this phone, this price cut makes this basic phone look a little more appealing. With $70 off, it may be worthwhile, even if just as a short-term placeholder for your next favorite smartphone. Along with the discount, Best Buy will also give you one month free of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with this purchase.</p>

<p>The Moto G Play is a pretty minimal phone, featuring a simple LCD display and a pretty simple, albeit appealing, overall design. Its camera and overall performance leave something to be desired, but at under $100, it still doesn't feel like a bad deal.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a phone that&apos;s super affordable, without all the bells and whistles; you like the slick design of the Moto G Play and have enjoyed Motorola phones you&apos;ve had in the past; you want something cheap but without sacrificing battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> performance quality is a higher priority to you than a low sticker price; you want a phone that comes with long-term OS upgrades.</p><p>The base-level 2023 version of the Moto G Play isn&apos;t bad for such an affordable phone, though users especially appreciate it for its sleek design, its long battery life, and the comfortable and easy-to-use rear fingerprint sensor. It also comes with just 32GB of storage, alongside a decent-looking 6.5-inch LCD screen with a 90Hz refresh rate.</p><p>To be sure, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2023-review">Motorola Moto G Play</a> is nothing special when it comes to specs, and not everyone was happy with this release as an upgrade from the 2021 version. The latest Moto G Play only has 3GB of RAM and a Helio G37 processor, which makes it slightly lacking in performance speeds, but with $70 off the normal price, most casual users will still get everything they need out of this phone.</p>

<ul><li>Google states it will start "gradually rolling out" 911 texting capabilities through RCS on Android later "this winter."</li><li>Users can soon text 911 emergency services and see when they begin responding while also sending images and videos to help them.</li><li>This feature will join the likes of Fall and Crash Detection on Android.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a useful emergency services feature to Messages that lets users contact the appropriate authorities through RCS.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/messages/google-messages-rcs-911-emergency/">press release</a>, Google has partnered with RapidSOS to bring 911 texting capabilities to Messages through RCS-enabled chats. Contacting data centers through this method will let users "confirm the delivery" of their emergency requests and see when authorities are actively responding to them. Google hopes this removes the guesswork when it comes to wondering if 911 received your text.</p><p>Moreover, RCS-enabled chats allow users to send high-quality images and videos to 911, which could help them understand your situation better. Lastly, location sharing becomes possible through Google&apos;s partnership with RapidSOS as SMS texts, the old way of texting authorities, didn&apos;t have this capability.</p><p>Data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) shows that only 53% of 911 centers in the U.S. can accept text messages as communication.</p><p>Google announced today (June 6) that it will bring its RCS to 911 feature to "every 911 agency in the United States" for free. Companies involved are said to begin rolling out this new feature to call centers across the States later "this winter."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rapidsos.com/unite/">RapidSOS</a> recently debuted many new features designed to tackle public safety involving messaging, multimedia, and its HARMONY AI copilot for emergency response.</p><p>Brian Fontes, president of the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) stated, "For too long we&apos;ve asked our first responders to manage millions of emergencies with little more than voice connection. I&apos;m excited to see the paradigm be transformed for 911 agencies across the United States."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="xqYuN4aLHLhLjCENuCJKbh" name="google-messages-rapidsos-911-rcs-texts.jpg" alt="Google prepares to bring 911 RCS texting capabilities to Messages later this year." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xqYuN4aLHLhLjCENuCJKbh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, Google adds that it will continue to hone its efforts to improve access to emergency centers through RCS. The company has hopes to make RCS the "standard for emergency services everywhere."</p><p>This new capability will arrive for Android devices later this year, with Google&apos;s eyes set on the winter season.</p><p>As most message users might be aware, RCS helps keep texts private between us and the other person. With this modern texting solution joining 911 centers for emergency communications, Google sees this as a way of building upon our security and personal safety. The company has already rolled out other features to connect Android users to the authorities, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-enable-fall-detection-pixel-watch">Fall Detection</a> on the Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel-4">Crash Detection</a> on Pixels.</p>

<p>Google has revealed that Chrome is now 72% faster, achieving its highest score ever in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-google-microsoft-and-firefox-have-a-new-browser-benchmark-to-rule-them-all">latest Speedometer 3 browser benchmark</a>.</p><p>To measure how fast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> is, Google uses a mix of its own tests and industry-standard benchmarks. Speedometer 3 is a popular tool for comparing browser speeds because it closely mimics real-world usage. Google&apos;s blog post explains the recent improvements that have made Chrome faster than ever since Speedometer 3 debuted.</p><p>Google examined which functions in Speedometer were slowing down the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> the most and made specific tweaks to speed them up. For example, it improved the function that handles space-separated strings, making it faster by removing unnecessary checks. Google also made sure that duplicate stylesheets were only processed once, saving time and resources.</p><p>Other changes include optimizing memory usage when drawing shapes and reducing unnecessary processing when creating form elements. The team also identified commonly used selectors in "querySelector" and streamlined them for better performance.</p><p>Last year, Google made several changes to reach a Speedometer score of 390 in Chrome version 113. This included faster HTML parsing and updates to the DOM, benefiting not just Chrome but also Apple&apos;s WebKit browsers. Google extended some of these optimizations to improve other functions used by Speedometer 3.</p><p>Additionally, Google worked with the Harfbuzz maintainer to improve how Chrome renders fonts used by Apple macOS. This change speeds up text processing by quickly determining which glyphs need to be processed.</p><p>One key strategy for Google&apos;s performance improvements is code tiering, which involves selecting the right code to optimize further. Intel helped by contributing a method that remembers past optimization decisions so Chrome can apply them more quickly in the future.</p><p>While performance is important for a smooth web browsing experience, many users often complain about Chrome&apos;s high memory usage rather than its speed. Chrome&apos;s fast script running can take up a lot of memory, but this isn&apos;t entirely Chrome&apos;s fault as these scripts require significant resources to operate effectively.</p><p>In any case, these scores are expected to keep improving as Google continues to enhance its browser.</p>
