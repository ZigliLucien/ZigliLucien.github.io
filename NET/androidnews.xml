<ul><li>While lawmakers ponder the making of the proposed Journalism Preservation Act law, Google is previewing the consequences of that decision in a limited test.</li><li>Google is removing links to California news sites for a limited number of users due to the proposed law, which would require the company to pay publishers for links and aggregated content from news articles.</li><li>Additionally, Google is pausing investments in the California news ecosystem due to a lack of "clarity on California's regulatory environment."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Much like Canada&apos;s<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pl/charter-charte/c18_1.html"> Bill-C 18</a>, which surprised Google, California might also get this fair share of link tax. Google has consistently opposed calls for a "link tax" that would require the company to pay publishers for linked and aggregated content appearing in search results. While the California state legislature ponders the California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA), which will do just that, Google is starting to remove links to California news sites. The company announced this move in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/news/california-journalism-preservation-act-puts-news-ecosystem-at-risk/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on April 12, and although it&apos;s only a test for now, this change could become permanent if the bill becomes law.</p><p>"If passed, CJPA may result in significant changes to the services we can offer Californians and the traffic we can provide to California publishers," said Jaffer Zaidi, Google&apos;s vice president of Global News Partnerships. "If enacted, CJPA in its current form would create a level of business uncertainty that no company could accept."</p><p>Essentially, instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-paying-news-publishers-to-publish-ai-content">paying publishers for their content</a> as would be required by the JCPA, Google plans to stop linking to news sites that would be covered by the law. The company has outlined plans for similar laws and jurisdictions, such as Canada. To prepare for the implications of the JCPA, Google says it is conducting a limited test that removes links to California news sites. </p><p>Google also will pause investments in the California news ecosystem "until there&apos;s clarity on California&apos;s regulatory environment."</p><p>The bill&apos;s supporters want to help news publishers survive at a time when their content is often aggregated in search results or shared on social media. In these cases, news outlets may receive little or no compensation for their work. The JCPA would shift this model, forcing companies like Google and Meta to pay for links to certain news outlets.</p><p>“Google’s suppression today of California news demonstrates exactly why the California Legislature needs to pass legislation to rein in the tech colossus," said Charles Champion, the president and CEO of the California News Publishers Association, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/CNPAservices/status/1778910785651228701" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). "The fact that one company can shut down the means by which 90% of the public find online content in order to achieve their own political and business ends show just how much policymakers need to act, and act now."</p><p>Champion urged California lawmakers to look to examples of similar situations in Australia in Canada. Despite pushback, legislators in both countries proceeded with "link tax" laws, and Champion says "journalism jobs surged as a result."</p><p>Google uses information from news outlets and other sites in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-testing-four-featured-snippets">"featured snippets,"</a> which summarize the sites&apos; contents and disincentivize users from clicking through to the original source. In turn, this can cut out opportunities for news sites to earn through ad revenue. While we don&apos;t know exactly how much Google makes due to these practices, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24129986/paying-for-news.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> estimated the company owes publishers $10-12 billion annually. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It&apos;s that time of the year again when Google releases a new version of Android for testing. The first public beta of Android 15 is now available, and you can install the update on your Pixel if you&apos;re interested in taking an early look at all the features that are coming to Android this year. </p>
<p>But before you install the beta, there are a few things to be aware of. The first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta is still very buggy, so I wouldn&apos;t advice installing it on your daily driver. </p><p>If you&apos;ve got a spare Pixel lying around and want to take a look at Android 15 as it is today, then sure, scroll down below for instructions on how to install the beta. </p><p>Things should stabilize with Beta 2 or Beta 3 as Google works out the kinks, and I&apos;ll update this post after those builds go live. Google&apos;s beta release timeline hasn&apos;t changed, so the next build will be showing up in May. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="skASRE5PwdHQGoTTr98rLg" name="android-15-logo-hand.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/skASRE5PwdHQGoTTr98rLg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> was an iterative upgrade that didn&apos;t actually introduce a lot of new features, things are different with Android 15. Google is rolling out a ton of user-facing changes this time around, and that alone is cause for excitement. </p><p>Granted, most of these features are yet to go live, with Google instead focusing its attention on under-the-hood changes and other additions coming to Android 15. That said, if you&apos;re using Android 14 right now, there is a lot to like in Android 15. </p><p>With that out of the way, here&apos;s how to install the Android 15 beta.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-which-phones-can-download-the-android-15-beta"><span>Which phones can download the Android 15 Beta?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg" name="android-15-logo-devices.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this moment, the Android 15 beta is limited to Pixel devices starting from the Pixel 6. The list includes 10 devices in total: </p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li></ul>
<p>The Pixel 5 and 5a miss out on the beta, and for now, you can only install Android 15 on Google&apos;s own devices. That will change very soon as Google allows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> to get in on the action, and we&apos;re likely to see OPPO, Vivo, Realme, OnePlus, ASUS, and others join in on the action. We&apos;ll know more at I/O in May. </p>

<p>The easiest and simplest way to get the Android 15 beta is to enroll in the <strong>Android Beta Program</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply visit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">Android Beta portal</a>, where you&apos;ll be able to view all the devices eligible for the Android 15 beta. You can then opt-in to the beta, which will then prompt Google to send your phone or tablet an over-the-air update. You should then be able to install the update and restart your phone to make the switch to Android 15. </p>
<p>1. Head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"><strong>Android Beta program portal</strong></a> on your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Sign in to the <strong>Google account</strong> associated with that phone.</p><p>3. Scroll down to <strong>Your eligible devices</strong>.</p><p>4. Find the device you want to enroll in the <strong>Beta program</strong> and tap <strong>Opt-in</strong>.</p><p>5. Follow the prompts on your phone to accept the <strong>over-the-air download</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-want-to-leave-the-beta-program-2">What if I want to leave the beta program?</h2>

<p>You can easily opt out of the beta program by going to the same Android Beta portal as you did to enroll, scrolling down to your device, and selecting <strong>Opt out</strong>. But be warned; doing so will get rid of all the data on your phone.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://flash.android.com">Android Flash Tool</a>, a web-based version of the ADB developer tool, to install the Android 15 beta onto your phone.</p>
<p>1. Head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://flash.android.com"><strong>Android Flash Tool site</strong></a>.</p><p>2. Allow the site to <strong>access ADB</strong> in your browser.</p><p>3. Enable <strong>Developer Mode</strong> on your phone (tap Android build seven times).</p><p>4. <strong>Enable USB Debugging</strong> in the Developer Settings.</p><p>5. <strong>Enable OEM Unlocking</strong> on your device.</p><p>6. Plug in your phone to a <strong>USB port</strong> on your computer.</p><p>7. Select the device from the pop-up and <strong>follow the instructions</strong> to install the beta.</p>

<p>If you want to try Android 15 on your Pixel manually, you&apos;ll have to flash the OTA onto your Pixel. But before we get started, know that this method will involve deleting all data on your phone; if you don&apos;t want to do that, use the Flash Tool above and sideload the Android 15 beta instead.  </p><p>Before you start doing this, make sure that no OTA updates are yet to be installed on your Pixel. Go to <strong>Settings > About phone > System updates</strong> and see no pending updates. Also, ensure that you have <strong>USB debugging</strong> enabled on your phone.</p>
<p>To get started, head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/download-ota">Android 15 OTA images page</a>, and download the relevant build for your Pixel. To sideload the build onto your Pixel, you&apos;ll need to use ADB — I&apos;m a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://adb.clockworkmod.com/">Universal ADB Drivers</a>. Once installed on your Windows machine and the OTA image has been downloaded, you can start sideloading the build.</p>
<p>You&apos;ll first need to put your phone in recovery mode. You can power off and then <strong>hold the Power button</strong> along with the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button for a few seconds to enter the bootloader menu and select the recovery option using the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button.</p>
<p>Here, you should see the Android mascot face down with an exclamation mark over it. Hold down the <strong>Power button</strong> and press <strong>Volume Up</strong> once to enter recovery mode. Next, navigate to the option that says <strong>Apply update from ADB</strong> by using the <strong>Volume Up</strong> button and confirm the selection by pressing the <strong>Power button</strong> once.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to sideload the OTA image. Confirm that your phone can connect to your computer and is detectable. For this, plug your Pixel into your computer and run this command:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code>adb devices</code></pre>
<p>You should see your phone&apos;s serial number and <strong>sideload</strong> next to it. Now we can get to flashing the OTA build; just run this in CMD:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code>adb sideload ota_file.zip</code></pre>
<p>Here, you will need to switch out <strong>ota_file.zip</strong> with the filename of the OTA build for your particular device. I&apos;m installing Android 15 on a Pixel 8, so I entered the following: <strong>shiba_beta-ota-ap31.240322.018-236bea75.zip</strong> into CMD. For this to work, make sure that the OTA file is in the same directory as the CMD path.</p>
<p>Once the OTA file is transferred to your phone, it should go back to the recovery menu. Navigate to <strong>Reboot system now</strong> and confirm with the <strong>Power</strong> button to restart your phone. The OTA update will be installed and your phone will switch to Android 15 without losing any data.</p>

<p>We&apos;re just getting started with Android 15, and we should see more feature additions as we get closer to the stable build. Like previous years, the Android 15 beta program will include four beta builds, with the second rolling out shortly in May. The June build — Android 15 Beta 3 — should be stable as Google rolls out a slew of bug fixes based on feedback from earlier beta versions. </p>

The brand now focuses on two distinct product lines, with the Zenfone series catered to mainstream users looking for a phone with high-end hardware, and then there&apos;s the ROG Phone series that offers aggressive designs backed by the latest hardware and a host of extras. Here&apos;s what you need to know about the best ASUS phones available right now.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Best of both worlds</strong></em></p>
<p>The Zenfone 11 Ultra has terrific hardware that easily holds its own against the best phones available today, and you get clean software with zero bloatware and a refined interface. The cameras aren't quite on the same level as the Pixel 8 Pro or Galaxy S24 Ultra, but if you want a larger ASUS phone, the Zenfone 11 Ultra is an easy recommendation. </p></p>

<p>The ROG Phone 8 Pro is an incredible gaming phone, but it doesn't have the same aggressive design that sets earlier devices apart. You instead have a much more streamlined design that looks good in its own right, but ASUS didn't omit any of the gaming extras. If you need a phone to play games on Android, the ROG Phone 8 Pro is the best of the lot. </p></p>

<p>The Zenfone 10 is a subtle upgrade over the Zenfone 9, but you still get the same great in-hand feel. There isn't another phone that gives you the same set of great features in such a small size, and if you need a small phone, the Zenfone 10 is the way to go. </p></p>

<p>The ROG Phone 7 Ultimate is still an outstanding gaming phone, featuring a large AMOLED screen that goes up to an insane 165Hz, liquid-cooled hardware that's phenomenal, and a 6000mAh battery. The phone has bold styling, a second screen at the back that can be customized with various effects, ultrasonic triggers on the sides that you can use with in-game actions, and a side-mounted USB-C port.</p></p>

<p>The ROG Phone 7 retains the best features of the ROG Phone 7 Pro, and the only difference is that the design isn't quite the same, and the second screen at the back doesn't have as much utility. That said, it is much more affordable. </p></p>

<p>The ROG Phone 6D Ultimate is nearly identical to the ROG Phone 6 Pro, but there are a few key differences. It is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9000+, and it has a vent that opens to allow cool air to flow into the chassis. It comes with ASUS's AeroActive Cooler bundled in the box, and while it isn't officially available in North America, you can get it in other global markets.</p></p>

<h2 id="if-you-want-the-best-asus-phone-get-the-zenfone-11-ultra-2">If you want the best ASUS phone, get the Zenfone 11 Ultra</h2>
<p>With ASUS now focusing on two distinct product lines, it doesn&apos;t make as many phones as it used to. That said, this condensed strategy is working well for the brand, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> is a great overall product that nails the basics. It isn&apos;t a small phone like its predecessors, but it has the right balance between hardware optimization and clean software, and the larger size allows it to stand out. </p><p>Of course, if you need a small phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a> is still the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phone</a> you can get today. Right now, there isn&apos;t another device that has the same caliber of hardware as the Zenfone 10 in such a small size, and that alone makes it worthy of consideration. </p>
<p>If you want something aimed at gaming, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8 Pro</a> delivers outstanding hardware backed by a whole suite of gaming-focused features. The phone isn&apos;t as aggressive when it comes to styling, and that is a smart move by ASUS as it allows the device to be much more palatable by a mainstream audience. That said, you don&apos;t miss out on any of the gaming extras, and it is a real joy to use. </p>

UWB can be used as a virtual car key for select BMW models, and the tech sits at the heart of Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">SmartTag+</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ultra-wideband-2">What is ultra-wideband?</h2>
<p>Think of ultra-wideband (UWB) as a turbocharged verison of Bluetooth. The Bluetooth LE (low energy) standard isn&apos;t ideal for location sensing because of the latency — which is usually over 3ms — but with UWB, that is brought down to under 1ms. UWB also has over three times the range of Bluetooth, and can transmit over 20 times the amount of data.</p>
<p>UWB has significant advantages over Bluetooth because it works at a higher frequency — the pulse-based technology uses spectrum from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz. It also uses wider 500MHz channels to transmit data (Bluetooth is usually limited to 20MHz) and this allows the standard to send or receive a burst of data in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>UWB is an emerging standard, and as such it is limited to flagships. Apple, Google, and Samsung are the three brands that offer it on their flagships, so if you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, you will be able to use the radio to unlock additional features. </p><p>Auto manufacturers are embracing the standard as an easy way to unlock cars, with the likes of BMW, Audi, Ford, and others rolling out UWB compatibility to their latest models. So if you have a phone with UWB, you can use it to unlock your car. </p>
<p>Samsung&apos;s SmartTag+ is a UWB-based tracker that delivers much better range and accuracy than the standard SmartTag, which still relies on Bluetooth. </p>
<h2 id="which-samsung-phones-have-uwb-2">Which Samsung phones have UWB?</h2>
<p>Samsung started integrating UWB into its flagships with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra back in 2020, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> include the feature as standard. </p>
<p>That said, Samsung is picky about what models get UWB connectivity; the standard model in its Galaxy S series misses out on the feature, and it is limited to the Plus and Ultra models. </p>

<p>In addition to phones, UWB tech is slowly making its way to connected devices and earbuds, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a> featuring the tech.

OnePlus isn&apos;t making too many changes with the Nord CE4; the phone has the same 120Hz screen, but it has a bit more power thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, a larger battery with 100W charging, and a new 50MP camera at the back.</p><p>However, the Nord CE4 has inherent limitations; the phone will get just two Android platform updates, there&apos;s no alert slider, and the cameras don&apos;t do a passable job when it comes to shooting videos. With Nothing setting the bar high in this segment thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, OnePlus had to deliver the best possible device to be able to measure up.</p><p>But it hasn&apos;t done that. The Chinese manufacturer instead focused on iterative upgrades without addressing key shortcomings of the Nord CE series, and in doing so, it made the CE4 a poor overall choice in this segment.</p>

<p>OnePlus unveiled the Nord CE4 in India on April 1, and the phone is now available for sale in the country. The phone is sold in Celadon Marble (the model I&apos;m using) and Dark Chrome color variants, and it retails for ₹24,999 ($300). That&apos;s for the variant that has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and if you need more storage, there&apos;s an 8GB/256GB version that&apos;s available for ₹26,999 ($324).</p><p>OnePlus has a few launch incentives that discount the phone by up to ₹1,500 ($18) with select cards, and you can get an additional ₹2,500 ($30) off by exchanging your current phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UKWfx9eVakmvogkVAE4g5Q" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UKWfx9eVakmvogkVAE4g5Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus likes to switch up the design of Nord CE phones with every generation, and that&apos;s the case with the CE4 as well. The phone doesn&apos;t have many similarities to the Nord CE3, with OnePlus now offering an oblong camera housing that looks a lot cleaner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4YzwYwTmS8garg7EfRVZHQ" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-11.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YzwYwTmS8garg7EfRVZHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The choice of color is interesting as well; the Celadon Marble variant has a distinctive pattern at the back that stands out, and while the hue isn&apos;t as vibrant, it evokes similarities to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-marble-odyssey-hands-on">OnePlus 11 Marble Odyssey</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. The back has a glossy finish and is prone to picking up smudges, and it has a subtle curve where the back meets the mid-frame.</p>
<p>The back and mid-frame are made out of polycarbonate, and I have no problems with that. The phone has flat sides, but you get beveled edges that make holding and using it a little easier. There&apos;s also an IR blaster and MicroSD slot, so if you need to extend storage the old-fashioned way, you can do that with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXsVFueir4J5T4YTWgAU6T" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXsVFueir4J5T4YTWgAU6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think the design looks fresh and elegant — particularly with the Celadon Marble version — and the addition of IP54 ingress protection makes the Nord CE4 that much more resilient to the elements. Another intriguing feature that made its way from the OnePlus 12/12R is the Aqua Touch tech that lets you use the device with wet fingers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TbzQWbBRyrmta6ehXswvVR" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbzQWbBRyrmta6ehXswvVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the panel, the Nord CE4 has the same 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen as last year, and it is serviceable. You can set the refresh rate to 60Hz or 120Hz, and there&apos;s an auto mode that changes it on the fly. OnePlus is using a custom Panda Glass solution instead of the standard Gorilla Glass over the screen, and while the manufacturer says the phone is able to withstand a tumble from 1.5 meters, I didn&apos;t put that to the test.</p>

<p>As for the hardware, the Nord CE4 is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3; it uses the new Cortex A715 and A510 cores and is built on a 4nm node. You get 8GB of RAM as standard, and the base model has 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage, with the 256GB variant also offering UFS 3.1. The Nord CE3 had 12GB of RAM with the 256GB model, but the CE4 is limited to 8GB across the board. That said, more RAM doesn&apos;t really make a difference, and 8GB is adequate in this scenario.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EcD6TfdEwQx8n2urHrjbmR" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-14.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EcD6TfdEwQx8n2urHrjbmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone doesn&apos;t have noticeable lag in daily use, and it does a decent enough job when it comes to gaming — provided you stick to casual games. I didn&apos;t see any issues with overheating or while making calls and in general daily usage situations, and the Nord CE4 proved to be reliable. The device has Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, and the usual AptX HD codec.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7p2yaLfppCSLBESYT6bAiS" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7p2yaLfppCSLBESYT6bAiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest change with the Nord CE4 is the battery — the phone now has a 5500mAh battery, and there&apos;s 100W charging. It takes just over 30 minutes to fully charge the battery, and there really isn&apos;t another device in this segment that comes close to the Nord CE4 in this regard. Battery life is outstanding as well, and I easily got a day and a half between charges.</p>

<p>Cameras continue to be a big differentiator in this category, and the Nord CE4 uses a new 50MP Sony LYT600 sensor with OIS. That&apos;s joined by an 8MP wide-angle lens that features the Sony IMX355, and at the front, you get a 16MP module.</p>

<p>The camera takes good photos in most situations, and I don&apos;t have any problems in this regard. Daylight photos have good detail rendition and dynamic range, and the device is able to lock in on a subject with ease, and maintain focus. The camera does a decent job in low-light scenarios as well, and while there is some noise, you get good details and colors.</p>

<p>On the software side of things, you get the same ColorOS 14 interface based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> as other OnePlus phones, and there isn&apos;t much to talk about. The UI is modern and has a few Material You-based options that allow you to customize accent colors to your preferences, and there is no shortage of customizability.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-nord-ce4-what-i-don-t-like"><span>OnePlus Nord CE4: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZujpyJZfrAEuaWwgwc9tST" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZujpyJZfrAEuaWwgwc9tST.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design is good, the Nord CE4 doesn&apos;t quite have the same in-hand feel as other devices in this segment; the edges tend to dig into the palm, and that makes using the phone without a case mildly annoying. Then there&apos;s the fact that you miss out on the alert slider — even OPPO phones now have the slider, so I don&apos;t understand why OnePlus can&apos;t be bothered to add the feature to its devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="inBYhd3NhttZpjcKig7hfQ" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/inBYhd3NhttZpjcKig7hfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are issues with the screen as well; colors have a distinct cooler tone that is evident when streaming videos on the device. Switching to the Natural mode makes a difference, but even then the color balance isn&apos;t dialed in, and I had to adjust the slider all the way to the warm end of the scale to get realistic colors. I didn&apos;t see issues with brightness, but the phone doesn&apos;t get as bright as its rivals — the Phone 2a was much better in outdoor use.</p>
<p>All games are locked to 60fps, and this is a limitation within ColorOS, so regardless of what OnePlus device you&apos;re using, you won&apos;t be able to play high refresh rate titles. So even though you get playable framerates in casual titles, the Adreno 720 isn&apos;t able to handle demanding games, and there is noticeable jitter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PzFD5UCzTWzpQPbrh5B86S" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PzFD5UCzTWzpQPbrh5B86S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 2a does a much better job in this area, and even though it doesn&apos;t have hardware that&apos;s significantly more powerful than what you&apos;re getting here, Nothing&apos;s optimization makes all the difference. And on the subject of hardware, you don&apos;t get NFC; I still don&apos;t get why phone manufacturers omit the feature on their devices, but if you need the radio, you&apos;ll need to get the Nord 3.</p>
<p>It&apos;s good to see OnePlus not bothering with useless sensors like the 2MP macro lens that was a mainstay on its devices, but the downside is that it doesn&apos;t offer a way to shoot macro photos at all. Most brands let you use the main camera or the wide-angle lens to shoot macro shots, but OnePlus hasn&apos;t bothered to do so here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BSQxeF3wKswpdDHAYY3EtQ" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BSQxeF3wKswpdDHAYY3EtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the wide-angle lens isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the main camera, and it barely delivers passable shots in low-light situations. Video recording is similarly hobbled, and videos taken in daylight are grainy and don&apos;t have much in the way of detail.</p>
<p>But the biggest limitation with the Nord CE4 is the software. OnePlus guarantees just two platform updates with the phone, and that is not enough in 2024. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a> get four updates as standard, and other devices in this segment now offer three Android OS updates, and that puts the Nord CE4 on the backfoot.</p>

<p>If you want the best phone that this segment has to offer, you need to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>. The device has a much more interesting design with LED lights at the back, the software is clean, uncluttered, fluid, and doesn&apos;t have any bloatware. You also get more software updates, the hardware is optimized like no other budget phone, and there are two usable cameras at the back.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x6-pro-review">POCO X6 Pro</a> is a great choice if you want the best hardware. I like the design of the X6 Pro — particularly in yellow — the panel gets brighter, you get UFS 4.0 storage, NFC, and the Dimensity 8300 Ultra is great at playing demanding games. The software isn&apos;t uncluttered, but it is fluid, and you get three platform updates.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-nord-ce4-should-you-buy-it"><span>OnePlus Nord CE4: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="auw6BUZuBwi9Q9YZBUyKeP" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/auw6BUZuBwi9Q9YZBUyKeP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a phone with 100W charging</li><li>You need a MicroSD card slot</li><li>You want a good camera at the back</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a budget phone with the best hardware</li><li>You need clean software</li><li>You want long-term software updates</li><li>You need usable auxiliary cameras</li></ul>
<p>The Nord CE4 has a few things going for it; the phone has the best battery life of any budget phone I tested this year, and the camera holds its own against its rivals. But the rest of the package is lackluster to say the least. OnePlus should have put in more effort to differentiate the phone, because as it stands, I don&apos;t see any reason to recommend it.</p><p>The hardware isn&apos;t the best in this segment, the lack of NFC is irksome, the wide-angle camera doesn&apos;t measure up to the main lens, and there&apos;s no alert slider. But it&apos;s the update policy that ultimately hinders the Nord CE4 — two platform updates are just not good enough anymore, particularly when immediate rivals like the Phone 2a and X6 Pro guarantee three updates as standard.</p><p>OnePlus says the Nord CE series is all about delivering the core essentials that users need, and if that is indeed the case, the company should have thought of adding features that its customers actually care about, like long-term updates and optimized hardware.</p>

<p>For years, one of the best features for Android users has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9075927?hl=en">Smart Lock</a>. In 2023, Google began rebranding the feature, as it&apos;s now called "Extend Unlock." When it comes to functionality, there isn&apos;t a difference between the two, but the same can&apos;t be said when compared to Watch Unlock.</p><p>Extend Unlock relies on one of three different requirements for your phone to remain unlocked. These include On-body detection, Trusted Places, and Trusted devices. The first two are pretty self-explanatory; however, Trusted devices might seem a little redundant. </p><p>While that&apos;s technically true, the reality is that Watch Unlock is a more secure solution. In order for Extend Unlock with Trusted devices to work, the only requirement is that your smartwatch is connected and within Bluetooth range. Provided that&apos;s the case, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> will remain unlocked for up to four hours. </p><p>As for Watch Unlock, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13387340?hl=en">Google states</a> that "your watch must be on" and "paired to your phone&apos;s Bluetooth." In order to bolster security, your phone <em>must</em> have a passcode or have biometrics set up. Otherwise, you won&apos;t be able to set up or use Watch Unlock with your devices.</p>

<p>Even though some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> already offer similar functionality, it&apos;s still interesting to see what Google is bringing to Wear OS. And, if rumors are to be believed, Watch Unlock could soon be in store for an upgrade. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-plans-to-give-watch-unlock-a-boost-with-ultra-wideband-tech">it was discovered</a> that Google is working on relying on ultra-wideband (UWB) connectivity as opposed to Bluetooth. </p><p>In doing so, this aims to improve the speed and reliability of a feature such as Watch Unlock. However, at the time of this writing, neither the Pixel Watch nor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> supports UWB. This means that we&apos;ll have to wait to see if a UWB chip is integrated into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>. </p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 8a recently appeared on the UScellular website ahead of the expected launch.</li><li>The device has been listed on the carrier's "Device Tutorials" listing.</li><li>The listing reveals the device's design, which is very similar to the previous leaked renders.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After seeing the upcoming Pixel 8a appear in a new Mint color, another leak gives away the device&apos;s manual and tutorials.</p><p>The Pixel 8a was spotted by Evan Blass on the UScellular&apos;s Device Tutorials&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uscellular.com/support/device-tutorials?page=device/google/pixel-8a">support page</a>, showcasing the front pane of the mid-range device alongside several how-to&apos;s related to the next Google handset, which is expected to be unveiled at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a>. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So it's about 1AM early Saturday morning at Google HQ. How long will it take the right person to notice this and reach out to someone at the carrier, who will then presumably need to ping yet a third individual at the vendor responsible for posting (and removing) these tutorials? pic.twitter.com/4neK48wGUZ<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1779060659247849549">April 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The listing also showcases the device&apos;s front panel, which looks much more familiar than the renders we have seen earlier — a punch-hole display and more rounded corners than its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>.</p><p>The listing showcases tutorials like downloading and installing apps, pairing a device through Bluetooth, resetting and restarting the phone, etc.</p><p>For example, the "Enable Fingerprint Security" tutorial confirms that the device will be sporting Face Unlock next to the traditional biometrics. Aside from such nifty features, the listing hasn&apos;t revealed concrete specs about the device yet.</p>
<p>With the listing spotted on a US-based carrier site, the launch seems imminent at Google I/O 2024, which is a couple of weeks away. The recent Mint variant is spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-google-pixel-8a-renders-reveal-color-options">recent renders</a> next to the conventional obsidian, porcelain, and bay colorways.</p><p>The Pixel 8a will be the toned-down version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series from last year, which is expected to be powered by the same Tensor G3 SoC underneath. At least one of the prominent cameras from the flagship Pixel will also likely be carried to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>Earlier rumors have also hinted at a 6.1-inch screen featuring a 90Hz to 120Hz refresh rate on the Pixel 8a. Other reports have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-a-bigger-battery">indicated</a> that we could see a bigger battery capacity despite the device being tailored to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a> segment.</p>

<ul><li>A new Instant Replay feature is now available in Horizon Worlds, letting players instantly save gameplay footage.</li><li>Instant Replay automatically saves "select gameplay moments" in supported worlds, sending them to the Meta Quest app gallery for review when they occur.</li><li>Meta is also testing a new "Frame Budget Boost" feature to boost performance in Horizon Worlds.</li></ul>
<p>Every gamer has had a "did you see that?" moment. On consoles like the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch, players just have to long-press the share button and the last 30 seconds (or more) of gameplay will be saved, making it easy to share those moments with friends. Now, Meta is testing a similar feature in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/horizon-worlds-explained">Horizon Worlds</a> social app so gamers can spend more time playing and less time recording.</p><p>Meta calls the feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/quest/meta-horizon-worlds-v157-release-notes/">Instant Replay</a> and it automatically saves "select moments" from a world when set up by the world&apos;s creator. When these moments are captured, they&apos;re automatically sent to the gallery on your headset — also accessible via the Meta Quest smartphone app — where you can review and choose if you want to share them.</p><p>In Horizon Worlds, any world that supports the new feature will have a new camera icon on the world page. You&apos;ll also receive a notification of the supporting feature on your headset when you enter a world that supports Instant Replay. Meta allows players to disable the feature by heading to Settings, General, then Selecting “Off” for Instant Replay in the Horizon Worlds app.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Meta to find out if Instant Replay could appear in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>Over the years, Meta has significantly improved the gameplay capture experience on Meta Quest headsets. Capturing used to be low resolution and unreliable on the original Oculus Quest but that was improved on the Meta Quest 2. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> launched with an option to record gameplay in 16:9 1080p quality.</p><p>Late last year, Meta released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-quest-pc-casting-2-0-uncropped-widescreen/">Casting 2.0 for developers</a> which allowed ultrawide video capture at the expense of some capture performance. This mode is only available in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh/">Meta Quest Developer Hub</a>. Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2k4cCNG_7s">some tutorials exist</a> to make it relatively easy to get started.</p><p>An automatic capturing feature would be the best new addition yet, as it would mean players wouldn&apos;t need to manually start a recording before beginning their gameplay session.</p><p>In addition to Instant Replay, Meta is testing out a new "Frame Budget Boost" feature that will be enabled for all worlds automatically and can improve performance in some situations. Meta encourages world creators to review the new tool and see if it makes sense to keep enabled for their worlds.</p><p>All of this is part of Meta&apos;s push to make Horizon Worlds more accessible and available. The company began expanding Horizon Worlds beyond VR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/horizon-worlds-web-mobile-social-vr-free/">last Fall</a>, and better performance and automatic capture features could help propel the game&apos;s popularity among similar apps like Rec Room and Roblox.</p>

Most Wear OS watches require a full charge every day or so, while light use might get you through two full days.</p><p>The introduction of dual architecture designs, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, will certainly change this conversation going forward, but for the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, we&apos;ve got some tips and tricks that&apos;ll help extend battery life when you need your watch to stay around for a few hours longer until you can make it to a charger.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-switch-to-battery-saver-mode"><span>Switch to battery saver mode</span></h2>
<p>All Wear OS watches have some kind of battery saver mode, whether it&apos;s the Google Pixel Watch series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a> series, or one of the many excellent companies making other Wear OS watches. Battery saver will automatically turn off things like the always on display, disable the tilt to wake functionality, and sometimes turn off other sensors to keep the watch in deep sleep for longer.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do it on a Google Pixel Watch or other watches that use the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>battery icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Confirm that you want to <strong>enable </strong>battery saver mode.</p><p>To turn it off, follow steps one and two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="szYVxdNG72yT3fmsZ782VV" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-battery-saver-mode.jpg" alt="Turning on battery saver mode on a Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szYVxdNG72yT3fmsZ782VV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="542" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here&apos;s how to enable battery saver mode on a Samsung Galaxy Watch:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Swipe <strong>over one page</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>battery icon </strong>with the recycle symbol inside.</p><p>4. Confirm that you want to <strong>enable </strong>battery saver mode.</p><p>To turn it off, follow the steps again.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t worry too much about this mode, as you should still be able to take advantage of many features of your watch, such as automatic workout tracking, although that also depends on your preferences. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fossil-smartwatch">Fossil smartwatches</a>, for example, allow you to customize your battery save mode.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-off-hey-google-hotword-detection"><span>Turn off "Hey Google" hotword detection</span></h2>
<p>While it can be convenient to use your watch hands-free by just saying the words "hey Google," this feature can be a real battery drain. Since the watch is listening for the keywords at all hours of the day, the low-power processor is always sipping from the battery.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to turn it off on all Wear OS watches:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>Google</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Assistant</strong>.</p><p>5. Disable <strong>"Hey Google"</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:813px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="qrvzMSBPYWij7rVCPU637F" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-hey-google.jpg" alt="How to disable Hey Google on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qrvzMSBPYWij7rVCPU637F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="813" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even without the hotword on, you&apos;ll still be able to call up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> with whatever shortcut you have set on your smartwatch.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-always-on-display"><span>Disable always-on display</span></h2>
<p>Having an always-on display can look super cool on a smartwatch, but it also can cause screen burn-in and drains your smartwatch battery quicker. Battery saver mode will turn this off automatically, but we recommend keeping it off all the time if you&apos;re looking for the best battery life and screen health.</p><p>The process is the same on all Wear OS watches:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Display</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down to and <strong>disable always-on-display</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:813px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="ZtFBkjQXAxZsC7Qqo9qjcE" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-always-on-display.jpg" alt="How to disable the always-on display on the Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZtFBkjQXAxZsC7Qqo9qjcE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="813" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even without the AOD on, you can still enable features like gestures to turn the display on when your wrist faces upwards, although that may also drain more battery than manually turning it on with a button. Thus, you may also want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#section-disable-raise-to-wake">turn off raise to wake</a>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reduce-screen-brightness"><span>Reduce screen brightness</span></h2>
<p>Modern Wear OS watches have automatic brightness sensors, but you can still let your watch know that you&apos;re comfortable with a lower average brightness level. That means your watch will still get brighter when it needs to — like in direct sunlight — but it&apos;ll try to prioritize lower brightness levels when you&apos;re indoors or in dark areas.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to adjust the brightness level on a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>brightness icon</strong>. It looks like a Sun.</p><p>3. Reduce the brightness by tapping the <strong>minus icon</strong>.</p><p>4. For further battery savings, turn off <strong>Adaptive Brightness</strong> and leave the brightness at minimum.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="WV6viVzYDa9ZCbberEPTWC" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-brightness-adjustment.jpg" alt="How to adjust brightness on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WV6viVzYDa9ZCbberEPTWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="542" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The benefit here is obvious, although smartwatches are coming with brighter and brighter screens each year for better outdoor visibility, which is important for fitness enthusiasts who tend to use their wearables outdoors while exercising. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-raise-to-wake"><span>Disable raise to wake</span></h2>
<p>Raise to wake is a great alternative to having an always-on display, as it makes it effortless to raise your arm and see your watch display. But, like the always-on display, this one can drain the battery as it&apos;s always monitoring your wrist movements to ensure it turns the display on at the right time. Disabling this gesture will improve battery life.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do it on a Google Pixel Watch or other watches that use the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>gestures</strong>.</p><p>4. Disable <strong>raise-to-wake or tilt-to-wake</strong>. The wording depends on the watch you&apos;re wearing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="NvWTfNPHgxcAL6wTLmRkeK" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-tilt-to-wake.jpg" alt="How to disable tilt-to-wake on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvWTfNPHgxcAL6wTLmRkeK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="542" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s how to do it on a Samsung Galaxy Watch:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>display</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down and disable <strong>Raise to wake</strong>.</p>
<p>Without raise to wake, you&apos;ll still be able to turn on the display by tapping it or pressing any button on your smartwatch.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-lower-screen-timeout-duration"><span>Lower screen timeout duration</span></h2>
<p>Most of the time when you look at your watch, you only need to glance at information for a second or two. By default, most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> will keep the screen on for 15 seconds at a time but this value can be lowered for extra battery savings. Here&apos;s how to adjust that.</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>display</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down to and select <strong>screen timeout</strong>.</p><p>5. Pick a <strong>lower screen timeout value</strong>, such as 10 seconds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:813px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="cqc7SQ3DRvrZoco98iBVVU" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-screen-timeout.jpg" alt="How to adjust screen timeout on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqc7SQ3DRvrZoco98iBVVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="813" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is not all that different from a smartphone, although given the limited engagement with a smartwatch, reducing the timeout may not prove to be as bothersome.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-off-sunlight-boost"><span>Turn off sunlight boost</span></h2>
<p>As you might expect, Wear OS watches with the Sunlight Boost feature allow the display to temporarily get brighter when in direct sunlight. This feature uses the auto brightness sensor to activate but will drain the battery faster, especially if you spend a lot of time outdoors.</p><p>Not all watches have this feature, but here&apos;s how to disable it on watches that do.</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>display</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Sunlight Boost</strong>.</p><p>5. <strong>Disable</strong> the feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:813px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="DmJLifXa9FE7yUA8vkC62E" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-sunlight-boost.jpg" alt="How to disable sunlight boost on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DmJLifXa9FE7yUA8vkC62E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="813" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, the benefit of a feature like this is invaluable to users that find themselves utilizing their wearables outdoors much of the time, especially while out on hikes and the like. In such circumstances, it may be helpful to turn on this feature, unless you absolutely need to conserve battery.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reduce-or-disable-vibration"><span>Reduce or disable vibration</span></h2>
<p>Having your watch vibrate when a notification or call comes through can be extremely handy, but that little vibration motor can sap a lot of battery if it&apos;s being used all day long. If this is a must-have feature, you might want to consider reducing vibration intensity which will help prolong the battery life of your watch.</p><p>Otherwise, if your watch makes noise with a notification or a call and you don&apos;t feel like you need the vibration feature, you can turn it off entirely.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do that on a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>vibration</strong>.</p><p>4. If you want to disable vibration entirely, <strong>disable vibration & haptics</strong>.</p><p>5. Otherwise, scroll down to the individual sections and <strong>reduce vibration </strong>for calls, notifications, and other categories.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:813px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="iqGiZVJSDSJKyGhLiedFGh" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-vibration.jpg" alt="How to reduce or disable vibration on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iqGiZVJSDSJKyGhLiedFGh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="813" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On a Samsung Galaxy Watch, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down and tap <strong>Sounds and vibration</strong>.</p><p>4. If you want to disable vibration entirely, tap <strong>Mute</strong>.</p><p>5. Otherwise, scroll down to the <strong>individual sections </strong>for Vibration, Call vibration, Notification vibration, and System vibration.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-only-enable-notifications-for-a-few-apps"><span>Only enable notifications for a few apps</span></h2>
<p>This step is best done on the watch app on your smartphone. By default, most Wear OS watches will display notifications for any app you have installed on your smartphone. If you&apos;re getting too many useless notifications, your watch&apos;s battery life will be reduced for no good reason.</p><p>Instead, be a little more choosy about which apps give you notifications on your watch and you&apos;ll likely be pleasantly surprised at how much better battery life can be. This step is very dependent on the app that your watch uses since each company has to use its own app for Wear OS 3 and beyond.</p><p>Here are the steps for the Google Pixel Watch:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>the Watch app</strong> on your smartphone. It&apos;s called Watch.</p><p>2. Select <strong>notifications</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll through the list and <strong>deselect apps </strong>for which you don&apos;t want to receive notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.80%;"><img id="m2NXNbY9ioqRUZgjsJ5QAK" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-phone-app-notifications.jpg" alt="Changing notifications in the Wear OS app for the Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2NXNbY9ioqRUZgjsJ5QAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, you can automatically deny notifications for new apps by disabling the "<strong>allow new app notifications</strong>" feature. That way you&apos;ll have to manually enable notifications for any new apps.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Watch users should follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Galaxy Wearable </strong>app on your smartphone.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Watch Settings</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>App notifications</strong>.</p><p>5. Scroll through the list and <strong>deselect apps </strong>you don&apos;t want to receive notifications for.</p><p>6. Go back to the <strong>previous screen</strong>.</p><p>7. Select <strong>Advanced notification settings</strong>.</p><p>8. Disable any <strong>applicable options </strong>such as Turn on screen and Auto turn on watch notifications for new phone apps.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-unused-radios"><span>Disable unused radios</span></h2>
<p>A smartwatch is as much a communication device as it is a watch, but not every radio needs to be enabled all the time. If you&apos;ve got a watch capable of LTE or 5G connectivity, turning off that radio when it&apos;s not needed will <em>substantially</em> improve battery life. Disabling Wi-Fi can further help battery life if you&apos;ve always got your phone tagging alongside your watch, as well.</p><p>In addition to that, you can turn off the NFC radio if you have no plans to use Google Pay or another type of tap-to-pay app on your watch.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do it on a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Connectivity </strong>or <strong>Connections.</strong></p><p>4. Tap <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.</p><p>5. <strong>Turn off </strong>Wi-Fi.</p><p>6. Swipe from the left to <strong>go back</strong> to connectivity.</p><p>7. Tap <strong>NFC</strong>.</p><p>8. <strong>Disable </strong>NFC.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-a-battery-efficient-watch-face"><span>Use a battery-efficient watch face</span></h2>
<p>You can find an unlimited number of watch faces to customize your smartwatch to your liking but, until developers get on board with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">new Watch Face Format</a> from Google, many of them could be draining your battery needlessly.</p><p>Using the built-in watch faces that ship with your watch will give you the best result, but some of those can be boring. If you&apos;re looking at a third party watch face store like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeremysteckling.facerrel">Facer</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pujie.wristwear.pujieblack">Pujie</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=slide.watchFrenzy">Watch Maker</a>, look for faces with the following qualities:</p>
<p>- <strong>Lots of black space</strong>. OLED display pixels are completely off when pure black is displayed. More black pixels = more battery savings.</p><p>- <strong>Fewer animations</strong>. Watches with lots of animations needlessly use CPU power and drain battery.</p><p>- <strong>No built-in apps</strong>. Some watch faces have features like a built-in calculator or calendar. These are handy but can drain your watch&apos;s battery as if you were running an app all the time.</p><p>- <strong>Lower weather refresh rate</strong>. Some watch faces offer weather services that can drain your battery by checking for updates too often. Choose watch faces that use Wear OS&apos;s built-in weather service, instead.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-bedtime-mode-or-turn-off-at-night"><span>Use bedtime mode or turn off at night</span></h2>
<p>If you like to wear your watch to bed to track your sleep, it&apos;s important that you activate bedtime mode before you lay your head on the pillow. Otherwise, your watch&apos;s display might turn on every time you toss and turn, wasting precious battery while it&apos;s trying to track your sleep.</p><p>On a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI, here&apos;s how to do it:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>bedtime icon</strong>. It looks like a crescent moon with stars.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>checkmark </strong>to turn on bedtime mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:271px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="xzDjsty4iH68oy8hEYUJNc" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-bedtime.jpg" alt="How to start bedtime mode on the Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xzDjsty4iH68oy8hEYUJNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="271" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here&apos;s how to activate bedtime mode on a Samsung Galaxy Watch:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>modes button</strong>. It looks like a checkmark with an arrow circling around it.</p><p>3. Select <strong>sleep</strong> from the list.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="QPYTSTEcMPfZtmdABBN9GX" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-screenshots-sleep-mode.jpg" alt="How to turn on sleep mode on a Samsung Galaxy Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QPYTSTEcMPfZtmdABBN9GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Otherwise, if you&apos;re like me and don&apos;t like wearing your watch to sleep, just turn it off at night. <strong>Press and hold the crown</strong> until the power menu appears, then select power off.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-off-location-tracking"><span>Turn off location tracking</span></h2>
<p>A watch that&apos;s constantly checking for your location could create an obvious drain on your battery, but turning off location tracking should only be a last resort battery-saving measure. If you turn location off on your watch, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/find/">Find My Device</a> feature won&apos;t work. That means it won&apos;t be easy to locate your watch if you ever lose it.</p><p>Additionally, turning location services off will result in some features not working properly. You won&apos;t be able to get weather results based on current location, and Google Maps and other similar location-based services likely won&apos;t work at all.</p><p>If you&apos;re not worried about that, here&apos;s how to disable location tracking:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>location</strong>.</p><p>4. <strong>Disable</strong> location.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="nwrHf2myRChJCeAjJdUtUJ" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-location.jpg" alt="How to disable location tracking on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwrHf2myRChJCeAjJdUtUJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="542" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you have a Galaxy smartphone, you can also tap the location toggle in Quick Settings to turn the feature on or off in an instant.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-check-for-rogue-apps"><span>Check for rogue apps</span></h2>
<p>Last but not least, if you&apos;re still experiencing poor battery life after trying any of the above steps, your real problem could lie in a rogue app. Every so often, an app will get stuck running in the background, causing heavy battery drain. This can happen on any computer or mobile device, but there are ways to detect it on some smartwatches.</p><p>Unfortunately, Pixel Watch owners don&apos;t have a good way to do this. The Samsung Galaxy Watch does, though, and here&apos;s how you can find it:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>Battery and device care</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Battery</strong>.</p><p>5. Tap the <strong>battery life bar</strong> at the top.</p><p>6. <strong>Scroll through the list</strong> to identify apps using lots of battery. The heaviest use apps and features are located at the top of the list.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>WearOS and WatchOS have a couple dozen smartwatch games apiece, with a cult following of gamers who like puzzles and arcade games on tiny screens. However, one type of game would go with smartwatches like PB&J: a virtual pet watch face/ game, like the Tamagotchi or Pikachu wearables of the &apos;90s. </p><p>I owned the original Bandai Tamagotchi from 1996 and the Pokemon Pikachu in &apos;98. I have vague, nostalgia-tinted memories of raising my Tamagotchi to adulthood and running with my marathoner dad wearing my Pikachu pedometer to make the little monster happy. They both felt larger and more real than the dozens of pixels that displayed them.</p><p>Also, they <em>definitely</em> didn&apos;t die from neglect or abandon me for my lack of steps. You&apos;d have to dig them out of boxes in my parents&apos; garage to prove it. In my mind, they&apos;re still alive, just like Schrödinger&apos;s cat.</p><p>Anyway, as someone with a sedentary job, I rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">smartwatch move alerts</a> or stand reminders to stay healthy, but I&apos;m always looking for new ways to stay motivated. Most people push themselves to close their daily rings or keep up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">10,000-steps-a-day streak</a>, but it&apos;s very impersonal, and once you fall short, it can be hard to reestablish a routine. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing two Pokemon cheering for you on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Imagine a combination of Pokemon Sleep and Pikmin Bloom on your wrist </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Either a fitness watch&apos;s watch face or a smartwatch app would be the perfect place to revive &apos;90s virtual pets as a cute way to reward you for working out — or emotionally torment you for slacking off. </p><p>Imagine a little Pikachu (or copyright-safe critter) that responds to your activity. If you&apos;ve walked 500 steps in the last hour, he&apos;ll be strolling along happily. Complete a tracked activity, and you&apos;ll see a custom animation like lifting weights or swimming next to a Goldeen. But if you spend all day sitting, your virtual pet lays down and looks sulky. After enough days or weeks of neglect, it leaves, and you have to start over by catching a new critter.</p><p>If you wanted to capture that original Tamagotchi vibe, you could make it so you have to feed, entertain, and clean up after your pet, with it getting sick or dying from neglect in a worst-case scenario. Or you could make it sync with a goal-setting phone app like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finch.finch&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Finch</a> that rewards you for finishing all kinds of activities, not just fitness ones. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon-2.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing Mewtwo in a pod on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I lean towards simplicity and style, which would make such a feature ubiquitous enough to catch on. While an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> has the display space and RAM for an in-depth app, an active care system would lead to most people abandoning their virtual pets after the novelty wears off.</p><p>An automatic, <em>reactive</em> virtual pet tuned into your fitness data and customized to your fitness level or personal goals would be a really cute motivator. It could appear on your main watch face or as a tappable icon in a watch complication. The latter probably makes the most sense to preserve battery life, so you only see animations when actively checking on your virtual pet&apos;s condition. </p><p>Ideally, you could choose a different kind of pet based on how active you are in everyday life. A virtual cat would be more okay with long, lazy stretches, while serious athletes might raise (or level up to) a more active animal.</p><p>If I could see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> pet based on Fitbit Premium data throughout my day, that&apos;d be pretty darn cool! Samsung, which already has sleep animals to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-watch-4-update-watch-faces-setup-youtube-music-google-assistant">judge your sleep quality</a> and intends to launch a "My Vitality Score" this summer, could easily expand on its current system and use Samsung Health data to control your pet&apos;s health on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. For example, if you sleep badly, your virtual pet will have bags under its eyes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RKwCcUwPQqU8LdnarQWBAV" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-snowman.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 with a festive watch face showing a half-built snowman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RKwCcUwPQqU8LdnarQWBAV.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;d assume this kind of feature would require a proper smartwatch with enough processing power for animations. But I&apos;d like to see this feature on battery-saving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, too, since they&apos;re the most likely to have in-depth training data to pull from.</p><p>Last year, I spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-adds-four-free-christmas-watch-faces">Garmin holiday faces</a> (like the one above) that would start empty and then build a snowman or decorate a tree based on how many intensity minutes you completed. And other dynamic watch faces adjust to different pictures as the day progresses. </p><p>Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> have started adding more AMOLED displays, sleep coaching, and enough storage space for massive topographical maps or music playlists, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they could squeeze in more variable watch faces that adjust based on your weekly mileage, monthly steps, or other data, without needing a ton of RAM. The same applies to other fitness brands, too!</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe the virtual pets fad died out because the stakes were just as virtual. Once you forget to play with it and it dies, you realize how little impact it has on your life, and you move on. </p><p>In this scenario, there&apos;s something symbolically unsettling about neglecting your virtual pet — an avatar for your bodily health and fitness. It&apos;s easy to ignore an empty graph if you don&apos;t close a ring for a day, but harder when you see Pikachu tapping his foot impatiently. </p><p>Gamifying your fitness is nothing new, and we already have plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-favorite-running-and-walking-apps-for-motivation">motivational running and walking apps</a> to inspire us. But having a cute, animated creature on your wrist to celebrate your victories and nudge you into restarting your workout routine would be especially inspiring. </p><p>Here&apos;s hoping brands like Samsung or Apple decide to bring back this &apos;90s fad for the kids-at-heart like me who need help staying fit!</p>
