                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Good power banks aren't hard to find, but they sure cost a pretty penny. Not this Black Friday though, because EcoFlow's epic 5,000mAh Qi2 power bank is on sale for an epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DFWHK1RB"><strong>43% off on Amazon</strong></a>. I reviewed this little magnetic battery pack and adored its compact size.</p><p>Whether you're planning on upgrading to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">Samsung Galaxy</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare">Google Pixel this Black Friday</a>, EcoFlow's RAPID Magnetic Power Bank (5000mAh) will surely push 30W of speed to it via USB-C. And if you want to ditch the mess with cables, you, the device supports 15W Qi2 wireless charging too.</p><p>Because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ecoflow-rapid-magnetic-power-bank-5000mah">EcoFlow RAPID</a> has a capacity of 5,000mAh, it manages to have quite a petite footprint. There's a 10,000mAh variant of the power bank too, but that one isn't as lightweight or compact. The best part is, you can buy it for only $39.99 at the moment whereas it usually costs $69.99.</p><p>There are two very unique factors about this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">excellent power bank</a> that will make you want it even more.</p>

Despite it being a new release, you can already score a solid 43% discount on it! This cuts down the $69.99 price tag to almost half off. You don't want to miss this golden Black Friday deal.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://us.ecoflow.com/products/rapid-magnetic-power-bank-5000mah">Eco Flow - $39.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DFWHK1RB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="65ecfb43-fcc9-460c-a7de-df4f9a7bfbe6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$69.99" data-dimension48="$69.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a 30W wired, 15W wireless, and magnetic power bank with Qi2 support, a kickstand, and a USB-C cable built-in.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want more than 5,000mAh on the go and several ports.</p><p>The first cool thing about the EcoFlow RAPID Magnetic Power Bank (5000mAh) is that it comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB Type-C cable</a> built-in. So you don't even need to carry a cable if you've got one of these in your bag.</p><p>Another interesting feature of the EcoFlow RAPID Magnetic Power Bank is that it comes with a clip-shaped kickstand built-in. It might look flimsy, but according to my testing, it can prop up big phones both in portrait and landscape orientations.</p><p>So really, you get a wired charger, wireless charger, and a kickstand all in one accessory with the EcoFlow RAPID. The built-in cable is a bonus too. The only downside is that you need to use another cable to charge the power bank itself. There's a secondary USB-C port on the side for that. Fortunately, both the input and output speeds are 30W, so recharging the power bank doesn't take long.</p>

Amazon's Quest 3S package includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K"><strong>a free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow, a three-month trial to Meta Quest Plus, AND a $75 Amazon digital credit</strong></a> at no additional cost!

<p>It's not all that often that we cover patents, but Samsung might be cooking up something rather exciting. As of November 11, Samsung was granted a patent for an "electronic games console," as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-foldable-gaming-handheld-patent/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a> spotted a listing that appeared on the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) website.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://designdb.wipo.int/designdb/en/showData.jsp?ID=USID.D1051226" target="_blank">listing</a>, Samsung Display Co., Ltd. filed for the patent in September 2022, and it was registered as of November 12. Unsurprisingly, there aren't any other specifics about the internals of this handheld.</p>
<ul><li><em><strong></strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024"><em><strong>Black Friday is here early for many of the best Samsung devices.</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>However, there are a variety of patent drawings that were published, giving us an idea of how it might work. At first glance, this handheld looks pretty similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, with a couple of major differences.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1260px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.14%;"><img id="9UepuSGqDPCwU4Uc36whNa" name="samsung-gaming-handheld-console-wipo-patent-filing" alt="Patent drawings of a foldable gaming handheld console from Samsung" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UepuSGqDPCwU4Uc36whNa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1260" height="1602" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WIPO / Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first of which is that the screen faces outward, a concept that we have yet to see Samsung implement outside of some concept designs to showcase at various trade shows. In fact, the only companies to really venture down that path have been Huawei and Honor, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-just-showed-off-a-foldable-that-you-carry-as-a-purse">Honor V Purse</a> was released in 2023, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">Huawei's Mate XT</a> tri-foldable phone was revealed in September.</p><p>Durability concerns likely play a big part in why we haven't seen outward-folding phones, making this potential gaming handheld even more intriguing. Adding to the intrigue is how you interpret the patent drawings. On one hand, it looks like it features one screen, but a couple of the drawings indicate that there might actually be two different screens that join together when unfolded.</p><p>Then again, we could be looking at two different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>, with one that folds, and another one that doesn't. If it is indeed two different handhelds, it would help explain the differences in controls when looking at Figure 2 and Figure 3.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's easy to get excited about Samsung potentially releasing a gaming handheld, we have to take this with a massive grain of salt. For one, it's only a patent, and we know that companies file patents for devices that never see the light of day.</p><p>Then, there's the whole concern about what the future holds for Samsung's current crop of foldable phones. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">Rumors suggest</a> that Samsung sold less than 300,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> devices in the first two weeks, falling far short of the Galaxy Z Fold 5.</p><p>In October, the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition was released in South Korea, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-might-be-flopping-in-the-us-but-its-special-edition-is-winning-in-korea">reportedly selling through</a> all three batches of pre-orders. While that might be the case, there's no way of knowing how many devices Samsung actually manufactured for release, especially since it was limited to certain regions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2049px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5uz77HBoYbWXfKBcYJSKij" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-6.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5uz77HBoYbWXfKBcYJSKij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2049" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, rumors continue to swirl around Samsung potentially releasing a tri-foldable competitor to the Mate XT. However, if sales are as bad as reports make it seem, it wouldn't come as a surprise if Samsung decided to cut its losses and drop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/are-foldable-phones-actually-better-than-tablets">foldable phones</a> for good.</p><p>Let's hope that's not the case, and that this newly-discovered foldable gaming handheld actually comes to fruition. In the meantime, now's a great time to join the Galaxy Z Fold 6 bandwagon thanks to various Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. Then, you can pair it with a gaming controller, load up some games, and make your own foldable Android handheld.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is the latest Android OEM to dive into AI, and the company is finally giving more users a taste of what it's been cooking up. On Wednesday (Nov 27), Motorola announced a new open beta program for its new Moto AI features, which it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-at-tech-world-2024/">teased</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Among these new Moto AI features is Catch Me Up, which summarizes a user's notifications in a concise and easy-to-view manner. This way, if you're too busy to pay attention to your phone, you can call up Moto AI, and it will show you a panel with a summary of the calls and texts you received, including any contextual information within the messages that you may want to know. This way, you can choose what to prioritize as you catch up with your notifications.</p>

<p>Pay Attention is essentially an enhanced recorder app. It will record conversations then transcribe and summarize them afterward so you can "recall specific instructions or details without having to write notes or listen to long recordings."</p><p>Remember This lets Moto AI remember and recall certain events or information based on images, screenshots, and even text notes. These moments are saved in a Journal and include AI-generated insights, which can be recalled later on if you need to remember certain things. It sounds a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> and should help save time by keeping you from endless scrolling of screenshots, photos, and notes.</p><p>According to Motorola, these are stored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>, and users choose what they want to save to their Journal.</p>

<p>In addition to these features, there's a new search bar that will appear when calling up Moto AI, which can be used to ask questions using natural language to search on device or on the web. Users can also quickly launch features with the search bar using Smart Actions.</p><p>These new Moto AI features will join the current ones, which include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-first-things">Magic Canvas</a> and Action Shot. Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">demonstrated these features at Lenovo Tech World 2024</a> along with a new Large Action Model, a proof of concept that fully executes actions within apps based on your habits and what it knows about you. However, as cool as that feature is, it seems Motorola is not yet ready for public testing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5" name="Moto-AI-LAM-Starbucks-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-5.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3749" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the aforementioned features, users can try them out starting today by registering for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/moto-ai">open beta program</a> either via Motorola's website or by waiting for the notification to pop up on their eligible device. The program is open globally, and eligible devices include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> (Razr 50 Ultra), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> (Razr 50), and Edge 50 Ultra.</p><p>Users will be able to provide feedback on their experiences, and Motorola says it will "help shape Moto experiences, ensuring that what’s developed meets consumer wants and needs."</p>

The XM5 are better, but are they worth an additional $100? No.</p>

<p>The WH-1000XM4 are still among the best headphones you can get at the moment, and this deal brings them down to their lowest price. If you've been eyeing these for a while and haven't made the switch yet, now is the time to do so.</p>

<p>Sony did all the right things with the WH-1000XM4. They have a lightweight design, and the ear pads are very comfortable even with extended use. The swivel design means you can get a secure fit without too much of an effort, and they fold down easily, making them a great choice for portability.</p><p>And when it comes to active noise cancellation, these headphones truly stand out. You get excellent isolation even if you&apos;re in a noisy environment, and these are particularly well-suited to flights. I clocked hundreds of hours of travel time on the XM3, and these go even further at blocking ambient noise.</p><p>All the other extras are present: you get multi-device connectivity, a rock-solid connection over Bluetooth 5.0, and if you still make regular calls, these have five built-in mics that do a great job picking up your voice. And they easily last over 20 hours, so you&apos;ll ideally need to charge once a week — and there&apos;s fast charging tech if you&apos;re in a hurry.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the sound. The WH-1000XM4 still hold their own when it comes to audio quality, delivering a vibrant soundstage with a highly engaging bass. I recommend using a utility like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pittvandewitt.wavelet">Wavelet</a> to get the best out of the sound of the XM4. Anyway, the WH-1000XM4 continue to be an easy recommendation, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3">coming in at $198</a>, you&apos;re getting an unbeatable value right now.</p>

They come with tons of timer and scheduling options, a setting for making your lighting interact with music, and 100 separate scene modes to choose from to combine colors and overall vibes. Along with the pre-made lighting scene modes, you can also make your own, or find those programmed by other users.</p><p>The company says these are suitable for year-round outdoor use because they're made from an anti-ultraviolet material, and they feature an IP67 water and dust resistance rating—though the control box and adapter are only IP65).</p><p>While these are fairly highly reviewed on Amazon, it is worth noting that the retailer calls these a "frequently returned item." A few reviewers note that the lights stopped working after some time, though Amazon does offer a 30-day return policy in case you want to see for yourself.</p><p>The vast majority of those who left less than five-star reviews, however, mostly pointed to the mobile app as more of an annoyance than a dealbreaker. More specifically, users reported that the app is laid out pretty unintuitively and is a bit clunky to navigate, making it tough to find some settings. Ultimately, though, these lights seem to get the job done for most, and many say they appreciate their brightness and customizability.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Currently, lock screen notifications are intrusive in Android 15, taking up a lot of space and obscuring your wallpaper.</li><li>Activated code strings in Android 15 QPR2 introduce a new "Lock screen minimalism" option.</li><li>When enabled, this setting will show fewer notifications on the lock screen and show small icons instead of full-size banners.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> includes a few different ways to view your notifications. There are app icons in the status bar, banners in the notifications shade, and the same banners on the lock screen. If you happen to get a lot of notifications throughout the day, that might cause your lock screen to get cluttered pretty quickly. To solve this problem, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-1-pixel-test-start">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a> includes a new "Lock screen notification minimalism" setting, as uncovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-lock-screen-notification-minimalism-3503283/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>The code strings for the option explain that it will "show fewer notifications on the lock screen. Mishaal Rahman, writing for Android Authority, managed to activate the feature early, and noted that it didn't seem to actually reduce the total number of notifications on the lock screen — though that may be coming later.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="lock_screen_notif_minimalism">Lock screen notification minimalism</string>
<string name="lock_screen_notif_minimalism_summary">Show fewer notifications on lock screen</string></code></pre>
<p>Instead, the feature currently appears to minimize lock screen notifications, only showing their icons in a tiny pill-shaped area underneath the clock. You can tap it to reveal the notification title and body for each one in the list, much like the current lock screen implementation. It adds an extra tap to the process, but might be worthwhile in exchange for the more minimalist lock screen view, which really shows off your wallpaper.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:566px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.73%;"><img id="XdNJgSZZzgsmYBCh2UVkQB" name="Android_15_QPR2_Beta_1_with_lock_screen_notification_minimalism.jpg" alt="The different Lock Screen options in Android 15 QPR2 beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdNJgSZZzgsmYBCh2UVkQB.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="566" height="1272" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>Lock screen notification minimalism</strong> feature is available as a toggle in the settings app in Android 15 QPR 2 Beta 1. It can be enabled or disabled, depending on your preferences. However, it appears the feature is still in development and we don't know when it might release, or exactly what it might do when it does.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-black-friday-2">When is Black Friday?</h2>
<p>Black Friday officially hits on November 29th, but there are already a ton of great deals on display. Whether you're on the hunt for a new smartphone, wearable, or Chromebook, we're using our years of experience to track down all the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday deals</a> from across the web so you don't have to go looking.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-wait-for-cyber-monday-to-buy-a-chromebook-2">Should I wait for Cyber Monday to buy a Chromebook?</h2>
<p>While Cyber Monday typically presents some great deals on tech, for most products, Black Friday is still the best sale of the year. If none of the deals in this guide appeal to you yet, you might as well wait and see if anything new goes on sale for Cyber Monday. If a particular offer <em>did</em> catch your eye, however, I wouldn't wait to make your move.</p>
<h2 id="chromebook-vs-tablet-which-should-i-buy-2">Chromebook vs Tablet: Which should I buy?</h2>
<p>One of the most common questions we see is whether you should buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebook-vs-android-tablet-which-best">Chromebook versus a tablet</a>. In some instances, you can get the best of both worlds, with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11</a> and ASUS Chromebook CM30 Detachable. However, those aren't quite as powerful as the best Android tablets.</p><p>However, if productivity is the name of the game, then you're probably better served by one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> anyway. Many of these feature the same processors and specs as their Windows counterparts, without the exorbitant price tags.</p><p>Ultimately, it really comes down to what you plan on using the Chromebook or tablet. Suppose you want something that's a bit more portable. In that case, a tablet might be the way to go but don't forget there are plenty of Chromebooks with convertible designs, aiming to offer even better versatility.</p>

<hr>
<p>Before we get deep into the holidays, Instagram is detailing a few updates for its DM experience.</p><p>Headlining the updates today (Nov 26) is the ability for users to share their live location via DMs. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-instagram-dm-features-update">Newsroom post</a>, Instagram states you can share your location "privately" in one-on-one and group chat DM threads. The platform states your shared location in a chat will "disappear after one hour."</p><p>For the sender, users in Instagram's DMs will see a small map preview detailing where in the world they are. A blue "share your location" button will submit a snapshot preview of where you are alongside your profile icon in the chat. Others can tap the "View" button to see a map with specifics.</p><p>Instagram highlights a few security/privacy advisories, stating users will notice an "indicator" at the top of a chat thread, alerting them to their shared location. Moreover, users have the option to stop sharing where they are at any time. For peace of mind, Instagram states others in your chats <em>cannot </em>"forward" your location to another chat.</p><p>The ability to share your location via Instagram DMs is rolling out today (Nov 26); however, its usability is only available "in select countries."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="woHgKn6BjrTHRMTHX26psE" name="instagram-dms-share-location-update" alt="Instagram DMs now let users share their live location with others." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woHgKn6BjrTHRMTHX26psE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="601" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instagram's DMs are also picking up a new nickname feature. Users will be able to customize a unique, quirky name for their friends or for themselves. As the update appears, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.instagram.com/598851592468668/?cms_platform=android-app&helpref=platform_switcher">users are instructed</a> to tap on their DMs and enter a chat. Tapping the name at the top, whether it's a group or a one-on-one thread, will open the "Nicknames" page.</p><p>A full list of those within the thread will appear alongside the option to tap on each and enter a unique title. Instagram highlights the option for users to decide <em>who </em>can edit their nickname in DMs, too. The platform states this is defaulted to "those you follow," but you can change this with a couple of other choices.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that these nicknames will not appear anywhere else but in your DMs.</p><p>Lastly, Instagram's mid-week update brings more stickers. The post states users will soon notice 17 new sticker packs become available. In total, users should have around 300 new stickers to play with and send to friends or family. All three updates should begin rolling out today (Nov 26), but it might take a while before everyone sees it.</p><p>This update for DMs arrives six days after the platform discussed an upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-bringing-recommendations-reset-button">reset option for your feed</a>. The feature is wrapped in testing; however, Meta states that users will (in the future) have the option to reset their entire set of feed recommendations. The company states this will give a user a "fresh start" when viewing feeds, exploring tabs, and watching Reels.</p><p>Durning its test, Meta states this reset button is geared toward teens as their interests/tastes tend to change and evolve over time. The company states it wants to "give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience."</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a smart ring for tracking your activities and health without paying a premium for the latest model.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want to pay for a subscription or want the latest Oura Ring 4 for its improved health tracking.</p>
<p>When I first reviewed the Oura Ring Gen 3, I was already quite impressed with its capabilities. From its impressive sleep tracking to its week-long battery life, the Oura Ring Gen 3 became a staple in my life, not just for my physical health, but my mental health as well.</p><p>Even more impressive is the fact that Oura continues to add new features and capabilities to the app and ring, making this a long-term device that you don't really have to worry about upgrading every year, which is what helped make it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> we've reviewed. So even though the newer Oura Ring 4 is available, you can be sure that Oura will continue supporting the Gen 3 for as long as it can. That's what makes the smart ring worth looking at, even with Oura's low-cost $6/month subscription.</p><p>Oh, and if you're still on the fence, you should know that you can also use your FSA or HSA to purchase the ring, which could help you pull the trigger.</p>
