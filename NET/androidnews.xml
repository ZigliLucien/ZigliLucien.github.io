Pessimistic is probably too nice of a word because when looking at the rest of the market, it&apos;s abundantly clear that Samsung is no longer the market leader.</p><p>As the rumors and leaks made headlines, whatever excitement I had for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 quickly dissipated. And during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, the larger foldable seemed like an afterthought, taking a back seat to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>I understand that book-style foldable phones aren&apos;t as popular, likely due to their higher prices and the fact that not everyone wants or cares about the benefits of having a mini tablet that fits in your pocket. So, while many, including my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Derrek</a>, prefer a flip phone, it&apos;s just not my cup of tea.</p><p>However, the more time that I spent using the Fold 6, the more my disappointment began to fade. Trust me, it came as more of a shock to me than I expected, especially when I looked around at the current state of the foldable phone market. That being said, while Samsung managed to change my mind in some ways, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still a mixed bag.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5VELWyr9aGSeRw6tnDLFA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-2.jpg" alt="Angled view of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VELWyr9aGSeRw6tnDLFA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold 6 at its Unpacked event on July 10, alongside an array of additional Galaxy devices. The phone is currently available after being released in late July 2024, with a starting price of $1,899 for the 256GB base model and maxing out at $2,259 for the 1TB version.</p><p>Additionally, there are a total of five colors to choose from: Pink, Navy, Silver Shadow, Crafted Black, and White. However, the latter two colors are only available if you purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 6 directly from Samsung&apos;s website.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-design-and-cover-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Design and Cover Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-11.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>Wider design and displays feel less cramped.</strong></li><li><strong>Noticeably lighter than its predecessors.</strong></li></ul>
<p>If I&apos;m so pessimistic, what could Samsung possibly have done to even change my mind in the slightest? Well, it actually starts with the boxier design. This move brings it more in line with what we saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, complete with the bottom left corner digging into the palm of my hand.</p><p>On paper, this design tweak brought with it a 1.05mm increase in the dimensions when closed, making for an ever-so-slightly larger cover screen. It really didn&apos;t seem like much, but I&apos;ve noticed that my hands feel less cramped when typing out messages or jotting down some notes. Really, it&apos;s not much of a difference, but it&apos;s enough to be noticeable while still falling far short of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-20.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open Cover Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Arguably even more important is that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is substantially lighter than its predecessor. In terms of numbers, Samsung managed to slim it down to 239 grams, a staggering drop from the 253 grams of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a>. It&apos;s definitely noticeable, and welcome, especially when using the Fold 6 with one hand while the phone is closed.</p><p>I&apos;ve made it this far without even talking about the inner display or AI, which is more than what some companies can say. That being said, let&apos;s dive into that now, starting with the inner screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hinge"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Hinge</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else Samsung changed with the design is that it&apos;s now much easier to actually unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6. There&apos;s a little bit more of a gap between the two sides of the frame. This might sound like a bad thing, but the outer border of the inner screen still closes tightly so that dust and debris don&apos;t make it through.</p><p>I discovered this, as one does, when using the Fold 6 as a fidget toy. I don&apos;t even know how I managed to do it, but I was able to slightly open the phone with just one hand. The only other book-style foldable I&apos;ve been able to do that with is the OnePlus Open.</p><p>The reason why I&apos;m pointing this out is because it&apos;s just much easier to unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5">compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. The hinge feels about as perfect as one can get, even smoother than the Pixel Fold and the Open. Not to mention that I don&apos;t feel much resistance (in a good way), and the screen/hinge doesn&apos;t make discomforting noises. I&apos;m hoping the hinge will stay this way, but it&apos;s obviously too early to say with any certainty.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-inner-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Inner screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screens-open.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 side-by-side with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>Beautiful AMOLED display.</strong></li><li><strong>The crease has improved compared to the Z Fold 5.</strong></li><li><strong>The screen is much brighter and easier to view outdoors.</strong></li></ul>
<p>With the Fold 6 open, I&apos;m now staring at a beautiful AMOLED display with a subtle crease down the middle. Seriously, Samsung does make some of the best screens. It&apos;s just a shame and quite frustrating that the company won&apos;t offer any reasons or remedies to those who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">suffer from PWM</a>. One would think that if a company is trying to reach as many people as possible, it would do something or at least give a disclaimer that the screens might affect you negatively.</p><p>Nevertheless, let&apos;s talk about that crease. If I was just going into this thing blind without having a Z Fold 5 to compare it to, I&apos;d probably say that the crease is the same with the Fold 6. That&apos;s not the case, as I do notice a slight difference between the two. It&apos;s not much, but there is a difference. However, I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s because the Fold 5 is a year old or if Samsung actually did manage to improve the crease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-19.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 screen on in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even still, there is one thing that didn&apos;t take me long to notice, as all I had to do was use the inner screen while outside. This thing gets BRIGHT. No, it&apos;s not going to blind you or anything, but it&apos;s definitely brighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5. That&apos;s because Samsung&apos;s display now reaches a peak brightness of 2,600 nits.</p><p>This is the same peak brightness level as Samsung introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> Ultra, surpassing the 1,750 nits found in the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The one thing that the Fold 6s main display doesn&apos;t adopt from the S24 Ultra is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">anti-reflective coating</a>. It&apos;s not all that surprising since we&apos;re still working with ultra-thin glass and plastic, but I figured it was worth mentioning.</p>

<p>One of the main draws of Samsung&apos;s latest foldable phones is the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, "Sketch to Image" being chief among them. Before going further, I invite you to enjoy a hearty laugh at my drawings. There&apos;s a reason why I take pictures and type on a keyboard for a living.</p><p>Okay, with that out of the way, I think this is arguably one of the coolest things that&apos;s possible with Galaxy AI. You can either draw something out in the Samsung Notes app or use AI to generate images. I know my "artistry" is on par with a 3rd grader, but c&apos;mon, I expected results better than what I got.</p>

<p>However, where this feature managed to impress was when making additions to pictures I&apos;ve taken. For the first one, I tried to draw a sailboat with shark fins surrounding it. So while it didn&apos;t exactly get what I was going for, the end result was much better than expected, even adding reflections in the water.</p>

<p>Next up was drawing a crown on my son&apos;s head of a picture I snapped while out at a local crab house. This one turned out just about perfect, and you can&apos;t even tell that it&apos;s AI-generated, except for the watermark in the bottom left corner. There&apos;s no way to avoid this, even when using Samsung&apos;s built-in wallpaper generator.</p><p>One of the problems here, at least with Sketch to Image, is that it&apos;s really just a parlor trick, albeit an impressive one. After spending some time with Pixel Studio on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">new Pixel 9 phones</a>, I realized that sometimes it&apos;s better to type out what you want to see, as opposed to trying to draw it. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&apos;s not currently an option with Galaxy AI, which is a bit disappointing. Frankly, I didn&apos;t even know this was an option I would want until I was messing around with Pixel Studio. But now that I know it&apos;s possible, I hope to see Samsung adopt it in a future software update.</p><p>So, using Galaxy AI to add things to your pictures can be pretty fun. But what about removing items or people from those pictures? In my time using the Fold 6, it&apos;s been pretty hit or miss.</p>

<p>When I went to Alexandria to take some pictures with the Fold 6 on a beautiful and clear day, I stumbled upon the "<em>Providence</em>." It&apos;s a "reproduction of the first ship authorized to serve in the Continental Navy," which for someone who&apos;s a bit of a history buff, is pretty darn awesome. </p><p>Although I didn&apos;t jump on for a tour, I did walk around until the next tour got underway so I could try and snap a few pics from the shoreline walkway. However, there were a few smaller boats that were following behind the <em>Providence</em><em><strong> </strong></em>but that doesn&apos;t really make for a great picture.</p>

<p>So, I tried using the object removal tool built into Samsung&apos;s Gallery app to get rid of the smaller boats. It worked fine with the boat right behind the <em>Providence</em>, but no matter what I tried, I could not get rid of the other boat further back. Pinch-to-zoom, circling the boat, drawing over the top of it—nothing.</p><p>Then, I switched over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, pulled up the same picture, and in a few seconds, it was gone. On the one hand, it&apos;s great being able to use Galaxy AI and Photos in tandem to make edits. But at that point, why would I even bother trying to use the native photo editing when Google Photos is going to do a better job anyway?</p>

<p>Samsung makes the most performant and powerful Android phone on the market. Rinse and repeat for every flagship Galaxy phone, and it continues to ring true with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Honestly, I could probably just call it here, as we know what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy can do by now.</p><p>Much like the cameras, the rest of the internals remain the same, meaning we have 12GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage, and a 4,400mAh battery. Although it doesn&apos;t really affect the performance, Samsung is falling a bit behind as the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Fold Pro</a> have upped the RAM to 16GB. </p><p>It would&apos;ve made sense for Samsung to do the same, even if it might seem like overkill. With seven years of promised updates, there&apos;s a pretty good chance that having additional RAM would pay dividends. Only time will tell if that&apos;s the case, but I can&apos;t help but feel like the Fold 6 is at a disadvantage in the long term. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise is that even with all of the extra software features, the Fold 6 doesn&apos;t skip a beat. While it&apos;s easy to point out how the competition is leaving Samsung in the rear-view mirror, the reality is that I still much prefer the flexibility and versatility offered by One UI. </p><p>While Open Canvas on the OnePlus Open is arguably more intuitive for multitasking, it just doesn&apos;t really <em>work</em> the way my brain does. I much prefer the way that Samsung implements multitasking via split screens, floating windows, and the option to "force" apps to take advantage, even if the developers haven&apos;t implemented the appropriate APIs.</p><p>And if the "out-of-the-box" experience isn&apos;t enough, you always have Good Lock to take things up a couple of notches. Whether you&apos;re simply using your favorite icon pack or setting up a bunch of Bixby Routines, Samsung really does offer a "do it all" experience.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s one thing that I&apos;ve been screaming from the rooftops for the past couple of years, it&apos;s that we deserve flagship cameras on foldable phones. I was really hoping that the Fold 6 would <em>finally </em>be the catalyst for change, but alas, it wasn&apos;t meant to be. Samsung opted to rely on the same hardware it introduced three years ago with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-a-week-with-the-z-fold-5-coming-home">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. </p><p>It&apos;s not so much that you can&apos;t still get great pictures out of the Fold 6 because you definitely can. Instead, it&apos;s more of the fact that we <em>know</em> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> can be equipped with cameras capable of rivaling slab phones. Don&apos;t believe me? Just look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">Vivo X Fold 3 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Honor Magic V3</a>. </p>

<p>I&apos;m not really sure what Samsung is doing here, besides deciding to rely purely on image processing to try and offset the outdated hardware. But when you pay $1,800 for a phone, you expect it to be at the top of the class, and that&apos;s just not the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>With my mini-rant out of the way, I found the same thing that I usually find when using cameras on Samsung foldable phones — they&apos;re good, or even great, as long as the conditions are perfect. As soon as a wrench gets thrown, you&apos;re at the mercy of steady hands and steady subjects. </p>

<p>A good example of this is when I tried to take pictures of my six-month-old son. He&apos;s a wiggle worm in the truest sense, constantly moving around and reaching for something. Needless to say, it&apos;s almost like he&apos;s unintentionally providing the "ultimate camera stress test." </p><p>In one instance, he had woken up from a nap, and I walked down the hallway to get him up. Seeing as he recently learned to sit up on his own, I was greeted with this adorable and goofy face looking at me before I even made it into his room. I did what most people would do: I grabbed the Fold 6 and tried to snap a quick picture. </p><p>For some additional context, the hallway was dark, and I was still about 20-25 feet away from him, as I didn&apos;t want him to move too much if I were to actually go into the room. Instead, I just pinched to try and zoom in and get a closer look from afar.</p><p>However, I couldn&apos;t have been more disappointed in the results. </p>

<p>Not only was he no longer looking at me by the time the picture was captured, but he was almost unrecognizable. The amount of processing done to the picture has basically ruined it completely, which, in turn, ruins a moment that I&apos;ll never have back. Sure, the same scenario will probably play out again, but I know that if the Fold 6 is the phone in my pocket, I&apos;m better off just taking a mental snapshot and going to get him out of the crib. </p><p>Were the conditions perfect? Nope. And that&apos;s my point about these cameras. If I had my iPhone or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> in my pocket instead, that picture would <em>probably</em> turn out a lot better. I can&apos;t say with any certainty that would be the case, because it&apos;s not like I could put life on pause for a split-second so I could grab another phone. </p><p>So, instead of having a hilarious picture to send to family and friends, I have a blurry mess that looks more AI-generated than what I get when I use Sketch to Image.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when Samsung and its Galaxy Z Fold was the only game in town. In terms of book-style foldable phones, Samsung&apos;s stiffest competition comes from OnePlus and Google. The former burst onto the scene in late 2023 with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a>, which is essentially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-and-n3-flip-global-launch">Oppo Find N3</a> with OnePlus branding. </p><p>Meanwhile, Google has the Pixel Fold, which comes with its own list of benefits and pitfalls. However, that shouldn&apos;t be the case for too much longer as Google announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. However, we&apos;ll have to wait and see how the phone performs and whether it arrives as a truly viable alternative.  </p><p>That&apos;s pretty much all we have if looking at Samsung&apos;s competition domestically. The story dramatically shifts when considering global markets as Honor, Vivo, and others have caught up and surpassed Samsung&apos;s offerings. Notably, Xiaomi recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Fold 4</a>, with an initial launch in China ahead of a global launch at a later date. </p>

<p>It&apos;s still difficult to decide whether to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Outside of the OnePlus Open and Pixel Fold 9 Pro, there are not many easily accessible alternatives in the U.S. </p><p>With the former, you won&apos;t be able to walk into a carrier store and pick one up, and even with trade-in deals, that&apos;s a tough pill to swallow. However, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold already looks to be quite an impressive second showing for Google, but you can&apos;t buy it just yet.</p><p>It&apos;s not like I hate the Galaxy Z Fold 6; it&apos;s just that I wish that Samsung would be an innovator in the space instead of just sitting back and counting its cash. Yes, the design is a surprising improvement over the Fold 5, and the performance is still top-notch. But it just kind of sucks to see the smallest of updates arrive for a phone that costs $1,800 from a company that has the potential for so much more.</p><p>All of that being said, until we can spend some quality time with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still the best foldable for the majority of people. </p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Why do we need to put our phones in airplane mode when traveling by plane? Can a phone really affect the electronics in an airplane?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>I love questions like this. Not only is there a bit of a technical issue involved, but it&apos;s one of those things that seems like a relic of the past. To top it off, there&apos;s no cut-and-dried answer.</p><p>In case you&apos;re here just looking for a quick answer, I like to give it up front: There are two reasons why the captain or flight crew tells us to use airplane mode. It <em>could</em> electronically interfere with the plane and it forces us to pay attention during take-off and landing.</p>
<p><strong>A quick reminder of what airplane mode means:</strong> It is a setting on your phone that disables all radio frequency communication in and out of it. You can usually go back in and enable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth once it&apos;s activated, but enabling it will kill any signal to and from your phone. It exists as a quick way to turn everything off at once like you&apos;re asked to do on an airplane.</p>
<p>Now, some more about why we still need to do this. Notice I used the word "could" in the short answer above. Nobody is saying that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> <em>will</em> mess with the electronics on a plane, but <em>there is a chance</em>. While the FAA doesn&apos;t have any case data showing that cellular use has caused a problem, there is a chance.</p><p>There&apos;s actually a chance of it happening with two specific things: the headsets pilots use to communicate with each other and the plane&apos;s altimeter. Again, it isn&apos;t likely that there will be a problem and no data is saying it has ever been one, but the radio frequency of some signals overlaps with these two systems.</p>
<p>If you can remember back when we had cordless landline phones, you might also remember seeing them mess with broadcast television or even hearing truck drivers talk on the C.B. radio through them. That&apos;s because the frequencies used are very close to each other, and one signal can be strong enough to bleed over. It&apos;s funny hearing the phone make the TV crackle and beep. It&apos;s not so funny if you trying to call your friend messes with the pilot trying to talk to the copilot or a flight attendant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7" name="airplane-mode.jpg" alt="Airplane mode toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-5g-pose-threat-airline-industry">Interference with aircraft altimeters</a> is another possibly real issue that&apos;s already caused problems — not for aircraft, but for Verizon and AT&T.</p><p>Without getting too nerdy, I&apos;ll explain. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/c-band-and-mid-band-5g-what-it-and-why-its-important-your-next-phone">C band spectrum</a> in the 3.7 to 3.98GHz range was auctioned off to phone carriers for use with 5G networks. Aircraft altimeters operate in the 4.2 to 4.4GHz range. AT&T and Verizon famously had to halt plans to roll out part of their 5G network in places close to airports because these signals are close enough to bleed into each other. An airplane needs to know how high above the ground it is, and some 5G cell towers could interfere.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re flying low enough that your phone tries to connect using these frequencies, there&apos;s a chance this could cause interference.</p><p>One thing all of this has in common is that it&apos;s based on the idea that it could happen, not that it will. When a tin can filled with people is up in the air, anything that has a possibility of making it fall out of the sky is a problem. A pilot and the airlines won&apos;t take chances and tell you to turn your phone off. If you don&apos;t listen, there may be consequences, too. It sounds silly, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>One last thing — having you turn your phone off means you&apos;re not trying to text your friend or boss while the plane is on the runway. Aircraft personnel want you to pay extra attention during take-off and landing, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-digital-wellbeing">pulling your head out of your phone</a> for a few minutes is one way to help make it happen.</p>

The Google Pixel 9 and the Google Pixel 9 Pro are similar in many ways, including their overall size and dimensions. This means that cases designed for one will fit the other, and vice versa. So, if you decide on the Pixel 9 and later want to upgrade, or you bought a case for one and then decided on getting the other, you don’t need to worry as it will fit.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-is-difference-between-the-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-2">What is difference between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro?</h2>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 and Google Pixel 9 Pro are two of four new phones Google announced at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google event</a> in August 2024, joined by the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> as well. The two phones, as noted, are identical in look, size, and dimensions. They also offer virtually the same features and specs but for a few minor differences. Naturally, the Pixel 9 Pro is a slight step up from the entry-level Pixel 9.</p><p>When looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro</a>, the latter has a much higher resolution and brighter screen, but both are 6.3 inches in size. The Pixel 9’s screen boasts 2,424 x 1,080 pixel resolution and the Pixel 9 Pro offers 2,856 x 1,280 pixel resolution. The latter is also a Super Actua LTPO OLED versus an Actua OLED. The Pixel 9 delivers up to 1,800 nits of brightness in HDR and 2,700 nits of peak brightness and the Pixel 9 Pro 2,000 nits of brightness in HDR and 3,000 nits of peak brightness. </p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro’s front camera is better at 42MP versus just 10.5MP in the Pixel 9 and the phone adds a 48MP Quad PD telephoto lens as well. There’s also an option for Super Res Zoom up to 30x with the main 50MP camera of the Pixel 9 Pro so you can get even better close-up shots from far away. </p><p>Additionally, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is equipped with more RAM at 16GB versus 12GB and there’s an option to get up to 1TB storage whereas the Pixel 9 taps out at just 256GB. This is useful for power users since neither phone has a microSD slot for expandable storage. </p><p>In terms of dimensions, both phones measure identical 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches, with the Pixel 9 weighing a single gram more at 198 grams versus 199 grams for the Pixel 9 Pro. But the weight has no bearing on how the cases fit. The cameras and side buttons are also identically placed, making swapping cases a cinch. </p><p>Bottom line: when it comes to protecting the Google Pixel 9 or Google Pixel 9 Pro with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">the best cases</a>, they are interchangeable. One will fit the other. This opens the door to plenty of options, with many cases already available for the new devices. While both these phones are relatively affordable, you’ll still want to protect your investment right away with a solid and fashionable case. While you’re at it, look into one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">best Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro screen protectors</a>, too.</p>

<p>Samsung didn't mess around with its formula for the Fold 6 too much, and that's starting to become a problem.

<p>The new Pixel 9 lineup is Google&apos;s strongest and most aggressive hardware launch yet. But what&apos;s even more impressive is its latest foldable called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Rather than calling it the Pixel Fold 2, Google is clubbing it with the rest of the new series, and that makes sense since it shares a lot of the features and hardware with the Pixel 9 phones. The new 9 Pro Fold has a major design overhaul and, to our surprise, comes at the same starting price as last year&apos;s model. </p><p>In the U.S., its biggest rival is going to be the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which has pretty much gone unchallenged in its segment and is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in the market. Newer offerings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> have given it good competition, but we think the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold will be its biggest opponent. With similar flagship hardware and a ton of AI software features, we pit the Google Pixel 9 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 to see if we have a definitive winner and which phone you should buy next. </p>

<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> looks nothing like the Pixel Fold from last year, and that&apos;s a good thing. The design is arguably much better; the new matte glass and aluminum finishes feel richer, and the ugly thick bezels inside the folding display are all gone. It looks like it&apos;s part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 family</a>. You get the same wide aspect ratio that we loved from the first model, but the chassis is now slimmer and lighter. It measures 10.5mm in depth when folded and just 5.1mm when unfolded. It&apos;s not the world&apos;s slimmest, but I&apos;ll take it. </p><p>The weight has also been reduced significantly, down to 257g. The phone comes in Obsidian and Porcelain colors. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-waterproof">The 9 Pro Fold is still IPX8-rated</a> for water resistance. One major annoyance we faced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was that it never quite unfolded completely flat, but Google has fixed that with the new model. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> looks more or less the same as the previous two generations, although it has a slightly wider aspect ratio this time. It&apos;s only just about noticeable if you&apos;re coming from an older Fold phone, but it&apos;s not enough to make the typing experience on the cover screen much better. Samsung, too, uses aluminum and glass for the construction, and the Fold 6 is lighter than the Pixel at 239g. It&apos;s still slightly thicker, though, at 12.1mm and 5.6mm in its folded and unfolded state, respectively. </p><p>Samsung offers way more colors, as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes in Silver, Shadow, Pink, and Navy. Crafted Black and White are two exclusive shades if you buy them via Samsung.com. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-waterproof">The Fold 6 is now IP48-rated</a> for "dust" and water resistance, but keep in mind that the dust resistance only protects it from solid particles larger than 1mm, which doesn&apos;t qualify as dust. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets new displays on the outside and inside. The outer display is a larger 6.3-inch Actua display with a 20:9 aspect ratio, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. It&apos;s an OLED with a Full HD+ resolution, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> protection, and a variable refresh rate of 60Hz-120Hz. Google claims it can get as bright as up to 1,800 nits for HDR content and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness. </p><p>The folding screen is larger too, at 8 inches. Google calls it a Super Actua Flex display. This OLED panel has a 2,076x2,152 resolution, UTG glass, and LTPO tech which can vary the refresh rate from 1Hz  to 120Hz. It has the same peak brightness as the outer screen, but HDR brightness is up to 1,600 nits. </p>

<p>Samsung brought some minor refinements to the display on the Fold 6, but not any major changes. The corners of the folding display are no longer curved, which is the opposite of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It&apos;s a 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel, features LTPO tech, and has a 2,160x1,856 resolution. Peak brightness is similar at 2,600 nits. </p><p>The outer display is a 6.3-inch AMOLED panel, but it&apos;s taller with a narrower 22.1:9 aspect ratio than the Pixel. It too has LTPO tech with a 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate and the same peak brightness. The slimmer profile makes it easier to slip into narrower pockets, but the 9 Pro Fold still trumps the Galaxy when it comes to ease of using the outer screen, espeically when typing. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 for the base model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Unlike some countries like India, which will only get one variant, the U.S. and the rest of the world will get a 512GB option, too, with the same amount of RAM. I like that Google increased the RAM on the new Fold, as all those AI and multitasking features should benefit from it in the long run. The 9 Pro Fold is powered by the Tensor G4 SoC, which claims to be quicker and more efficient in general and AI processing. Other hardware features include Google&apos;s Titan M2 security chip, fingerprint sensor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, Bluetooth 5.3, and dual-band GPS. </p><p>The camera sensors have also received minor updates. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s rear cameras include a 48MP wide with an f/1.7 aperture, a new 10.5MP ultrawide with a wider 127-degree field of view and autofocus for macro shots, and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom and up to 20x Super Res Zoom. The back also features a laser autofocus system and spectral and flicker sensors. </p><p>The camera on the cover display and in the folding display is the same 10MP sensor with an f/2.2 aperture. The 9 Pro Fold can shoot up to 4K 60fps videos, along with 10-bit HDR videos from the rear camera and Night Sight video. </p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s battery is smaller than its predecessor&apos;s, but it&apos;s still larger than the Fold 6. The 4,650mAh capacity can be quickly charged using Google&apos;s certified 45W optional charger. </p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at $1,899 for 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and goes up to $2,259 for the 1TB variant. It&apos;s powered by the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC, which is still the flagship chip in 2024. It&apos;ll be interesting to see how this compares to the new Tensor chip in the Pixel. Like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Fold 6 also gets Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, Ultra-Wideband support, and USB 3.2. The Galaxy has the unique advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">supporting Samsung&apos;s S Pen stylus</a>, which is a handy tool for jotting notes or sketching out ideas. </p><p>The cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 are quite versatile and good enough for everyday use, although we would have liked to see a bigger upgrade by now. The rear of the Fold 6 gets a 50MP main, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide. The cover screen has a 10MP sensor, while the folding screen uses the same 4MP under-display camera. The latter has improved since it was first introduced, but it&apos;s no match for the quality of a high-resolution sensor. </p><p>Battery life on the Fold series has generally been good, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 features a 4,400mAh battery. A day&apos;s worth of usage is something you can typically expect from this phone. Sadly, wired charging is still only 25W, and you&apos;ll need to get your own charger. Wireless charging is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-wireless-charging">supported at 15W</a>. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and is slated to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-get">seven years of software updates and security patches</a>. You also get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> baked in from the moment you set it up, which can do much more than Assitant, like generate stories for your blog, draft, and email, or help you know more about what&apos;s on your screen. Fold users will also get a one-year free subscription to Gemini Advanced via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a>, which includes 2TB of cloud storage and the ability to use Gemini in Gmail and Docs. </p><p>Google is also adding new AI features, which will be exclusive to Pixel devices. Pixel Screenshots uses Gemini Nano to remember all the details from screenshots taken on your Pixel phone, so you can simply prompt it to find what you&apos;re looking for later instead of having to dig through your pile of screenshots. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> feature for the camera app lets you add yourself to group shots if you&apos;re the one taking it by merging two photos of one with you in it and one without. Google has beefed up its multitasking capabilities, too, with Split Screen and the ability to save app pairs. You also get a taskbar with recent apps that can be pinned for quick access.</p>

<p>Samsung has now almost perfected its multitasking features for its Fold series. It allows you to open three apps at once and more in floating windows. Folding the Z Fold 6 halfway automatically rearranges the layout in some apps to offer extended functionality. There are also a ton of Galaxy AI features to play with, the most interesting one being the "Sketch to Image" feature. This lets you generate life-like images of objects and animals by simply doodling over an existing image. There are plenty more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features like live translate, as well as Google AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and much more.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 ships with Samsung&apos;s One UI skin, which is based on Android 14. Like the Pixel, it gets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-receive">seven years of OS and security updates</a>.

<p>If I were to choose between the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, the choice would be pretty easy — I&apos;d go with the Pixel. There are a couple of good reasons, too. The main one would have to be the form factor. The wider aspect ratio of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold makes it feel like a regular phone when folded, so it&apos;s easier to use, type on, and play games on it, too. Next would have to be the design. It looks more modern compared to the Fold 6, which, by now, can be mistaken for even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. Then there are those cool, exclusive Pixel AI features like Add Me, which can be extremely useful. On top of that, you can expect great things from the cameras, and you&apos;ll always be among the first to get the latest Android software. </p><p>Now that the 9 Pro Fold is here, we could see a price shuffle for the Galaxy Z Fold 6. It&apos;s still a good option for anyone looking for excellent stylus support, great gaming performance, and desktop-like computing with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>. </p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 is a powerful 12.1-inch Android tablet with the latest Snapdragon chip, OnePlus' patented fast charging and strong battery life, and a fast-refreshing display offering plenty of space for multitasking. It's missing a lot of useful intangibles, but powerful hardware at this price point is a rare thing.</p></p>

<p>While the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra had no major competition when it launched last year, its hardware is looking a little outdated compared to the Pad 2, especially since Samsung still charges an arm and a leg for one. This is still the tablet to buy if you want the most screen space possible for work, gaming, or streaming, but it's excessive for most people.</p></p>

<p>Why compare the OnePlus Pad 2 vs. Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra when the latter costs so much more? Because the Pad 2 beats Samsung&apos;s flagship Android tablet in several surprising ways, and you&apos;ll have to decide whether this mid-range device is a better option.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-costs-more-but-its-upgrades-make-it-worth-the-price">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, rebranded from the OnePlus Pad Pro released in China earlier this year, is a step up on 2023&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a>, which had strong hardware but some software downsides that put off our reviewer. The Pad 2 improves on its predecessor&apos;s hardware in key ways, while bringing in tools from its new foldable phones for better multitasking software than before.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a> numbers among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> available today, especially if you&apos;re more interested in productivity than portability. But our Senior Editor for Tablets has moved the OnePlus Pad 2 above the Ultra in our rankings, given how expensive the Ultra is. It&apos;ll be up to you to decide whether it&apos;s worth spending more for perks like DeX Mode and richer AMOLED colors.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 weighs 146g or 5.2oz less than the Ultra; it actually weighs the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9 Plus</a>, though it&apos;s 1mm thicker. Made of matte aluminum, the Nimbus Gray Pad 2 is very plain looking compared to the Halo Green, brushed-metal finish of the first Pad. Aside from the OnePlus logo, not much stands out at first glance.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra mostly stands out because of its massive size. You need a Tab S9 or S9+ for something more portable, while this is mainly designed to sit on a desk so you can tap at the display with an S Pen or use the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-tired-of-buying-new-cases">Book Cover Keyboard</a>. The back has Samsung&apos;s trademark lines etched along the edge, giving it a bit of character, but otherwise it&apos;s another matte aluminum slab; the main difference is that Samsung sells it in two colors, Graphite or Beige.</p><p>Samsung gave its Tab S9 Ultra IP68 dust and water resistance, so it can withstand any potential spills at home or on the go. The Pad 2 doesn&apos;t give you that peace of mind.</p><p>Both are designed with landscape mode in mind: the Tab S9 Ultra has a small centered notch for the dual 12MP selfie cams, while the Pad 2 has a small cut-out in the bezel for its 8MP cam. Both align their speaker grilles on the shorter edges so sound isn&apos;t cut off sitting on a desk or lap. And both have rich stereo sound, though OnePlus added two extra speakers for some extra oomph.</p><p>Both tablets support their proprietary styluses — the Samsung S Pen or the OnePlus Stylo 2 — each with less than 3ms of latency for responsive drawing. OnePlus promises 16,000 levels of pressure sensitivity compared to Samsung&apos;s 4,096, but you have to pay separately for the Stylo 2. </p><p>Also, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.parkablogs.com/pictures/oneplus-pad-2-artist-review">artist&apos;s review of the OnePlus Pad 2</a> describes issues with detecting pressure changes and drawing diagonal lines; he called Samsung&apos;s S Pen more reliable. We&apos;re still testing the Pad 2 ourselves, but we&apos;re inclined to trust his expertise.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra gives you the most screen real estate of any tablet. Its AMOLED panel gets "more than bright enough" thanks to the boosted nits over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra</a> and provides deeper blacks and richer colors than an LCD can offer. It also hits a smooth 120Hz refresh rate and supports the S Pen for stylus controls.</p><p>The OnePlus Pad 2 only delivers a 12.1-inch LCD display, helping it hit a lower price point and making it easier to hold for streaming. If you can accept the muted colors, the Pad 2 display has a dynamic 144Hz refresh rate that switches to slower speeds depending on the application to save battery. Unfortunately, OnePlus controls which apps support the highest Hz, with most defaulting to either 120Hz or 60Hz.</p><p>It also has a richer resolution, beating Samsung&apos;s by 64 pixels per inch (PPI). Smaller tablets usually have higher PPIs, but even the comparably-sized Tab S9+ is 38 PPI short. And while its peak brightness for outdoor use is 30 nits short, its standard indoor brightness wins handily.</p><p>Of the two tablets, only Samsung&apos;s display has an in-display fingerprint sensor, while OnePlus relies on facial recognition or a standard passcode. Only Samsung gave its Tab display a Gorilla Glass 5 protective layer. And even though Samsung&apos;s display notch is polarizing, it&apos;s only noticeable because the rest of the bezel is so skinny, while the Pad 2 bezel has a more industry-standard thickness.</p>

<p>OnePlus sells two versions of its Pad 2, but only the higher-end 12GB/256GB variant is available in the United States. That matches the default Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra option, and its 16GB/1TB upgrade appears to be out of stock today. Still, you can pay $120 extra to jump to 512GB of storage, and you also have a 1TB-capable microSD card slot, while OnePlus can&apos;t go higher than 256GB.</p><p>While the OnePlus Pad 1 had a MediaTek Dimensity 9000 that our reviewer complained was prone to laggy browsing, the Pad 2 uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">much more powerful benchmarks</a>, solving the issue. For comparison, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s23-series-snapdragon-8-gen-2-exclusively-win-samsung-qualcomm">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy</a>.</p><p>Both of these are flagship CPUs, with the Gen 3 winning by a small margin. If you&apos;re concerned about the best possible performance, you can check <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/SD-8-Gen-3-for-Galaxy-vs-SD-8-Gen-2-for-Galaxy-vs-SD-8-Gen-3_17413_14990_15102.247596.0.html">Notebook Check&apos;s Gen 2 for Galaxy vs. Gen 3 benchmarks</a>: they show a noticeable gap for 3DMark and Geekbench multi-core but similar Geekbench single-core, which suggests you&apos;ll mainly see a difference for demanding tasks like gaming. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FCDaubLZX5nVJUpFdrkvX7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S9-Ultra-multitasking-02.jpg" alt="Multitasking on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and using the S Pen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FCDaubLZX5nVJUpFdrkvX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>OnePlus didn&apos;t upgrade its cameras from the last version; our reviewer called the 8MP selfie cam "passable" but not especially good, and joked that you "shouldn&apos;t be taking photos with this thing at all" because the 13MP rear camera sensor is nothing special.</p><p>Samsung gave the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra dual 13MP and 8MP UW rear cameras, so your resolution for photos is going to be comparable if you bother with it — except you can take wider, lower-resolution photos if you want. What&apos;s much more important is the dual 12MP selfie cams, providing high-quality resolution and detail for video conferencing.</p><p>As for battery life, the Tab S9 Ultra&apos;s extra capacity compared to the Pad 2 is offset by the larger display. In practice, these are both long-lived tablets that should last you about 10 hours of video streaming before you need to charge them. </p><p>The key difference is that OnePlus offers a speedier 67W charging standard than Samsung&apos;s 45W, so you can refill it in about 90 minutes instead of two hours. Plus, OnePlus actually includes an 80W power adapter in the box, whereas Samsung makes you buy one for yourself.</p>

<p>Samsung promises its usual four years of OS updates and five years of security updates for the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, while OnePlus promises three OS updates and four years of security updates. Since Samsung released the Tab S9 series in August 2023, that means both tablets have the same amount of support time left.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s tablet is best known for its DeX mode. You connect a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard with trackpad to the Ultra, then use it as a makeshift laptop for Chromebook-style productivity. Our Tablets editor loves the latest version of DeX introduced with One UI 6 and feels it should be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">default for Samsung tablets</a>. That said, you can still multitask in standard Android mode, splitting apps across the screen.</p><p>Our original OnePlus Pad reviewer had beef with the software experience, but OnePlus took its experience with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> foldable to improve multitasking on the Pad 2. It has a new Open Canvas software layout that lets you float several apps across the Pad 2 space in a natural and convenient way, making it appealing for power users.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-pad-2-vs-samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus Pad 2 vs. Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra: Which should you buy?</h2>
<p>We&apos;ve heard rumors about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-series-launch-month-rumors">Galaxy Tab S10+ and S10 Ultra</a> allegedly arriving this fall, and they can&apos;t come soon enough. This Pad 2 vs. Tab S9 Ultra comparison shows that Samsung has lost a step on the competition a bit. OnePlus has its Android rival beat for performance, refresh rate, resolution, charging speed, number of speakers, and other areas while charging significantly less.</p><p>Samsung does better at certain intangibles: It bundles the S Pen, includes strong haptics (the Pad 2 has none) and a fingerprint sensor, water resistance, and richer display colors. The Ultra is still a fast and visually stunning device, and it gives you more screen space to work or play.</p><p>But considering the huge price gap between the $550 OnePlus Pad 2 and $1,200 Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, the return on investment arguably isn&apos;t enough to justify spending <em>that</em> much more, unless you&apos;re truly going to use your tablet as a laptop replacement.</p>

Especially after seeing how the Pixel Fold fell short of pretty much every other foldable phone in 2023. </p><p>Thankfully, some of that seems to be rectified as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> adopts a much more modern design. It also helps that Google&apos;s latest foldable shares the same chipset as the rest of the Pixel 9, meaning that it won&apos;t miss out on features like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> did when the Pixel 8 launched. </p><p>That being said, we&apos;re always interested in what could come next, and that trend continues with the release of a potential Pixel 10 Pro Fold. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-release-date"><span>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Release date</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eVsnkHuNg4iBG5LBwCHZaQ" name="pixel-9-pixel-watch-2-pixel-buds-pro-2-pixel-9-pro-fold-family-2.jpg" alt="Pixel 9, Pixel Watch 3, Pixel Buds 2 Pro portfolio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVsnkHuNg4iBG5LBwCHZaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It seems that Google needed a year to get its phone lineup properly aligned. Traditionally, the latest Pixel phones have been announced in September before being released sometime in October. However, the Pixel Fold arrived in June 2023, just four months before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> made their way to the market.</p><p>In 2024, Google opted for a different approach, as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was announced alongside the three other devices in the Pixel 9 lineup. However, the only difference this time is that Google decided to proceed with a staggered launch, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro XL</a> coming first, with the 9 Pro and 9 Pro Fold being released in early September. </p><p>Provided that this is the "new norm" for Google, this would set the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to be released in early September of 2025. However, we also wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the Pixel 10 lineup is pushed back into October. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-specs"><span>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kVVVZzkD7QWoXgz8CXMtSP" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-studio-app.jpg" alt="Pixel Studio app on Pixel 9 Pro Fold inner screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kVVVZzkD7QWoXgz8CXMtSP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing as we&apos;re just now getting the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, there&apos;s really not much to go on regarding specs for its successor. However, we have already seen quite a few leaks and rumors when it comes to Google&apos;s Tensor G5 chip. </p><p>Going from the Tensor G3 to the G4 wasn&apos;t exactly the generational leap we might have hoped for. Google put more of a focus in improving the AI performance, which makes sense given the improvements made to Gemini. If the rumors are to be believed, the Tensor G5 is shaping up to be more performant, and exciting. </p><p>For one, rumors suggest that Google will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-testing-tsmc-made-tensor-chips-instead-of-samsung">relying on TSMC</a>, instead of Samsung, for manufacturing of the G5. This might come as a surprise given that Google and Samsung co-developed the Tensor platform. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.13%;"><img id="ipWxaaTeDTrRnEW64JSFm" name="google-tensor-official.jpg" alt="Google Tensor Official" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipWxaaTeDTrRnEW64JSFm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="425" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the primary complaints about Google&apos;s Tensor processors has been related to overheating while still lagging behind the likes of Apple and Qualcomm. TSMC seemingly has managed to provide some relief here, as the Tensor G5 is rumored to use TSMC&apos;s 3nm process. </p><p>Along with providing better performance and efficiency, it would also put Google in line with Apple&apos;s A17 Pro SoC. Apple was the first to make use of a 3nm phone processor, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> is still made on the 4nm process. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-wishlist"><span>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Wishlist</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eEe5APmjLXtUW4vzNFmvyP" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-rear.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold rear view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eEe5APmjLXtUW4vzNFmvyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From a design standpoint, Google introduced quite a dramatic change with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold compared to the original Pixel Fold. It&apos;s now more in line with many of the best foldable phones, ditching the passport-like design in favor of something that looks more modern. That being said, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold still falls short in a few areas, so let&apos;s take a look at a few things we&apos;d like to see in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. </p>
<h2 id="cameras-worthy-of-the-price-tag-2">Cameras worthy of the price tag</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Bw7EtZCUoK6rh4g2f56hvT" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-camera-flex-mode-armchair-2.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold camera in Flex Mode on Armchair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bw7EtZCUoK6rh4g2f56hvT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you pay more than $1,000 for a smartphone, you would expect it to offer a no-compromise flagship experience. However, foldable phones released in North America often fall quite a bit short of their slab counterparts. We&apos;re willing to give Google a bit of leeway here, as the company&apos;s machine learning helps to produce stunning images from outdated camera hardware. </p><p>Even with that in mind, we&apos;re not exactly talking about the days of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review">Pixel 4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-xl-review">4 XL</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 but doesn&apos;t offer the same level of quality provided by the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL, two phones that are much less expensive. </p><p>Google prioritized the design over the cameras with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, as the company focused on a thinner phone than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open. At a bare minimum, we&apos;d hope that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold offers the same cameras as the Pixel 10 Pro, if not better. </p>
<h2 id="stylus-support-2">Stylus support</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rKj5Yn9AZqteZJ45Wqhocb" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-21.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Sketch to Image"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKj5Yn9AZqteZJ45Wqhocb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It took Samsung three generations to implement stylus support with its foldable phone. We were quietly hoping that Google&apos;s second attempt would bring stylus support, but that would&apos;ve likely resulted in a thicker device due to the additional screen layer required. </p><p>As long as Google sticks to the book-style foldable, we would love for the ability to write down notes. It&apos;s become a bit of an overlooked feature of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold</a> series, but having this capability can&apos;t be understated when you need (or want) it. </p>
<h2 id="pwm-friendly-screens-2">PWM-friendly screens</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AY9z2KWfH4w7d2XaNEsZHZ" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-vs-pixel-8-pro-pwm-enhanced.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's 480Hz PWM rate with an enhanced 3840Hz PWM rate on the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AY9z2KWfH4w7d2XaNEsZHZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You probably could have guessed that this section would be here, as it seems that most companies besides Honor don&apos;t really care about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-phones-for-pwm-flicker-sensitive">PWM rates</a>. However, it&apos;s rather unfortunate that these companies are unwilling to cater to <em>all</em> potential customers. </p><p>Although it&apos;s estimated that about 10% of people are affected by display flickering and PWM rates, that&apos;s still no excuse for those to feel as though they&apos;re being ignored. Nick Sutrich, Android Central Senior Content Producer, has been suffering from these problems for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">more than a year</a>. Because of that reason, he&apos;s unable to enjoy the spoils of using a plethora of devices. </p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s time for Google to take a page out of Honor&apos;s playbook, implementing displays like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a> that offer PWM-friendly displays. Otherwise, it&apos;s either opting for a different phone entirely or being relegated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">rooting the phone</a>, provided that a suitable kernel is available that allows you to manually adjust the PWM levels. </p>
<h2 id="is-it-time-for-a-pixel-flip-2">Is it time for a Pixel Flip?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="u8pYCxTEqdtrBuraT2pH8N" name="google-pixel-flip-mockup-fold-camera-bar.jpg" alt="Mockup of the Pixel Flip with a Fold-like camera housing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u8pYCxTEqdtrBuraT2pH8N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With two iterations of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-foldable-phones">foldable phones</a> under its belt, it might be time for Google to expand its lineup of Pixel phones even further. Book-style foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold are arguably more versatile, but sales numbers suggest foldable flip phones are more popular.</p><p>Not everyone needs or wants a phone that doubles as a foldable tablet in their bag or pocket. Instead, there are many who prefer having a slab phone that folds in half. This is especially true as companies like Samsung, Motorola, and others figure out different ways to improve the usability of the outer cover screen. </p><p>Google introducing a Pixel Flip would help to squash any potential concerns about the company being committed to the foldable space. While at the same, providing another option to compete with the likes of Samsung and Motorola. We just hope that a potential Pixel Flip wouldn&apos;t mean the end of the Pixel Fold. </p>

<hr>
<p>Many years ago, cable and satellite TV customers flocked to streaming services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix">Netflix </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon">Amazon Prime</a>, leaving their set-top boxes and expensive contracts behind. For a time, the streaming landscape was indeed better than cable. That isn&apos;t true anymore, because the streaming market has been flooded with too many options and anti-consumer media licensing battles. </p><p>If you&apos;re tired of streaming services, be prepared to start seeing a brand new one: Chick-Fil-A wants you to get your fast-food fill and your original video content from the same company. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/chick-fil-a-hatches-streaming-service-1236044196/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reported last week that Chick-Fil-A is trying to shore up original content ahead of the launch of its rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv">streaming service</a>. The fast food chain is reportedly working with multiple major production companies and studios to develop unscripted, game-show-style TV shows. </p><p>While much of the content is said to be unscripted, some scripted content could be in the works. Deadline also says that Chick-Fil-A is having conversations about licensing and acquiring the rights to existing content, which would then be hosted on this new streaming service. Specifically, the outlet says that a family-friendly gameshow has already received a ten-episode order from Chick-Fil-A. </p><p>It might seem surprising that Chick-Fil-A is breaking into the video streaming market, but who isn&apos;t these days? We&apos;ve already seen shows from Lyft, Airbnb, and others. While fast food chains haven&apos;t been known to foray into streaming services, they&apos;re exploring the technology industry as much as any other company. Mobile ordering, data collection, and automation have been hot topics in the fast food industry in recent years. </p><p>The real question to ask is this one: do we really <em>need</em> a Chick-Fil-A streaming service? For 99% of people, I suspect the answer is decidedly no. We already have too many streaming services, and the content many of us enjoy is already scattered across multiple video platforms. In fact, I&apos;d reason that there are many more people laughing about this development from Chick-Fil-A than there are excited about it. </p><p>It&apos;s no joke when companies with barely any tech experience jump into the industry. It can lead to serious problems, and we&apos;ve already seen some of those issues pop up.</p>
<h2 id="we-apos-re-already-seeing-the-consequences-of-companies-trying-tech-on-a-whim-2">We&apos;re already seeing the consequences of companies trying tech on a whim</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UoGCi6MUR4WRFuxRTcmwx5" name="disney-plus-app-logo-on-tv.jpg" alt="The Disney Plus TV app and logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UoGCi6MUR4WRFuxRTcmwx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For starters, the amount of bandwidth and servers needed to service a video streaming platform is more than you&apos;d expect unless you&apos;ve tried to do it. It&apos;s likely that Chick-Fil-A is underestimating the technical infrastructure required to host a streaming service, even if it&apos;s outsourcing most of it. Plus, all the investments Deadline is reporting now are being made for original content and licensing deals, not the service itself. </p><p>The more concerning thing to me is the security of Chick-Fil-A&apos;s platform. Historically, companies that aren&apos;t tech-first tend to leave user data vulnerable to hackers and data breaches. For example, in early 2024, McDonald&apos;s suffered a major data breach that leaked customer and employee names, emails, internal tools, and bank logs, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thecyberexpress.com/mcdonalds-data-breach-surfaces-on-dark-web/" target="_blank">The Cyber Express</a>. While Chick-Fil-A already stores user data related to its mobile app, a streaming service increases the likelihood that credit card and payment information will be saved and is potentially at risk. </p><p>No company is immune from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/atandt-data-breach-compromised-phone-records-of-nearly-all-its-customers">data breaches</a>. However, when you trust a company like Apple or Google with your personal data, you know they&apos;ve been doing this for decades and will take measures to protect your information. You might share data with the Apples and Googles of the world that you wouldn&apos;t with a startup. </p><p>The problem with Chick-Fil-A, and companies like it, entering the tech space is simple. You trust the brand and are familiar with it because you&apos;ve seen it before or you&apos;ve been a customer, but in reality, Chick-Fil-A is no better than a startup in the tech space. The experience of making fast food doesn&apos;t transfer to hosting user accounts, credit card information, or video streaming. </p><p>Disney+ introduced a whole new cause for concern, too. Disney originally tried to have a wrongful death lawsuit tossed out of court because the plaintiff signed up for a Disney+ free trial and agreed to an arbitration clause. The company argued that this clause applied to Disney Springs restaurants completely unrelated to Disney+. As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/disney-allergy-death-lawsuit-b66cd07c6be2497bf5f6bce2d1f2e8d1" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> reports, Disney backed down in response to public pressure. But it leaves us wondering: would it have worked? By agreeing to terms and conditions for a Chick-Fil-A streaming service, could those be used against us while eating a chicken sandwich?</p><p>We have no idea how Chick-Fil-A would operate a streaming service. I&apos;ve brought up prior examples of what can happen when you trust a company without major experience in tech with your data, and these are worth considering. The next time a trusted brand throws their hat in the ring when it comes to technology, think twice before you trust it. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest beta version of Google Play services hints at a drag-and-drop feature for Quick Share, similar to what’s already available on Windows.</li><li>Currently, Quick Share doesn’t support drag-and-drop on larger Android devices like tablets and foldables.</li><li>The feature was showcased in a demo, but it's still in development and files aren’t transferring yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s Quick Share, the Android version of Apple&apos;s AirDrop, is set to get a big upgrade that could make sharing files on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> a lot easier.</p><p>Recent insights from the beta version of Google Play services, courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/drag-drop-quick-share-tablets-3474976/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, hint at a new drag-and-drop feature coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-nearby-share-your-android-phone">Quick Share on Android</a>. It looks like it’ll work much like the current Quick Share experience on Windows.</p><p>Although Google&apos;s Quick Share has made it easier to transfer files between devices, it doesn&apos;t work the same across all platforms. While you can drag and drop files on Windows with Quick Share, this handy capability is still missing on larger Android devices like tablets and foldables.</p><p>But an APK teardown of the latest Google Play Services beta (24.34.32) shows that Google is working on adding drag-and-drop capability to Quick Share.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Quick Share is a handy app that makes it easy to transfer files between devices wirelessly. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">works across Android phones, tablets, Chromebooks, and Windows PCs</a>, offering a great option for those who don’t use Apple products.</p><p>But people using tablets and foldable devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/how-to-drag-and-drop-between-apps-on-android-tablets">currently have to go through a few steps to share files on Android</a>—selecting the files, tapping the Share button, and then choosing from the sharesheet, which includes Quick Share among other options. So, adding a simple drag-and-drop gesture would make file sharing on larger screens much easier and more intuitive.</p><p>More importantly, the upcoming drag-and-drop capability will help close the gap between Android and Windows, giving Android users a level of ease similar to what Windows users enjoy.</p><p>While Android Authority got the feature up and running and gave a demo of what it can do, it&apos;s not fully operational yet. The video shows that users can drag multiple files to the recipient&apos;s name, but the files aren’t actually transferring at this stage.</p>
