<p>This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape.</p><p>This week, Google gave us our first taste of Android 16 with the developer preview for Pixel phones, the DOJ is proposing that Google sells Chrome to break up its monopoly, OPPO launched the Find X8 series running the latest MediaTek chip, Google may be looking to develop a Pixel Laptop with a twist, and a new Garmin smartwatch just leaked.</p>

The update, which is expected to hit stable in Q2 2025, doesn't brings a handful of notable changes and features, including notification cooldown, audio sharing (which first appeared in the Android 15 beta), an improved desktop mode, and more.</p><p>Newer Pixel phones are eligible for the update, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-supports-the-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-heres-why-it-matters">surprisingly includes the Pixel 6 series</a>, which ended support for OS upgrades in October. It's a good sign that suggest there's a possibility that they will get the official Android 16 update, but Google could always change its mind. That also goes for any potential features found in the update.</p><p>Since it's the first developer preview, things are bound to be very glitchy, so we don't recommend installing it unless you're a developer and/or know what you're doing.</p>

As a significant part of Google's suite of apps and services, Google has understandably taken issue with this proposal, publishing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/">blog post</a> about how the "staggering" proposal would "harm consumers."</p><p>"DOJ’s proposal would literally require us to install not one but two separate choice screens before you could access Google Search on a Pixel phone you bought," says Kent Walker, Google's president of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer, explaining that a proposed Technical Committee would hold hold "enormous power" over the online experience.</p><p>The blog post outlines a number of ways the proposal would "break" a range of Google's products, stating that it would create a worse experience for consumers. Android Central senior editor Jerry Hildenbrand also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">explains</a> how selling Chrome may not work as well as the DOJ hopes. In response, Walker says Google will offer its own proposals next month.</p>

The OPPO Find X8 and Find X8 Pro are nearly identical, although the standard model has a smaller 6.6-inch OLED display and a 5630mAh battery. The Pro model sports a 6.78-inch OLED display and a 5910mAh battery.</p><p>Furthermore, the Find X8 has three 50MP cameras while the Find X8 Pro has four, with an additional periscope telephoto lens for 6x optical zoom.</p><p>Both phones are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">MediaTek Dimensity 9400</a>, which competes directly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and offers a new NPU with 80% faster LLM prompts and 100% more performant diffusion generation. You get a choice of 12 or 16GB of RAM with the X8, while the X8 Pro is only offered with 16GB. There's also support for magnetic charging, but you'll need a separate case for that.</p><p>For our impressions on OPPO's latest flagship, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">OPPO Find X8 Pro review</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/alleged-google-pixel-laptop-early-report"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>There are a few rumors going around about Google's plans in the near future, which may no longer include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-future-pixel-tablet-cancellation-rumors">Pixel Tablet 2</a>. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html">one rumor</a> points to what could be a Pixel Laptop, and it may not run ChromeOS as we would expect. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">Mishaal Rahman</a>, Google is working on a "multi-year project to fully turn Chrome OS into Android."</p><p>Google already seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chromeos-is-undergoing-major-changes-and-lacros-is-the-first-casualty">laying down the groundwork</a> to make this happen, as it recently started merging "portions of the Android stack, like the Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks, as part of the foundation of ChromeOS." This is apparently being done to accelerate development, particularly with AI features. Still, that won't be ready for "quite some time."</p><p>As for the Pixel Laptop, it seems it may be a high-end Android device that is meant to compete more with the likes of the iPad. Only time will tell if the rumors of a laptop are true and whether it will indeed be able to adequately compete.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-leaks-im-hoping-for-two-major-changes"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>It's been a minute since Garmin launched the last Instinct model, but we may not be waiting long for a new one. A Reddit post seems to show what's allegedly the Garmin Instinct 3, with what looks like an MIP two-window display. There's also an indicator under the display noting that it's a solar watch, which can help extend the battery life thanks to the built-in solar panel overlay.</p><p>The design resembles a somewhat sleeker Instinct Crossover, but the image clearly shows "Garmin Instinct 3" on the bottom. For now, it's unclear if the image is really the Garmin Instinct 3, but it wouldn't be the first time the watch has been spotted, so we'll see. It may not appeal to many athletes like other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> do, but the rugged design and solar capability may appeal to the more outdoorsy types.</p>

I got back to using its products recently, and I can see why the brand outsells its rivals — the 737 power Bank in particular is one of the best you can get today, with the power bank offering three ports and a massive 24,000mAh battery.</p><p>The power bank debuted for $149 last year, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z">now on sale for just $79</a>, its lowest price yet. Pricing data for 2024 shows that it went down to $109 in sporadic bursts this year, but the Black Friday deal on this power bank makes it an instant recommendation if you&apos;re looking to pick one up.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="221bce3d-e466-444d-9fad-254e91bda332" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$79 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$79 at Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="gfCfndzjdd52vzD8GoLW6X" name="Anker-737-GaNPrime-Power-bank-square.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gfCfndzjdd52vzD8GoLW6X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anker 737 24,000mAh 140W Power Bank:</strong> <del><strong>$149</strong></del> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z" data-dimension112="221bce3d-e466-444d-9fad-254e91bda332" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$79 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$79 at Amazon"><strong>$79 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Anker makes the best power banks, and this model is its best yet. It has dual USB-C ports and a USB-A port, has a built-in screen that shows real-time charging stats, and goes up to 140W over USB PD 3.1 via the USB-C ports. I test dozens of power banks over the course of the year, and the 737 is the one you should get — particularly now that it's just $79.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="221bce3d-e466-444d-9fad-254e91bda332" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$79 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$79 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>There&apos;s plenty to like with the 737 Power Bank. The 24,000mAh battery is big enough to charge all your tech — including a notebook and two phones — without any issues. There are dual USB-C ports based on the USB PD 3.1 standard, and each port goes up to 140W, making it a great choice to charge MacBooks and other notebooks. What&apos;s also great is that the internal battery also charges at 140W — provided you use a charger that goes up to 140W (I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-GaNPrime-Compact-Foldable/dp/B09W2PNLX7">recommend this one</a>).</p><p>I also like that there&apos;s an LCD panel that shows real-time charging details. This is particularly handy if you&apos;re on the go and need to see how long it will take to charge your device. There&apos;s a USB-A port as well, and you can easily charge three devices at once, with 18W going to USB-A, and 122W split amongst the two USB-C ports.</p><p>You get a 140W USB-C to USB-C cable bundled in the package, and the design of the power bank makes it easy to throw in a bag or use at your desk. There isn&apos;t anything missing here, and given what you&apos;re getting, the 737 Power Bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z">is a steal at $79</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Pixel phones feature an At a Glance widget that smartly shows the information you need, when you need it.</li><li>Google appears to be working on a new At a Glance mode that will show live sports scores on your home screen.</li><li>This functionality could give Pixels a competing feature to the iPhone's Dynamic Island, which can already be used to show live sports scores.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>At a Glance</strong> widget is a staple of Google Pixel home screens, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-launcher-default-search-engine-picker-spotted">even if it's now removable</a>. That's because it's a fairly unobtrusive, but useful widget. It smartly switches what information is displayed on your screen based on your habits, the time of day, and the status of your smart home devices. However, the At a Glance home screen widget could be gaining the ability to show sports scores, according to an APK teardown from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/22/pixel-at-a-glance-sports/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The folks over at 9to5Google unpacked version 13 of Android System Intelligence, the app that handles a ton of your phone's smart features, including At a Glance. In it, the team found a handful of code strings indicating that the widget could one day "show sports updates" on Pixel home and lock screens. Here's the full section of  code relating to sports cores in At a Glance:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name=”echo_smartspace_pref_sports_key”>gemini_space_sports_score</string> 
<string name=”echo_smartspace_sports_toggle_subtitle”>Show sports updates from %1$s. These might affect battery life.</string> 
<string name=”echo_smartspace_sports_toggle_title”>Sports</string> 
<string name=”echo_smartspace_sports_toggle_subtitle_provider_name”>Google</string></code></pre>
<p>As spotted by 9to5Google, the code strings reference <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> rather than Google Assistant. This could be a precursor to Google shifting the At a Glance widget to become part of the Gemini suite. It wouldn't exactly be a surprise, since Google is clearly shifting away from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> and toward Gemini. Additionally, it's possible that Gemini could factor in some other way, like providing summaries of big plays or game recaps.</p><p>The potential addition of sports scores to the Add a Glance widget could be a big win for Android, and more specifically, Pixel. Apple has been pushing into the sports industry aggressively of late, buying the media rights to Major League Soccer games, debuting an Apple Sports app, and showing live scores through the Dynamic Island on iPhone. By including sports scores in At a Glance, Google could help Pixels become one step closer to matching the iPhone's live sports capabilities.</p><p>However, it's important to note that this feature is clearly still in development and may never ship. If it does debut on Pixel phones, it could be a top feature for sports fans.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is sending a minor update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta testers as it gears up to release Android 15 QPR1 publicly next month. The update, Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gxhqu3/android_15_qpr1_beta_31_now_available/" target="_blank">announced</a> today in a Reddit post. It includes bug fixes and improves overall stability, and is available for Google Pixel 6 and newer phones, plus the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>.</p><p>For users enrolled in the Android Beta Program, the update will be sent automatically over-the-air. The build number for Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 is <strong>AP41.240925.012</strong>. However, Google notes that users will only get this update if they're enrolled in the beta program and are still running Android 15 QPR1. Those that have updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-1-pixel-test-start">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a>, or manually flashed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a>, won't need Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gxhqu3/android_15_qpr1_beta_31_now_available">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>There are no known new features or major changes in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, and that's not surprising, as beta testers are already looking ahead to Android 15 QPR2. However, there are a few bug fixes that will be appreciated by anyone still on Android 15 QPR1. That includes a fix for NFC payment failures, a problem that has plagued various pre-release versions of Android 15 for months.</p><p>Here are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes-qpr1" target="_blank">full release notes</a> for Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, provided by Google:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where tapping media controls closed the notification shade but didn't open the app. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/375447625">Issue #375447625</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue where long pressing the device entry icon didn't work when there were many notifications and the notification shelf was overlapping the lock icon. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/369316295">Issue #369316295</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented proper volume control for some Bluetooth devices. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/376650439">Issue #376650439</a>,<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/373681731">Issue #373681731</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the Material You, wallpaper-derived color options to be very similar. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/378507373">Issue #378507373</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the scrollbar in the system settings to be sized and styled inconsistently. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/366278155">Issue #366278155</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused NFC payments to fail. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/363914347">Issue #363914347</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue where translations in Indonesian and Hebrew didn't display correctly for apps that are targeting Android 14 (API level 34) or lower. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/378200084">Issue #378200084</a>)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, camera, connectivity, localization, accessibility, and interactivity.</li></ul>
<p>This appears to be simply a quick tune-up for Android 15 QPR1 as Google prepares to release it publicly. It's largely the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-3-bluetooth-foldable-update">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3</a>, plus the bug fixes, which was the last QPR1 beta release that hit testers nearly a month ago.</p>

<p>Outside of fitness trackers, you'll also find some Black Friday Fitbit deals on its smartwatches: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Fitness-Smartwatch-Included/dp/B0B4MV1TGL"><strong>Fitbit Sense 2 is $179.95 ($70 off)</strong></a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4MWCFV4"><strong>Fitbit Versa 4 is $119.95 ($80 off)</strong></a>. Both watches have technically fallen lower <em>once</em> in their deal history — the Versa 4 at $104 and the Sense 2 at $139 — but they're both at the <em>second-lowest</em> price we've ever seen.</p><p>Because Google has all but confirmed that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">won't make any more Fitbit-branded watches</a>, focusing on the expensive, short-lived, and Android-only Pixel Watches, the Sense 2 and Versa 4 are the best you're going to get, as long as they remain in stock. But despite its age, the Sense 2 remains an excellent option for health tracking paired with a gorgeous AMOLED display, while the Versa 4 is more stripped down but very affordable at this price.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is objectively better than the Watch 6, but I know that most people deal-hunting on Black Friday prefer lower prices whenever possible. If I had to choose between the Watch 7 44mm for $247 or the Watch 6 44mm for $159, I'd lean towards the last-gen model.</p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> in its smaller size, I'd recommend paying a little extra for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C7929YMK"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6 44mm at $159.99 (52% off)</strong></a>, another all-time low! The display jump from 1.3- to 1.5-inches makes a huge visual difference without weighing much more, and while the 40mm only has Black models left, the 44mm is available in both Black and Silver, giving you more options.</p><p>Out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a>, the Galaxy Watch 6 is still on my list, despite the Watch 7 supplanting it, because of its longevity: It just received Wear OS 5 and will get three more system updates by 2027. Unlike other old, cheap watches, the Watch 6 will keep getting new Galaxy AI tricks and app smarts for <em>years</em>.</p><p>I'll admit that I'd miss the Watch 7's dual-band GPS tracking, but that's only because I'm a regular runner who's greedy for the most accurate stats possible. "Normal" people can happily make do with the Galaxy Watch 6, which still has all the Samsung Health tricks and third-party Wear OS apps like Strava that you need to train and get (or stay) healthy!</p><p>While I personally love my Pixel Watch 3 as a Wear OS alternative, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D91268TH"><strong>early Black Friday deal of $329 ($70 off)</strong></a> isn't nearly as impressive. Only the Galaxy Watch 6 and 7 deals are especially kind to your wallet, and the Watch 6 in particular isn't likely to last very long! You can be patient on the newer watches, but this watch might very well sell out for good while you wait for something better.</p>

Once known as bass-heavy and fashion-first headphones, I'm happy to report that Beats are good now. With the same Apple tech inside as AirPods, plus full Android support, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4</a> and Beats Studio Pro are some of the best-value headphones you can buy.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a comfortable, light pair of headphones; you value versatility with iOS and Android fast-pairing, plus a 3.5mm jack; you want premium features like Spatial and Lossless Audio, ANC, and transparency mode.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the absolute best sound quality; you don't like the plastic construction of the Beats Studio Pro.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about the Beats Studio Pro is that the headphones share a lot of similarities with the AirPods Max, which retail for $549.99. I've tested both extensively, and I won't lie to you — the AirPods Max do sound better, and have better ANC. When I think about <em>how much</em> better the AirPods Max sound than the Beats Studio Pro, that's when things start to change. I don't think the AirPods Max are $400 better than the Beats Studio Pro, and that's roughly the price difference between these two headphones when you consider the $159.99 deal price of the Studio Pro.</p><p>So, with the Beats Studio Pro, you're getting about 90% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-airpods-max-work-android-phones">AirPods Max</a> experience at a fraction of the price. The Beats Studio Pro still have a custom Beats chip facilitating quick, snappy connection with both iOS and Android. There's also solid active noise-canceling, transparency mode, and support for Dolby Atmos, Lossless Audio, and Spatial Audio. Plus, you get a 3.5mm jack for when you want to use a cable.</p><p>Now, the Beats Studio Pro aren't the only pair of Beats headphones on sale. Budget buyers will probably want to grab the Solo 4 instead, which are half off for a limited time, bringing the price down to $99.99. Target lists the deal as ending tomorrow, so you'll want to act fast to secure this discount.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a basic, cheap pair of wireless on-ear headphones; you want a pair of headphones that'll stay secure on your head during workouts; you need fast-pairing with iOS and Android; you want a 3.5mm jack.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need ANC and transparency mode; you find on-ear headphones uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The Beats Solo 4 aren't perfect, but it's easy to accept a compromise or two when the headphones are available for just under $100. There's no ANC or transparency mode support, which is a big bummer. But they have solid sound, long battery life, and a reliable connection with iOS and Android quick pairing. Strong clamping force helps the Beats Solo 4 become my top recommendation for on-ear workout headphones. These won't fall off while you're lifting weights or going for a run.</p><p>Black Friday hasn't even officially started yet, and Beats already has a discount for everyone. Not looking to spend a lot on a new pair of headphones? Pick up the Beats Solo 4. Want a premium experience at a midrange price? There's the Beats Studio Pro.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp has announced a new Voice Message Transcripts feature for select languages.</li><li>The aim is to help users with transcripts when they cannot hear the received voice notes in select situations.</li><li>WhatsApp also notes that it can help comprehend longer voice notes more easily.</li><li>The global rollout in select languages is to happen in the coming weeks, with the promise of adding more languages soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you are a WhatsApp user, chances are you already know how voice notes work on the messaging platform. It is a handy functionality for sharing quick voice messages instead of typing long texts, and it is now getting a nifty new expansion.</p><p>WhatsApp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-voice-message-transcripts">has announced</a> that it is introducing voice message transcripts for users who often send voice notes to their friends and family. The Meta-owned company notes that although the voice message itself adds a personal touch compared to a regular text message, in certain scenarios, like when in a loud place or at a concert, it can be difficult to hear a voice message.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nzGKSzJZVLxHZdmKzEzscj" name="whatspp-voice-message-transcripts-02" alt="WhatsApp Voice Message Transcripts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzGKSzJZVLxHZdmKzEzscj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In such cases, these newly introduced voice message transcripts aim to save time. Additionally, having transcripts of longer voice notes will be handy for comprehending or getting back to them later. WhatsApp is also adding its privacy aspect to the transcripts, as they are generated on your device so that no one, including WhatsApp, can “hear or read your personal messages.”</p><p>The transcripts feature is also optional and can be manually enabled or turned off entirely. The messaging platform users can head to <strong>WhatsApp Settings> Chats> Voice message transcripts</strong> to enable or disable the feature in their preferred language. Once the feature is enabled, users can long-press the voice message and tap on “transcribe,” and the transcript can be viewed instantly.</p>

<p>The latest addition is believed to be rolling out globally in the coming weeks, with select languages for the start, and more languages are likely to be added in the coming months. WhatsApp has provided a little <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/241617298315321/?cms_platform=android">how-to guide</a> and has listed the languages currently supported by the new transcripts feature. They include English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian.</p><p>Meanwhile, WhatsApp has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-whatsapp-message-drafts-rollout">introduced</a> other nifty features to keep up with the competition. These include the ability to have messages in drafts, which can be sent later to chats, just like email.</p><p>Some WhatsApp users are also seeing new typing indicators from the recipients within the chat. The rollout appears to be on the server side. It appears to be an expansion of what users are already accustomed to. Previously, users could see a Typing indicator right under the contact name.</p>

<ul><li>A report states the EU could have Amazon in its sights in 2025 for a potential investigation into its marketplace practices.</li><li>The EU may look into whether or not Amazon is guilty of not pushing its products and the competition's equally.</li><li>Amazon could face a fine worth up to 10% of its "global annual turnover."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon might find itself in the hot seat again in the EU over a reported "breach in tech rules."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-likely-face-investigation-under-eu-tech-rules-next-year-sources-say-2024-11-21/">Reuters</a>, the EU might seek out Amazon to investigate an apparent DMA ruleset breach in 2025. What the EU is reportedly looking to learn is whether Amazon has pushed its own products to consumers more than the competition's.</p><p>Murmurings about a potential investigation started in March, per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/eu-investigate-apple-google-meta-potential-digital-markets-act-breaches-2024-03-25/">previous Reuters report</a>. Back then, it was stated that the EU could look into the "ranking practices" Amazon conducts on its marketplace and whether that falls outside of the boundaries set forth by the EU.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson said in March that the company has remained "compliant" with the set rules. The report states that Amazon "does not differentiate" between its products and those sold by third parties.</p><p>Now, the publication cites those close to the matter in saying that Amazon could face a fine worth up to 10% of its "global annual turnover."</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Amazon about this potential investigation. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>In September 2023, the European Commission named its first six "gatekeepers" under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-apple-imessage-gatekeeper-ruling">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>. Additionally, 22 services were deemed fit to fall under the "Core Platform" umbrella. In short, the DMA is the EU's ruleset for major companies to ensure that healthy competition lives on. One company shouldn't give itself an unfair advantage over another that's trying to make good on its platform.</p><p>Amazon's Marketplace fell within the EU's "intermediation" box for the DMA. As Reuters also reiterated, this was designed to ensure Amazon — like many others — couldn't promote themselves above others in the name of profit.</p><p>This also isn't the first time Amazon has fallen in the hot seat with the EU or even the FTC, for that matter. The company was forced to provide a clear process for consumers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-prime-updated-cancellation-process-europe">cancel its Prime membership</a> in the EU. The old process was dubbed "manipulative" as consumers found it difficult to navigate the process, thus incurring another monthly charge. After complying, Amazon rolled out a simpler, two-step process to exit the membership.</p><p>A similar investigation took place in the U.S. in 2023 as the FTC said Amazon conducted "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-sues-amazon-unfair-prime-charges">dark digital practices</a>."</p>

<ul><li>A Google app beta discovery suggests Gemini Live could grab an "Ask about this video" feature for YouTube.</li><li>Findings suggest this will let users hold a conversation, with follow-up questions, about the currently playing YouTube video.</li><li>YouTube detailed a test of its own "conversational AI" in its mobile app that would let users "Ask" about the video.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent beta suggests Google is working on a more conversational experience with Gemini during your downtime.</p><p>Strings of code in the v15.46.31.ve.arm64 of the Google app's beta tease a new experience between Gemini Live and YouTube. Discovered by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-conversation-mode-3500632/">Android Authority</a>), Google might roll out a "conversation mode" for the AI model when watching videos. A line of code directly mentions this feature's teamwork with YouTube; however, there's more to it.</p><p>The tipster was able to produce a small portion of the feature in the beta, showcasing what users might see. The provided image shows that producing Gemini's overlay may soon feature an "Ask about this video" chip. Speculation suggests this will open users up to an ongoing conversation with Gemini about the video's contents.</p><p>Users can reportedly ask about what's in the video with the opportunity to offer follow-up questions, too.</p><p>It's unclear if users can verbally say their query or if typing is the only way forward. Despite little else discoverable, another line of code encourages users to raise their device's volume "to hear Gemini."</p>

<p>While this feature seems like a likely next step after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, Gemini Live's alleged feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-highlights-premium-features-coversational-ai">looks like YouTube's</a>. A year ago, YouTube started an AI experiment with Premium users that let them playtest a conversational experience. That test included two features: AI-powered summaries for comments and a new "Ask" button for videos.</p><p>The latter was featured with a Gemini-esque star beside the Share and Like buttons under a video. Upon interaction, testers were greeted with three query suggestions: "Summarize this video," "Tell me more about this topic," and "Recommend related content."</p><p>While it <em>seems </em>like Gemini Live will lack the summarization portion, it will at least let users query about piqued their interest. Moreover, users could continue to "Ask" YouTube about the video they were watching, which is (kind of) like putting forth a follow-up question.</p><p>Aside from its official dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-on-iphone-dedicated-app-launch">app launch on iOS</a>, Gemini Live was rumored to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-could-soon-start-messing-around-with-your-files">file management capabilities</a> through Google Drive.</p>
