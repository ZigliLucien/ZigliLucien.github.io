<p>I&apos;ve spent the last year gently bashing Samsung for not taking fitness as seriously as its rivals. The Unpacked reveal that the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra had revamped HR accuracy and dual-band GPS dialed up my hype for the watches to 11, but I needed to test these upgrades for myself. Two days of running later, I&apos;m extremely optimistic!</p><p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> review unit arrived on a 102ºF Thursday afternoon, so my testing time was limited to the last two sweaty mornings (I&apos;m writing this on Saturday). I&apos;ll have more in-depth testing in about 1.5 weeks, but I wanted to rush this out for anyone considering preordering a Watch 7 or Ultra.</p><p>There are four main upgrades from the Watch 6 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and Ultra: faster Exynos, doubled storage, tripled LEDs in the bottom health sensors, and dual-band GPS. The first two are welcome but predictable for an annual upgrade, while the last two&apos;s value is somewhat subjective. Are the old Watch 6 HR and GPS data good enough that you can wait to upgrade, or do Wear OS athletes <em>need</em> the upgrade?</p>

<p>To test their accuracy, I ran wearing the Galaxy Watch Ultra on my left wrist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> on my right, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a> on my arm synced to the Garmin for more accurate HR results. </p><p>The Garmin watch was set to SatIQ mode, which starts with GPS-only to save battery but jumps into dual-band mode if the signal encounters blockage. In theory, the Galaxy Watch Ultra stays in dual-band mode by default, which would be more reliable. </p>

<p>My first 5K jogging loop ended with both Garmin and Samsung tracking 3.11 miles with a 159 bpm heart rate average. It was a great start, though the chart above does show a couple of heart rate gaps where Samsung over- or underestimated my effort that balanced out. The GPS map shows Garmin (blue) sticking more to my path, while Samsung (orange) drifted more into the street throughout the loop.</p>

<p>My second five-mile run ended with the Galaxy Watch Ultra tracking 5.04 miles and a 145 bpm average. The Garmin Forerunner 965 measured 5.01 miles and the COROS HRM measured 146 bpm.</p><p>In this test, the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s dual-band GPS map did better than Garmin&apos;s SatIQ map. On an out-and-back route, Samsung stuck more consistently to the running path while Garmin drifted outwards off the path. And at one early point where I was running in the street past some construction, Samsung better captured the moment where I stopped and turned to watch cars go by.</p><p>As for heart rate, Samsung mostly matched the HR monitor&apos;s peaks and valleys but lagged slightly behind during rapid changes. This is pretty consistent for wrist-based optical HR data, so Samsung is in good company. Aside from a couple of blips, the Ultra stayed close in accuracy.</p>

<p>To close things off, I did a quick one-mile run in lane 2 of a track to test Galaxy Watch Ultra accuracy at max effort. In this case, Samsung measured 1,670m, while the exact distance was 1,640m; the Ultra&apos;s 171bpm average was 6 bpm short of the COROS HRM.</p><p>You&apos;ll immediately notice the heart rate issues at the start of my run. I attribute it to taking my watch off for photos before the run and not making it tight enough; it wobbled as I pumped my arms until I tightened it during the first lap, and the results improved (though not immediately). Even so, the Galaxy Watch Ultra results were off by about 5–8 bpm at various points before getting fully on track during the last lap.</p><p>The GPS map was a bit nuts, but I&apos;ve yet to find <em>any</em> fitness watch that perfectly matches my lane during a track run, so I wouldn&apos;t read too much into it.</p>

<p>Overall, my GPS results were significantly better than what I got during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-fitness-hands-on">last year&apos;s Galaxy Watch 6 fitness test</a>; my heart rate results were better, but I want to do more anaerobic workouts to see if the track run issues were a fluke.</p><p>As a side note, Samsung&apos;s step count was a bit wonky. It was almost exact when I walked 1,000 steps while counting, but I suspect it misses some steps while you&apos;re running. My cadence (steps per minute) was off by a few spm in every run, and my daily Ultra step count was about 100 steps short of the Forerunner 965 for every few thousand steps. Garmin watches have won <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">several</a> of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">step-counting tests</a>, so I trust its data more here.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 7 have the same dual-band GPS and revamped HR LEDs, so you should get better fitness results than last-gen Galaxy Watches, regardless of which you choose.</p><p>Focusing specifically on the Galaxy Watch Ultra, I wrote earlier this week that I&apos;m <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">disappointed the Ultra has an inactive crown</a>. I love having a dedicated button to pause or restart workouts, only to be annoyed when I have to swipe multiple times to change screens, even when I try to wipe the sweat off my fingers. It&apos;s not a major issue, but I&apos;ll hold out hope that Samsung makes it a proper crown for future Ultras.</p><p>Samsung sent me the bulkier Ocean band, when I&apos;d have preferred the nylon Trail band to shed some weight and fit the Ultra more neatly to my wrist. My arm has gotten trained for heavy fitness watches over the years, so I didn&apos;t find the Galaxy Watch Ultra too onerous to wear; that said, people with smaller wrists will want to try one on first and see if they agree.</p>

<p>I love the jump to 3,000 nits of brightness on the display. Like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, colors remain vibrant and text readable in sunny conditions. </p><p>Samsung told us that the Galaxy Watch Ultra can last 16 hours in normal conditions with full GPS. I started my run with the Ultra at full charge and ended at 85% after two cumulative hours of running and auto-tracked walking. That would theoretically put the Ultra on pace to last 13 hours, which isn&apos;t too far short of Samsung&apos;s promise.</p><p>If nothing changes in future tests, the Galaxy Watch Ultra (or more affordable Galaxy Watch 7) will easily join the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> out there. Samsung still has a way to go on the software side—I&apos;d love to see training load or recommended workouts in future Wear OS updates—but for hardware, it&apos;s caught up to the competition.</p>

<p>This is Android Central&apos;s News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week&apos;s most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. </p><p>This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Samsung Unpacked</a> several of its devices in Paris, starting off with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold and Z Filp 6</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Buds 3 and 3 Pro</a>, and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-7"> Galaxy Watch 7</a> series. While this launch may have taken the spotlight in terms of news, here are some other things that went down in the tech world. </p><p>Starting off, the XR headset that will be launched this year, the new Galaxy watch series could be missing a feature, Google suspends support for Lollipop, OnePlus devices leak ahead of its summer event, and a new feature could let you search the dark web. Let&apos;s dive in.</p>

January&apos;s Unpacked gave us the Galaxy Ring, while the mid-year event ended with a swift mention of the Samsung XR headset. </p><p>Samsung surprised us on stage by stating that "a new XR platform is coming later this year." While we didn&apos;t get to see any image of the device, we&apos;ve been speculating about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">XR headset</a>. The company was allegedly planning its debut in the summer of 2025, but it looks like we&apos;ll get to see it in action sometime in the next five months. </p><p>All we know for now is that Samsung headsets are still in the early development stages. Samsung&apos;s headset might be more than just for gaming, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, but we expect full Google Play Store access with all the apps included in it. Samsung also wants to make its XR device more affordable— to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-apple-vision-pro-competitor-price-rumor">one-third the price</a> of the Vision Pro might cost around $1,000.</p>

In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_1280625322831715236&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fae%2Fsupport%2Fmobile-devices%2Fabout-the-galaxy-watch7-series-wireless-charging-and-wireless-power-sharing-features%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fwearables%2Fthe-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-and-watch-7-ultra-are-missing-a-killer-feature" target="_blank">support page</a> update, Samsung said that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Watch 7 Ultra</a> do not support wireless charging from a paired Galaxy phone. X user Jordy Verboven was the first to spot this change. </p><p>This handy feature basically lets the phone&apos;s battery wirelessly charge compatible smartwatches by placing them close together— a great way to get some charge into your watch when it&apos;s almost dying. While this feature won&apos;t be available on the new watches, it continues to be present in the older generation devices.</p><p>Samsung had to remove this feature due to a design change with the new sensor array, which required reshaping the rear glass on both Watch models, which increased the distance between the internal wireless charging coil and the external charging surface, making the previous wireless power-sharing capability impossible.</p>

Now, a decade later, the company is shutting down official updates.  </p><p>Google will discontinue the Google Play Services updates for Android Lollipop devices starting this month. A Google spokesperson said that the reason for putting a nail in the coffin is the percentage of active Android Lollipop devices, which is said to account for less than one percent at the moment.</p><p>While updates may no longer be available for this software version, Google Play Services support will continue to work. However, users won&apos;t receive "any new features, important security updates, and may not be compatible with some apps."</p><p>Android KitKat&apos;s updates also stalled in July last year. With Lollipop gone, Marshmallow handsets could be next in line.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-design-leaked-in-renders"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>A mid-week leak spilled some serious beans about the next OnePlus event launch; it gave us a full list of devices that could launch on July 16 in Milan. The lineup includes the OnePlus Nord 4, Pad 2,  Watch 2R, and Nord Buds 3 Pro. </p><p>The leak came from Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks). According to him, the OnePlus Nord 4 will have an all-metal body, a toned finish, and three colorways: black, mint, and silver. The Nord 4 is said to have a 6.74-inch 1.5K AMOLED display and a 120Hz refresh rate. The device will be powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3</a> and a 5500mAh battery capacity. The dual cameras at the back comprise a 50MP primary sensor, an 8MP secondary camera, and a 16MP selfie camera in the front.</p><p>Now, coming to the OnePlus Watch 2R— renders <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-leak-oneplus-watch-2r-pad-2-nord-buds-3-pro" target="_blank">shared by the publication</a> indicate that the smartwatch will come in green and a regular black colorway. This could be an affordable revamped version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-china-variant-launch">OnePlus Watch 2 variant</a> in the Chinese region with eSIM support.</p><p>Next up, the OnePlus Pad 2 may look a lot like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">predecessor</a>, featuring an aluminum unibody design with rounded corners. The tipster notes that it will include a 12.1-inch LCD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 900 nits. </p><p>Lastly, the company&apos;s next earbuds also seemed to leak. They look like they will feature a stem design similar to the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-nord-buds-2-review" target="_blank">Nord Buds 2</a> but with an oval aesthetic. The renders further indicate that the ear tip will have a glossy finish while the stem will have a matte finish.</p>

However, one key part of the Google One VPN is a feature called dark web report, which provides subscribers with insights on their data — specifically account login details and personal information — and whether it has been leaked on the dark web will be made free to all. </p><p>As spotted by 9to5Google, a banner in the Google One app explains that starting in late July, the dark web reports will work as a separate service and will no longer require a subscription. </p><p>" Dark web reports will become available to all users with a consumer Google Account," the company explains, as reported by 9to5Google. "Dark web report is integrated with results about you as a combined solution to help users protect their online presence."</p><p>Why could this be a good move, you ask? Our staff writer, Brady Snyder, feels that things like this shouldn&apos;t be a paid feature. "This functionality that helps people stay safe and protect their privacy should be free."</p><p>"Even if you stick to the basics, like name, address, and email, it&apos;ll be helpful to know what kind of data is on the web. For example, if you see that your email is appearing on the dark web, you might want to be more cautious when receiving unsolicited messages and enhance spam filters." </p>

<p>Samsung spent a few million dollars to show <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">some of its new products this week</a>. It was a typical tech event with executives telling us how great the new stuff is going to be, how much we&apos;re going to love it, and why the company is important enough for you to spend an hour listening. What it didn&apos;t tell you is that the company thinks you&apos;re a sucker.</p><p>That&apos;s the first thing I thought when the dust settled because Samsung thinks you&apos;ll spend nearly two thousand dollars on a phone, and it&apos;s right. At least <em>some</em> of us will. I won&apos;t, and neither should you.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not going to tell you that you shouldn&apos;t pay more money for a phone that folds in half or how you should spend your money in general. Everyone spends money on things they don&apos;t need, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.compcams.com/4-pattern-241-251-ib-243-253-ob-hydraulic-roller-cam-chevrolet-big-block-396-454.html">including me</a>. I am telling you that you <em>shouldn&apos;t</em> be buying your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">folding phone</a> from Samsung because if you do nothing is going to change. Especially the pricing.</p><p>I&apos;m not really faulting the company for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">adding $100 to the price</a>. Everything is more expensive, and the 5% bump should have been expected. It just happens to be 5% on a price that was too high to begin with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hKAcgLgLmQqbPiHaV9QiaU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-pink-side.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hKAcgLgLmQqbPiHaV9QiaU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Analysts and tech writers have been saying how foldables will become more accessible and less expensive for the past five years or so. I can&apos;t find anywhere that Samsung actually said it&apos;s definitely happening, but the company happily goes along with the idea and has never stepped up and said it&apos;s <em>not</em> going to happen. Samsung has gone so far as to say that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-26/samsung-aims-to-slash-cost-of-foldables-in-fight-with-iphone"><em>trying</em> to make it happen</a>, but it just hasn&apos;t done it.</p><p>I get that making a fancy hinge and a glass-plastic bonded screen that folds in half will add to the costs, but look at what other companies are doing. Do you really think that Samsung doesn&apos;t have a stronger supply chain or better access to materials than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus</a>? Or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google</a>? Or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor</a>? Of course it does, if for no other reason than many of the components come directly from Samsung itself. Why are Samsung&apos;s foldables as expensive — or more expensive — than what other companies offer?</p>
<p>Maybe every single piece inside of a Z Fold 6 is better than anything a competitor is offering. Or maybe Samsung knows it can charge whatever it likes because the people who were going to buy one will buy it regardless of the price. This, I think, is what Samsung is counting on.</p><p>Samsung knows almost nobody buys foldable phones and has even admitted that "most" of the people who do buy one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/12/samsung-foldables-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-growth/">are people who already have one</a>. The company also knows that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-foldable-smartphone-market-q1-2024/">no longer sells the lion&apos;s share</a> of folding phones. But does it care?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:795px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.62%;"><img id="5rpXAqnM8SX2jwopFc5wnC" name="counterpoint-foldable-market-share-q1-24.png" alt="Folding phone market share" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rpXAqnM8SX2jwopFc5wnC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="795" height="474" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Counterpoint Research)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One way to gain market share is to streamline manufacturing and sell cheaper phones. A 10% profit margin on millions more products is as lucrative as higher margins on things that aren&apos;t selling. This would fit right in with Samsung&apos;s message that everyone should want a foldable because they are cool, and it&apos;s exactly how Samsung beats out Apple to sell the most smartphones year after year. Offer more, sell it for less, and people will buy it.</p><p>An alternative plan is to not give a damn about market share, charge as much as you can, and depend on those repeat customers who you think are going to buy your overpriced products anyway. And yes, people who will buy a new Z Fold, no matter the price, do exist. Too many of them, in fact.</p>
<p>The only thing we can do as consumers is to not buy overpriced products; to stop being a sucker. If enough people vote with their wallets, we&apos;ll get more for our money.</p><p>I know I&apos;m not going to change anyone&apos;s mind by writing this. If you think Samsung is charging too much for a Fold 6, you don&apos;t need me to tell you. On the flip side, if you were going to buy one anyway, you&apos;ll think I&apos;m foolish and might even take the time to let me know. </p><p>I do know I&apos;m no sucker and won&apos;t let Samsung treat me like one.</p>

<hr>
<p>Hackers nabbed phone records of over 100 million AT&T customers from 2022, including data such as phone numbers, call/text counts, durations, and cell site identification numbers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/" target="_blank">TechCrunch reports</a>.</p><p>AT&T has already reported the data breach to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company is also working closely with law enforcement to sort this out, and it’s paying off—they&apos;ve already caught a suspect linked to the breach.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000073271724000046/t-20240506.htm" target="_blank">SEC filing</a>, AT&T disclosed that cybercriminals accessed and stole customer call and text data covering May 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022, plus another breach on January 2, 2023, affecting a few customers. The investigation shows the breach happened between April 14 and April 25, 2024.</p><p>Furthermore, AT&T told TechCrunch that the data breach affected customers of other networks using AT&T’s infrastructure. This includes call records for users of Cricket Wireless, Boost Mobile, and Consumer Cellular.</p><p>AT&T says it will reach out to all 110 million affected customers soon to keep everyone in the loop about the breach. Plus, it has set up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000102979" target="_blank">website</a> where you can find answers and info about what happened.</p><p>An AT&T spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the breach stemmed from a hacked account on Snowflake, a third-party cloud platform. Similar breaches at Ticketmaster and QuoteWizard were also linked to Snowflake. The cloud company blamed the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> on the AT&T account, underscoring the need for strong cybersecurity from both customers and vendors.</p><p>Snowflake allows companies to keep extensive customer data in the cloud for analysis. AT&T hasn&apos;t clarified why it wants to analyze such large amounts of data or why it&apos;s using Snowflake for storage, as per TechCrunch.</p><p>Cybersecurity experts at Mandiant have attributed the data breach to UNC5537, an unidentified cybercriminal group. Mandiant suggests the attack was likely financially motivated, meaning the stolen data could be used for fraud.</p><p>At the very least, hackers didn&apos;t access the content of calls and texts, or any personal information like names, Social Security numbers, or dates of birth. However, even though customer names weren&apos;t part of the breach, it&apos;s still possible to match a name with a phone number using online tools.</p><p>A big issue here is the delay in telling the public. AT&T knew about the breach in April but held off on announcing it twice. TechCrunch reports that the FBI, AT&T, and the Department of Justice agreed to keep it quiet due to national security and safety concerns. The specifics aren&apos;t clear, but this delay raises transparency questions and shows how tricky balancing cybersecurity and national security can be.</p><p>This recent breach is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/news-weekly-april-6-2024">another hit to AT&T&apos;s cybersecurity efforts</a>, coming soon after a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/73-million-atandt-accounts-leaked">separate leak earlier this year that affected over 70 million customers</a>. While AT&T claims the incidents are unrelated, the back-to-back breaches raise serious questions about the company&apos;s data security strategy and its ability to protect customer information.</p>

<p>Among the biggest device to launch during unpacked are the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6. The changes to these devices are fairly iterative, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 received a welcome change to the design that should help make it more palatable for consumers.</p><p>As pointed out in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6 hands-on</a>, the phone is now wider with a much squarer design. This should make the larger external display easier to use while bringing the internal folding display more in line with other foldable phones. The phone is also thinner thanks to some internal improvements, which should appease some fans.</p><p>The camera system is largely unchanged except for the ultrawide, which uses the same 12MP resolution but apparently uses a new sensor for better low-light performance.</p>

<p>The new Flip has fewer design changes, but there are a few notable upgrades. As noted in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6 hands-on</a>, the device has a flatter frame and a dash of color around the cameras. The phone also has a new 50MP primary camera, which should provide better image output, especially in low light, and the 4,000mAh battery should help it last longer before reaching for a charger.</p><p>The cover screen hasn&apos;t changed much, but some new software additions bring more widgets and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> to the external display.</p>
<p>Both phones are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and come with One UI 6.1.1 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, which brings more Galaxy AI features to the phones, like an improved Interpreter mode, Drawing Assist, new wallpaper features, and more.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-preorder-deals">available now</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-preorder-deals">for preorder</a> and start at $1899 and $1099, respectively.</p>

<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> may look familiar, but it&apos;s the inside that counts, and Samsung has upgraded the watch with its latest 3nm chip for improved performance, plus a revamped BioActive sensor that should make it more accurate. The watch runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, has double the storage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, comes with Galaxy AI features like suggested replies, and is capable of detecting sleep apnea, a disorder that disrupts breathing during sleep.</p>

<p>However, the real news is the Galaxy Watch Ultra, which takes things to another level. The watch has a large, rugged design and battery life that lasts up to 100 hours in power-saving mode or 48 hours in exercise power-saving mode. There&apos;s also a new Quick Button on the side that you can program to open and begin various functions like workouts or a stopwatch. This is in addition to the improved sensors, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature">sleep apnea detection</a>, new chipset, and more.</p><p>If it seems a little familiar, it&apos;s because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> also has an Action button that does more or less the same thing. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra hands-on</a>, we point out the similarities between this and Apple&apos;s offering, although Samsung manages to undercut Apple by a bit and still offers a circular display.</p><p>The Watch 7 and Watch Ultra are available for preorder and retail for $299 and $649, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Samsung Galaxy Ring</h2>

<p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> took off and started a trend of emerging smart rings from a bevy of smaller companies, Samsung decided to jump into the ring (pun very much intended) with its own. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> is capable of tracking one&apos;s sleep, vitals, and workouts while feeding all this information to the new Galaxy AI-powered Samsung Health, giving users insights into their wellness and offering ways to improve and reach their goals.</p><p>Beyond that, the ring also has some gesture controls for Galaxy smartphones. For example, users can take photos or silence alarms by pinching twice, something you won&apos;t find on other smart rings.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring hands-on</a>, we note that the ring feels quite thin and light compared to its competitors. It also has the backing of an entire ecosystem, which could give Oura a run for its money as the smart ring category heats up.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring comes in nine different sizes and three different finishes and lasts up to a week with a single charge. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-preorder-deals">available for preorder</a> and retails for $399 with no subscription.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy <del>AirPods</del> Buds 3 Pro are a complete redesign from previous iterations of Samsung earbuds. They offer a stem design similar to other wireless earbuds from Apple and others. Samsung differentiates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> by designing them with a light on the stem with a few functional indicators (or just to show off).</p><p>The earbuds have an in-ear design with improved audio, Adaptive EQ & Adaptive ANC, and higher voice bandwidth for calls. There are also some intelligent features like live translation with Interpreter mode and quick access to Bixby.</p><p>The regular Galaxy Buds have similar improvements but feature single drivers, no lights, no ambient sound, and fewer Galaxy AI features. They also have an open design for those of you who don&apos;t like in-ear buds, and they&apos;re cheaper at just $179. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro retail for $249.</p>

<p>Samsung's own Galaxy Watch 7 Sport Band is made of super comfy but resilient rubber. It's got whole throughout so you get an aerated, cooling effect. There are two main sizes to choose from and six shades. The price is a little high, but that's to be expected with first-party bands.</p></p>

<h2 id="it-apos-s-always-a-good-idea-to-have-some-spare-galaxy-watch-7-bands-2">It&apos;s always a good idea to have some spare Galaxy Watch 7 bands</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/what-color-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-should-you-buy">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 comes in some unusual colors</a>, so picking the right band for it requires some thinking and digging around. Luckily, the smartwatch is compatible with straps for older Galaxy Watch models too, so you have an ocean of choice. While Cream and Silver variants of the Galaxy Watch 7 go with most bands out there, the Green variant is a little harder to match.</p><p>Barton&apos;s Quick Release Top Grain Leather Watch Band comes in millions of band colors, clasp colors, sizes, and thread styles. You can peruse through the brand&apos;s offerings knowing full well that every single band has a quick-release connector that fits the Galaxy Watch 7 and that the top grain leather is indeed as good as expected. The leather strap ages over time, giving each one a unique look. Be sure to select the 20mm option when checking out, because that&apos;s the one that fits the Watch 7.</p><p>For metal link bands, there&apos;s none above the admirable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-modern-fit-band-samsung-galaxy-watch-review">Spigen Modern Fit Samsung Galaxy Watch band</a>. This high-grade stainless steel band fits a wide range of Galaxy Watch models, including the Galaxy Watch 7. You get a tool to open links yourself and adjust the band&apos;s size to fit your wrist perfectly. The Spigen Modern Fit Samsung Galaxy Watch band comes in silver, black, and rose gold. It&apos;s surprisingly affordable for such a high quality watchband.</p><p>If you want a solid, colorful band for everyday use, a silicone or rubber band is ideal for this. Both Samsung and Ritche sell compelling bands that are comfortable and easy to swap out. The difference is in the connectors they use and the material. Samsung favors the One Click connector with rubber for the band whereas Ritche favors the universal quick-release connector with silicone for the strap. If you&apos;re not looking to spend too much, Ritche&apos;s Classic Silicone Watch Band is more affordable.</p><p>Want to browse some more?

But now, it&apos;s already time to start looking at the Galaxy Z Flip 7, especially for those who may want to wait another year before upgrading their phones. So, what can we expect from the <em>next</em> Samsung flip phone?</p><p>Since we don&apos;t expect the Galaxy Z Flip 7 to launch until the summer of 2025, it&apos;s too early for rumors and leaks. However, we can still speculate and discuss what we&apos;d like to see based on current trends and what we think we know. So, while we continue testing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, here are the things we want to see on the Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-what-we-know-so-far-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: What we know so far</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rYJpJ9JRYBa7gPqFCFkvdH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-1.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Galaxy Z Flip 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYJpJ9JRYBa7gPqFCFkvdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While we may not know anything about the design of the Galaxy Z Flip 7, we may already know what chips will power it. Qualcomm is set to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">next-generation Snapdragon chip</a> later this year, which will be the first to feature the company&apos;s new Oryon cores. These are found in Qualcomm&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon Elite</a> chips, powering new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/-microsoft-copilot-plus-faq">Copilot Plus PCs</a> and promise to bring incredible power and efficiency.</p><p>We don&apos;t know any specifics about the chip aside from the fact that Oryon will be present. However, we can guess that it will be a major leap in performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kh8dGGQbfRbLbXSwXYZGJa" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Gen-4-Oryon-teaser.jpg" alt="Qualcomm teasing Oryon cores for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kh8dGGQbfRbLbXSwXYZGJa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Samsung is working on its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency">next-gen Exynos chip</a>, which will likely be built on an improved 3nm process that could bring enhanced efficiency gains that may even outpace the next Snapdragon flagship processor. Samsung is also likely to lean heavily into AI processing to match offerings from both Qualcomm and Google.</p><p>Elsewhere, we can guess that 12GB of RAM will be standard since it&apos;s what&apos;s available on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and the battery will likely be at least 4,000mAh or higher.</p><p>We can&apos;t say for sure if Samsung will change the design, but the company has stuck with the rather square and angular design for the last few generations.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-everything-we-want-to-see-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Everything we want to see</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="urT3exABritgaDpdMQjE4e" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-yellow-cover-flex.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover panel and cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/urT3exABritgaDpdMQjE4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s Android Central&apos;s wishlist for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 based on the specs and our limited hands-on time with the Z Flip 6:</p>
<p><strong>A larger, more functional cover screen</strong></p><p>Samsung made waves when it introduced the much larger cover screen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. This was the current trend, after all, with companies like Motorola and OPPO opting for larger external displays. However, compared to its closest competitors, like the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and even last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a>, the Z Flip 6 is still on the smaller side of flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Flip 7, I would love to see Samsung increase the size of the cover screen while also getting rid of the weird notch at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7imWmpTkmd8sCxGcyPyCB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-2024.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Motorola Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7imWmpTkmd8sCxGcyPyCB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4073" height="2291" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But even beyond that, I would like to see Samsung provide a better cover screen experience out of the box. Unlike the Razr series, Samsung still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">makes users go through hoops</a> to enable app use on the external display, with a limited number available via the Labs feature and more through accessible with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> module.</p><p>Samsung says it wants to focus on the widget experience by providing better functionality for quickly accessing certain apps without needing to dive into them, and that&apos;s fine, but we should be able to have it both ways.</p>
<p><strong>Less edge, more curves</strong></p><p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip 6 design. Its flat frame and back panels give the phone a very clean look, and the addition of the color-matching camera sensors is a nice touch. However, holding phones like this can actually hurt.</p><p>I realized this while reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>; the edge of the frame would dig into my fingers, making it very uncomfortable to hold the phone after some time. After my brief hands-on with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, I can tell this will likely be a problem here, too.</p><p>Motorola has taken a different approach with a curved frame, with back and cover panels that seamlessly curve into it. The result is a phone that&apos;s fairly comfortable to hold despite it being larger than the Z Flip 6. I&apos;m not saying Samsung should go completely curvy, but maybe a major design re-do is in order after we have largely gotten the same thing for the past few generations.</p>
<p><strong>Faster charging</strong></p><p>I&apos;m happy to see Samsung is finally giving the Galaxy Z Flip 6 a battery life boost with the new 4,000mAh battery. With the more efficient <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chip, this should help users achieve all-day battery life. However, as the battery becomes larger, the charging time will become slower since Samsung has kept the same 25W speed.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5 can take as much as an hour and a half to charge fully, and ain&apos;t nobody got time for that! Meanwhile, OPPO and Motorola&apos;s latest flip phones provide speeds of 44W and 45W, respectively, making it much less of a hassle to get a good amount of juice before heading out.</p><p>You&apos;ve already got one-half of the equation, Samsung, but the others are showing you up in a category you popularized!</p>
<p><strong>Bring back Bespoke</strong></p><p>One of the best things about flip phones is that they just look so nice. Even with cheaper models, flip phones are just surprisingly stylish phones, so it&apos;s no wonder why they capture a certain audience. I feel like Samsung really had something going when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-bespoke-edition">Bespoke Edition Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, allowing users to mix and match different color options beyond the standard offering.</p><p>Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which comes in some nice colors, hasn&apos;t been able to match this level of customizability.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors aren&apos;t exactly my favorite, as I&apos;m not a fan of pastels, but being able to mix it up with different options for the bottom panel, the frame/hinge, and the camera sensors would make the buying process so much more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Z Flip FE</strong></p><p>Now that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 costs $100 more than its predecessors, Samsung needs to consider giving us a cheaper model to launch alongside the "flagship." Similar to other Fan Edition models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-make-galaxy-z-flip-fe">Samsung should offer a Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> to appeal to consumers not willing to spend more and more on a new phone.</p><p>Motorola already does this by offering the Razr in Plus and non-Plus (lovingly called the Minus) models. In fact, the company upped its game by giving the cheaper model the same design as last year&apos;s flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>, which is quite a feat.</p>
<p>Samsung could do something similar, by giving the Galaxy Z Flip 7 a larger cover screen and "borrowing" the cover screen design from the Flip 5 or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review">Flip 4</a> for a cheaper foldable. And for good measure, Samsung should charge $799 for this phone, which is cheaper than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but still more than a the non-Plus Razr. </p>

<p>There's one big difference between the ASUS CX34 Flip and CM34 Flip. The former is powered by an Intel Core i3 chip, while the latter makes use of AMD's Ryzen 3 7320C.

<h2 id="more-chromebook-brands-2">More Chromebook brands</h2>
<p>Of course, this list only features a few of the many excellent brands that sell Chromebooks. In addition to smartphones and wearables, Samsung makes quite a few impressive Chromebooks, while HP and Dell are known for selling their own powerful devices. Although it&apos;s a little hard to find on sale, HP also sells the HP Dragonfly Pro, a laptop that we selected as the "best premium pick" in our guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>. If that device happens to go on sale this Prime Day, we&apos;ll update this guide as quickly as possible. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon has confirmed that the 10th annual Prime Day sale event will run from July 16th through July 17th. </p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-find-the-best-deals-during-prime-day-2">How can I find the best deals during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>We&apos;ll be reporting all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">best Prime Day deals</a> for Android fans here on our site, but you can also find all sorts of deals by signing up for one of Amazon&apos;s newsletters. If you&apos;re unsure about the quality of an offer, we also suggest using a price history tracking tool like <strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong> to get some context before hitting that Add to Cart button. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-on-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop on Prime Day?</h2>
<p>For the most part, Prime Day is exclusive to subscribers. If you haven&apos;t become a member yet, we suggest signing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can enjoy all of the benefits of the sale for free. Alternatively, you can keep an eye on competitors&apos; sites — such as Best Buy or Walmart — to see if they&apos;re matching Amazon&apos;s prices.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-chromebook-2">How do I choose a Chromebook?</h2>
<p>There's always a ton of specs and features you typically need to juggle when shopping for a laptop, but for Chromebooks, the buyer's guide can be summed up pretty well into four points:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Get a touchscreen.</strong> — Unless you're anti-fun, there's no reason not to get a touchscreen model; they do not cost that much more and it's always worth it. Touchscreens make it easier to interact with Android apps as well as making it easier to do things like sign documents or zoom in precisely.<br></li><li><strong>4GB of RAM is good, 8GB is better.</strong> — Most Chromebooks sold today come with 4GB of RAM, and 4GB is perfectly fine for running a video call plus a dozen or so tabs in Chrome. More RAM is always better, but 4GB is fine. If it says it has 2GB of RAM — or 16GB of internal storage — close the tab and walk away.<br></li><li><em><strong>Check the expiration date!!!</strong></em> — Yes, Chromebooks come with expiration dates, after which they are no longer guaranteed to receive Chrome OS updates. It's called the AUE date, and they're listed for every single Chromebook model on the relevant <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366">Google support page</a>, so before you move that Lightning Deal Chromebook from your cart to the checkout, take ten seconds and look it up on this page. Most Chromebooks launched in 2021-2023 have 10 years of support ahead of them.</li></ol>

<ul><li>After Unpacked, Samsung detailed how it plans to improve its customer Care service by partnering with AT&T's Call Center agents.</li><li>AT&T customers can rely on its Call Center to find information and schedule (in-warranty) walk-in repair services for a Galaxy phone.</li><li>Additionally, Samsung's experts can benefit from a new AI feature, which will deliver all the information about a user's call and provide accurate help.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A few upgrades to Samsung&apos;s Customer Care network for Galaxy owners follow quickly behind its latest wave of foldable devices.</p><p>In a press release, the company states Galaxy users can now call upon AT&T&apos;s Call Center agents for help regarding (in-warranty) walk-in phone repair services. The post adds that these services can be done at any one of its 700 Samsung retail or uBreakiFix by Asurion locations across the United States.</p><p>While this newfound phone repair service applies to AT&T customers, Samsung says the quickness of this method often leads to same-day opportunities. Moreover, the Korean OEM&apos;s work with AT&T adds Same Unit Repair (SUR) options to the network&apos;s customers.</p><p>In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-expands-next-generation-care-att-introduces-new-ai-powered-tools/">blog post</a>, Samsung stated it&apos;s committed to getting a person&apos;s sensitive device back into their hands quickly. Through SUR, repair services will work to get a user&apos;s device fixed to "factory quality condition" and return it without needing a "comparable new or refurbished unit."</p><p>Not only does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.att.com/story/2024/samsung-unpacked.html">SUR&apos;s availability</a> help cut back on e-waste, but Samsung states users won&apos;t have to worry about backing up data or transfers.</p><p>The other side of this update is Samsung&apos;s AI tools to help its experts handle and resolve your problem. This "next-gen Care" is strengthened by the new Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to help agents understand a user&apos;s reason for calling (intent). The software helps agents identify a customer&apos;s device and the problem to then direct them to the appropriate areas for help.</p><p>The AI can text a user located near them for walk-in service or an authorized repair center using their zip code. IVR also serves as a text-based alternative for customers interested in receiving status updates about a repair ticket&apos;s status.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="3SV5r9aZAmw7eKHxaaesGK" name="samsung-care-ubreakifix-asurion-flagship-stores-featured.png" alt="Samsung and uBreakiFix partnership for device repair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3SV5r9aZAmw7eKHxaaesGK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="533" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung reiterates the benefits of walk-in repair, such as the ability for customers to seek help if they have a Galaxy S21 device or newer. More importantly, your device can be fixed and returned to you if you&apos;ve scheduled an appointment at 3 PM or sooner.</p><p>Additionally, users can experience "personalized" consultation regarding the repair of their phone.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ubreakifix-expand-repair-options">Following its expansion</a>, Samsung has continued to push its efforts to bring convenient and easy device repair through uBreakiFix. Last August, both companies upgraded their partnership by adding more repair options to customers. At the same time, the companies started working on opening 50 new repair shops across the U.S. by the end of 2023. That was the start of quicker repairs and same-day service, as Samsung noted at the time.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following Samsung&apos;s Unpacked, the company started discussing its hopes for its latest foldables, which involves increasing its sales.</p><p>The company&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM (Tae-moon) Roh, spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240711002000320?">Yonhap News</a> and reporters following the event to discuss sales figures (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_wants_galaxy_z_fold6_and_flip6_to_deliver_10_better_sales_than_their_predecessors-news-63685.php">GSMArena</a>). Roh informed the press that the company aims "to sell 10 percent more of new products compared with the previous model released last year."</p><p>He added, "This time, we&apos;ve introduced products that are more complete and immaculate in every aspect, such as the camera and battery." These aspects may facilitate the "better results" Samsung expects from its 2024 foldable devices.</p><p>Roh then discussed the "user-friendly" features provided through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-boast-ai-upgrades-and-thinner-bodies">Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6</a> thanks to Qualcomm. Both devices feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy SoC in all regions. When the SD 8 Gen 3 debuted, the headliner was its strong focus on boosting the on-device AI capabilities of future flagship devices. The chip then provided boosts to a phone&apos;s CPU and GPU processes.</p><p>Samsung states the chip helps its foldable phones by "optimizing" its AI features and "enhancing" other basic functions.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how well Samsung&apos;s 2024 foldables perform, however, the Flip 5 and Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">shattered pre-order records</a> last year. The numbers stemmed from South Korea, where the company amassed a whopping 1.02 million foldable preorders. Among them, the Flip 5 took the crown with 70% of the cut.</p><p>Those sales broke Samsung&apos;s previous highest tallied count of 970,000 pre-order sales for its Galaxy foldable phones on home soil. With Roh estimating (and hoping) for a 10% growth in sales back by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, it&apos;s going to be interesting to see where consumer interest falls.</p><p>However, it&apos;s worth noting that Samsung&apos;s showing of the Fold 6 wasn&apos;t that impressive, leaving some to ponder <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-new-galaxy-z-fold-6">if the upgrade is worth it</a>. Aside from its AI focus, there was little by way of innovation from the Korean OEM&apos;s folding devices. Let&apos;s also not forget that the devices came at an extra cost — roughly $100.</p>
