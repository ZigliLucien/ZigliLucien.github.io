<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rumors indicate that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could be the world's first foldable phone with a titanium frame, potentially differentiating it significantly from its predecessors.</li><li>While the switch to titanium might enhance durability, it could also result in a higher price point, though nothing is confirmed yet.</li><li>Speculation suggests that both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 could launch in July.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung decided to go with a titanium frame for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and now it looks like the company is thinking of using the same material for its next folding phone.</p><p>As per leaker @Tech_Reve on X (formerly Twitter), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is rumored to ditch the aluminum frame of the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> and opt for a titanium one instead (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-titanium-frame-rumor/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). If this turns out to be true, Samsung&apos;s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> would be the first in the world to boast a titanium frame.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Z Fold 6 equipped with titanium.<a href="https://twitter.com/Tech_Reve/status/1771412393761141025">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>This backs up an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1760285931813404845" target="_blank">earlier rumor</a> hinting at Samsung&apos;s move to embrace a titanium frame for its upcoming book-style foldable. It&apos;s a shift we&apos;ve already witnessed with Apple&apos;s iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, using titanium in a phone does usually bump up the cost.</p><p>Since Samsung has already made the switch with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, it seems likely the company will do the same with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, we&apos;re crossing our fingers that this change won&apos;t come with a price increase.</p><p>Right now, it&apos;s unclear whether Samsung will stick with the same Grade 2 titanium frame seen on the Galaxy S24 Ultra or opt for a higher-grade version.</p><p>We&apos;ve already caught a glimpse of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">leaked renders showing what the Galaxy Z Fold 6 might look like</a>, but they didn&apos;t exactly get us excited. There&apos;s also talk that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-improved-ultra-thin-glass-and-thinner-design">might come with a better UTG (Ultra Thin Glass) screen</a> for a smoother touch experience and stronger durability.</p><p>Recent rumors suggest that both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> are set to make their debut in July, arriving a year after their predecessors. There&apos;s also a rumor floating around about the possibility of a more affordable version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-fe-may-drop-this-key-feature-to-bring-the-price-down">potentially dubbed the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE</a>.</p><p>It totally makes sense for Samsung to go all out in distinguishing the cheaper alternative from the premium Galaxy Z Fold 6. Similar to its predecessor, the latter will come with S-Pen support, a feature that might be absent in the FE variant. The potential addition of a titanium frame will further set it apart from the cheaper model.</p>

<p>The creation of the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) opened the door to better compatibility when it comes to using a stylus on a Chromebook. Now that USI has been around for a while, there are plenty of great Chromebooks available that support the standard. Some even come with a stylus in tow.</p><p>Getting the best Chromebook with a stylus included makes it so you don&apos;t have to search for one after the fact, and you have everything you need out of the box. If you&apos;re confused about choosing one, here are all the best ones based on factors like your budget, battery life, or simply the best one all around!</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714</a> is the answer, which was revamped in 2022, complete with Intel&apos;s 12th Gen chipsets and Iris Xe graphics. With the Spin 714, Acer actually remedied a few of the complaints we&apos;ve had with some of the best Chromebooks. Although the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023)</a> is now out, the newer iteration does not come with a stylus anymore. Therefore, the 2022 variant continues to be the best Chromebook that comes with a stylus.</p><p>Not only is Intel&apos;s Core i5 chipset paired with 8GB of RAM more than enough power to handle practically everything. But it also sports a wonderful display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, along with plenty of ports, including multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/intel-thunderbolt-4-official-8k-display">Thunderbolt 4</a> ports. The star of the show with the Spin 714 is the garaged USI stylus that is found at the edge of the bottom casing. This makes it easy to grab the stylus when you want to flip over into tablet mode or if you need to sign a document quickly.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, having a garaged stylus removes the need to worry about losing your Chromebook stylus. While it&apos;s not exactly the most comfortable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI stylus</a> we&apos;ve used, we&apos;re big fans of the convenience provided by being housed right in the chassis. Now, you can just download your favorite note-taking apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chrome-os-102-release">Google Cursive</a> or Nebo, take the stylus out of the slot, and start hand-writing your notes from anywhere without trying to find exactly where you put your stylus.</p>

<p>While a few companies have tried to release ChromeOS tablets, none really caught on in the same way that the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet</a> did. This was really the ultimate tablet for media consumption, especially if you just wanted to unwind for the day on the couch. Considering its popularity, we assumed it was only a matter of time before Lenovo released a successor.</p><p>That&apos;s exactly what Lenovo did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">IdeaPad Chromebook Duet 3</a>. Despite changing the naming scheme to fall in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Chromebook Duet 5</a>, the Duet 3 solved quite some of the issues we had with the original Duet, with a few caveats. Not only is this one of the first Chromebooks to be released with USI 2.0 compatibility, but it&apos;s also the only current Chromebook to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-usi-2-stylus">limited to USI 2.0 stylus pens</a>. This means that if owned one of the best stylus for Chromebooks, then you&apos;ll need to adjust accordingly.</p><p>While Lenovo includes the detachable keyboard and kickstand case in the box, you might be disappointed if you grab the model with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. That&apos;s because Lenovo is <em>only</em> including its new USI 2.0 Stylus Pen with the model using 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><p>It&apos;s definitely a bit frustrating, but you can also grab Lenovo&apos;s USI 2.0 Stylus Pen separately if you just want to go with the base model. At the end of the day, the Chromebook Duet 3 remains one of our favorite Chromebooks, and its smaller form factor is a delight to carry around.</p>

<p>It&apos;s getting a little old now, but the ASUS Chromebook Detachable CM3 is still one of the best detachable Chromebooks that comes with a stylus in tow. Powered by the <br>
MediaTek Kompanio 500 processor, the Detachable CM3 comes with a garaged USI stylus and detachable keyboard.</p><p>The Chromebook Detachable CM3 features a 10.5-inch LCD with a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio and is capable of reaching up to 320 nits of brightness. The base configuration comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, paired with Arm Mali-G72 MP3 graphics.</p><p>As the name suggests, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 is a 2-in-1 convertible, allowing you to flip back the screen to either take notes or just prop it up to watch a movie or just pop the keyboard off to use it as a tablet. The case itself has a stand built into the back, so you can prop up the Chromebook in laptop mode as well as tablet mode.</p><p>Sadly, there&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sd-cards-your-chromebook">microSD card</a> slot, so you can&apos;t add more storage if you need to. While we wish ASUS used a 16:10 QHD screen, the Chromebook Detachable CM3&apos;s display still looks pretty darn great.</p>

<p>ChromeOS has finally matured to the point where we can start enjoying truly high-end hardware that rivals some of the best Windows laptops. If you don&apos;t believe me, all you need to do is take one look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-elite-dragonfly-chromebook-review">HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook</a>. You would be hard-pressed to find a Chromebook that can rival what the Dragonfly has to offer.</p><p>In addition to the 13.5-inch display with its 3:2 aspect ratio, you&apos;ll enjoy 12th Gen Intel chips, configurable with up to 32GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are dual Thunderbolt 4 ports onboard, along with a full-size HDMI and even a microSD card slot. However, the real star of the show is the haptic trackpad, giving Chromebooks a taste of why there are so many fans of the trackpad found on the best MacBooks. </p><p>As for stylus support, you don&apos;t have to worry about compatibility, as HP includes its USI Digital Pen in the box with the Dragonfly. This attaches magnetically to the side of the bottom frame, which helps you keep track of it, but it also recharges the stylus whenever it&apos;s attached. </p><p>While this is arguably one of the best Chromebooks ever made, its excellence is only superseded by its exorbitant price tag. This is definitely not the cheapest Chromebook on the market, but in our opinion, it&apos;s worth every penny as long as you have the money to spend.</p>

<p>To be quite honest, whenever a new Chromebook comes across our desk, it&apos;s definitely a bit odd to find the ones that don&apos;t include stylus support. However, not every Chromebook includes a stylus in the box.</p><p>Because there aren&apos;t very many options if you want a Chromebook that includes a stylus, it makes the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2022) even more appealing. Not only does it offer incredible performance, but the stylus is also always with you, removing the need to empty your bag just to find it. Plus, you&apos;re getting one of the best processors that Intel has to offer at a fraction of the price compared to premium options.</p><p>If you want a true ChromeOS tablet that includes a stylus, just make sure you grab the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Lenovo includes its USI 2.0 stylus pen in the box, along with the detachable keyboard and magnetic kickstand. The Duet 3 is lightweight, portable, and a fantastic choice for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">taking notes in class</a> or just playing some solitaire.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Nord CE4 is expected to debut on April 1, potentially as a rebranded version of the Ace 3V from China.</li><li>Notable differences between the Nord CE4 and Ace 3V include the Nord CE4's 100W charging capability, making it the fastest-charging Nord phone yet.</li><li>The display of the Nord CE4 will feature an AMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus continues to drip-feed bits of information about the upcoming Nord CE4, and the latest word from the company sheds light on how fast it charges and its display refresh rate.</p><p>We&apos;ve already known that the OnePlus Nord CE4 is slated for an April 1 debut. Rumor has it that it&apos;s likely going to be a revamped version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3v-goes-official-in-china">Ace 3V that recently launched in China</a>.</p><p>However, there might be a couple of tweaks that set them apart. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/nord-ce4-5g" target="_blank">OnePlus India</a>, the Nord CE 4 will rock 100W charging, claiming the title of the speediest-charging model yet among our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">favorite OnePlus phones</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_ce4_display_specs-news-62116.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>When it comes to the display, OnePlus has also revealed additional details. The upcoming smartphone is locked in to sport an AMOLED screen with an FHD+ resolution and a buttery smooth 120Hz screen refresh rate.</p><p>If this pans out, the Nord CE4 looks like it&apos;s going to hit that sweet spot in the midrange game. We&apos;re still in the dark about the exact screen size, but it&apos;ll probably hover around the 6.7-inch ballpark, considering the previous model.</p><p>On paper, it&apos;s looking pretty solid. However, it&apos;s a step down from the 1.5K resolution we saw on the Ace 3V.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord series aims to offer bang for your buck, especially the Nord CE devices, which take affordability even further compared to the mainline Nord phones. While the price of the Nord CE4 remains a mystery, it&apos;s definitely showing off some impressive specs on paper.</p><p>The company has been having a blast building up the hype for the big reveal, dropping hints here and there about what to expect from the device. At this stage, we&apos;re pretty clued in about what this midranger is packing. OnePlus has already confirmed that the next Nord CE installment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-to-launch-on-april-1-2024">will rock the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC under the hood</a>.</p><p>The upcoming phone might hit the shelves with an 8GB LPDDR4x RAM and 256GB storage option, but there&apos;s a chance we&apos;ll see more choices when it officially drops.</p><p>However, it&apos;s worth noting that the internal specs take a slight dip compared to the Ace 3V in China, which boasts the newer Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chip, starting with a base configuration of 12GB LPDDR5x RAM.</p>

<ul><li>Google Wallet previously allowed users to make contactless payments in small amounts without unlocking their device, though the exact terms varied by region.</li><li>Last month, Google added a disclaimer to a related support article that warned users that their payment wouldn't go through unless they had recently unlocked their device.</li><li>Now, this change is rolling out in Europe, and users took to social media to share their frustration with this change. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a change to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> that will make using contactless payments for small transactions more secure but also more frustrating. Google Wallet works in different ways based on a user&apos;s region, and in Europe, it previously allowed users to pay in small amounts without unlocking their devices. The threshold varied by country, and in some places like the U.S., all transactions required a device unlock. Now, Google is making device unlocks a requirement for all users in all reasons, and not everyone is happy about the change. </p><p>The company updated a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519#zippy=%2Cpayment-limits-on-a-locked-device" target="_blank">support document</a> last month related to tap-to-pay transactions, previewing the shift in Google Wallet behavior (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/google-wallet-unlock/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). </p><p>"Coming soon, your credit and debit card won&apos;t be charged for retail payments unless you&apos;ve recently used a verification method, like your fingerprint or PIN," the notice reads. "Some users may already need to verify to make a payment. If you’re asked to verify it’s you, complete verification steps on your device to make a payment."</p><p>U.S. users won&apos;t notice a change because device unlocks were already necessary for all transactions other than those using express transit. However, users in other countries could make transactions under a given threshold without unlocking in Google Wallet. For example, people in Canada could make payments under $100 CAD without unlocking their devices. In the U.K., that limit is around £45 GBP.</p><p>However, people in regions where device unlocks were not always required are finding they now need to authenticate each contactless payment in Google Wallet, no matter the transaction size. The only exception is if a user has recently used a verification method. So, if you authenticated Google Wallet a minute ago and haven&apos;t locked your device, you won&apos;t need to unlock it again. </p><p>Though this change makes Google Wallet objectively more secure, not everyone is happy about it. A few users on Reddit criticized the shift, and others called it a non-issue. One thing many seem to agree on is that Google should have left the choice up to the end user whether to require device unlocks for every transaction. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s choice to require verification for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">Google Wallet payments</a> of all denominations has brought up an age-old debate in cybersecurity: do you want convenience or security? Users on social media disagree, but in this case, Google has made the decision for them. </p>

<ul><li>With the second Android 15 Developer Preview, users can choose between a pinned or hidden taskbar on large-screened Pixel devices. </li><li>The option marks the return of the Android 12L-style taskbar, which was present at the bottom of the screen all the time. </li><li>Now, Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet users can employ a persistent taskbar for multitasking or a hidden taskbar for extra screen real estate. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google sent out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second Android 15 Developer Preview</a> this past week, and it includes a change that&apos;ll benefit owners of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a> or Pixel Tablet.</p><p>Now that the company makes a few big-screened devices, Google has been swiftly optimizing Android for larger displays. Part of that effort included adding the taskbar as a way to quickly launch apps and multitask from anywhere in Android, and starting with Android 15 DP2, users have the choice of having a pinned or floating taskbar. </p><p>Since it was introduced a few years ago, the taskbar has evolved quite a bit. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12l-how-google-fixes-android-foldables-and-large-screens">Android 12L</a>, it was a permanent fixture at the bottom of large Android devices. It remained on the screen while users opened up other apps, thus cutting into the total screen space available. That&apos;s why Google reversed course in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, transitioning the taskbar into a floating oval that could be shown or hidden as needed. However, there was never a way to choose between these taskbar variants. </p><p>That is, until now. Android expert Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-taskbar-pinning-3427938/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> first noticed the option to choose between taskbar styles in Android 15 DP2. After tapping and holding on an open space in the taskbar, a new <strong>Always show taskbar </strong>toggle will appear. There&apos;s a toggle beside it, and tapping the toggle will transition the windowed taskbar into the pinned taskbar.</p><p>While the Android 15 DP2 version of the floating taskbar is visually updated with the new Android design language, it&apos;s more or less functionally identical to the old version. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 15 DP2 finally adds the "taskbar pinning" feature I first spotted backed in Android 14 Beta 3!This feature lets Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet users revert back to the old, persistent taskbar style introduced in Android 12L.More details 👇https://t.co/Upo1d7tQ5z<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1771225394185699757">March 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>There are clear benefits to going with each taskbar version. The pinned taskbar option makes it easier to call up new apps, create multitasking views, and switch between active apps. On the other hand, the floating taskbar gives you more screen space to fill up with Android apps. The good thing about the Android 15 DP2 change is that Pixel Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> users now have the option of choosing the taskbar version they prefer best.</p>

The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) was seen in Pink in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-leak">leaked renders</a> early this month.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.36%;"><img id="Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-render-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1146" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside the design, the rest of the specs are likely pretty similar to those of its predecessor. It includes a 10.4-inch screen with 2000 x 1200 resolution accompanied by sizable bezels. The optics setup will again likely comprise a single 8MP sensor on the rear and a 5MP selfie shooter on the front. The rear camera would presumably support 1080p video recording.</p><p>The prominent aspect of the predecessor is its battery capacity, and the Tab S6 Lite (2024) is also expected to sport a massive 7,040mAh battery with 14-hour video playback. The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">mid-range tablet</a> also supports the S-Pen, which attaches to the right pane of the device and matches the corresponding color of the tablet.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting change from the previous iteration is the chipset powering the tablet. It is expected to ship with an Exynos 1280 SoC, which powers some Galaxy phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review">Galaxy A53 5G</a>. The same chipset was mentioned in the previous leak, which showcased the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) renders. </p>

<p>For storage, the upcoming Galaxy Tab S6 would feature at least 4GB of RAM aided by either 64GB or 128GB of onboard storage, and microSD support is expected for additional storage. 91mobiles further notes that the device will ship One UI 6.1 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>) out of the box. Additional highlights of the device include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.3, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and AKG-powered speakers.</p><p>The device recently went through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-bis-india-launch/">BIS certification</a> bearing <strong>SM-P620</strong> and <strong>SM-P625</strong> model numbers, which indicate that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) would be available in Wi-Fi and LTE variants. It also seems to have appeared in the U.S. FCC and Denmark&apos;s UL database — all pointing out to an imminent launch starting with India.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> is $200 off for the Amazon Big Spring Sale, cutting nearly a third off the cost to bring it to its lowest price ever. With its vibrant 6.2-inch AMOLED display, 128GB of storage, and the powerful Google Tensor G3 chipset, this <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is a great pick—especially at this price point.</p>
<p>While this phone's upgrade configuration, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, offers some of the best cameras on the market, the more affordable Pixel 8 also takes great pictures and videos and offers both rear and front wide-angle lenses.</p>

Its 6.2-inch AMOLED display doesn&apos;t hinder it from being a great phone for one-hand users, as Google designed it to be about 5.1mm shorter and 2.4mm narrower than the last-generation Pixel 7. The screen offers a refresh rate of 120Hz, and while the Google Tensor G3 chipset isn&apos;t the fastest processor out there, it still features smooth performance with a beautiful, user-friendly UI design.</p><p>This configuration comes with 128GB of storage, though you can also upgrade to 256GB. It also offers three powerful cameras, including both rear- and front-facing  wide-angle lenses, and seven years of Android OS updates—the most you can get with an Android phone.</p>

Some sources say that Gemini&apos;s array would be integrated into Apple&apos;s generative AI features that are being developed for the iPhone. These new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Gemini-backed</a> capabilities will reportedly be available on Apple&apos;s iOS 18, which will be released later this year. </p><p>iPhones could get AI-based image creation, and the update could enable features like "writing essays based on simple prompts." Apple has reportedly been testing its own Learning Language Model in the past year, such as its own AI chatbot called "Apple GPT." However, it looks like the company is leaning towards Google&apos;s &apos;more superior&apos; AI model.</p><p>Apple&apos;s CEO Tim Cook said he is looking at implementing Apple&apos;s version of AI features onto the iPhone on a "very thoughtful basis."</p>

This means that Google now has the fourth-largest market share in the country. </p><p>Google unlocked handset sales are on the rise and account for 9% of total sales. However, to keep up with Samsung (20%) and Apple (19%), Google has a long way to go. According to Anthony Scarsella, Research Director at IDC, "Apple and Samsung continue strengthening their hold on the US smartphone market, with the two vendors combining for 74.2 percent of the market. This represents an all-time high market share for the two vendors."</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Google has released another sneak peek of Android 15 for developers before the big open beta premiers in April. The latest release shows better ways to chat even when the device&apos;s signals are weak, support for apps on the tiny screens of flippable phones, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:507px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.79%;"><img id="Vwqo9KHG5Dv3BWpbFRPm68" name="android-15-DP2.png" alt="notification when device connects to satellite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vwqo9KHG5Dv3BWpbFRPm68.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="507" height="511" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most prominent feature that Google gave a peek into is its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-pixel-feature-spotted">satellite connectivity</a>, which allows users to stay connected no matter where they are. On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, Google introduced a feature that allowed your phone to recognize multiple languages for audio and switch between them automatically; with Android 15, it wants to improvise on this feature and give apps the opportunity to run this seamlessly.</p><p>This update focuses on ensuring apps run smoothly rather than adding new features. Google has also been working on tightening up privacy, security, and the overall user experience. This developer preview of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is mainly for app makers preparing for the next big Android release, which will probably drop in the fall. </p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/us-doj-sues-apple-iphone-monopoly"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Apple on Thursday (Mar 21) for monopolizing the smartphone market. Along with 16 other district attorneys, the DOJ is targeting the tech giant for its "anti-competitive practices." </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/9765671b79f64ad9/6cfe3c6c-full.pdf">antitrust lawsuit</a> claims that Apple takes advantage of its dominant ecosystem and monopoly power to extract more money from consumers, developers, and others. The lawsuit targets Apple&apos;s most-priced possessions, the iPhone and the Apple Watch, as well as messaging, how the company handles cloud streaming games, and more.</p><p>The DOJ says that the company has always known that this kind of dominance has been threatened by other factors, such as innovative products and apps. And instead of responding to these competitive threats by lowering the prices of its products for consumers, Apple has always wriggled its way out by imposing a series of "shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines."</p><p>The complaint talks about how Apple has blocked cross-platform messaging, the compatibility of its devices with Android phones, and the restriction of developers from creating apps that would bring about advancements in technology, among others. They accuse Apple of knowingly bringing about strategies to make customers reliant on their products. </p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107784/apples-response-to-the-dojs-iphone-antitrust-lawsuit">The Verge</a>, Apple responded to the lawsuit, stating that it threatened its identity and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hXkujXP5jVbocrAHnzM9NU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-bottom-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXkujXP5jVbocrAHnzM9NU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-user-discovers-debris-inside-hinge"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Some Galaxy Z Fold users have been reporting a peculiar issue—their phones aren&apos;t unfolding all the way. However, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1bfrnpi/managed_to_open_fold_4_flat_evidence_against/">Reddit user</a> has managed to uncover the reason behind this. He believes that debris finds its way into the moving part of the hinge. To solve the problem, all he had to do was dismantle the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and remove debris from the hinge by hand.</p><p>In the post, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 user described having an increasingly difficult time opening their smartphone completely flat. After failed attempts to get Samsung to repair or replace the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, he decided to take apart the device, revealing a collection of lint, thread, and other debris trapped inside the hinge that prevented it from opening. After putting the device back together, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 was able to open completely flat again. </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1bfrnpi/managed_to_open_fold_4_flat_evidence_against">Managed to Open Fold 4 Flat - Evidence Against Samsung's Warranty Denial</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold">r/GalaxyFold</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This could hint at a bigger problem that tech companies should address while making foldables. Dust, debris, and other small particles could impact the overall performance of the device. The issue of folding phones not opening flat became an important topic around the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a>, which some claim is not able to unfold flat. One of our units at Android Central seems to be limited to 178-179 degrees rather than the full 180 degrees.</p>

Everyone has a favorite tech brand it seems.</p>

<p>It&apos;s important to note that this is only a U.S. thing and has nothing to do with Apple&apos;s business elsewhere. Just as we saw when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eu-finds-apple-guilty-abusing-its-dominant-market-position-spotify-antitrust-case">EU went after Apple</a> and changes were made that only affected products sold in the EU, any results in this trial only affect business done in the U.S.</p>
<p>Having said that, the complaint against Apple claims that the company:</p>
<ul><li>Degrades and undermines cross-platform messaging apps and rival smartphones, including introducing deliberate incompatibilities to prevent Android users from seamlessly sending messages to iPhone users.</li><li>Makes it difficult for U.S. app developers to list "Super Apps," which have a broad array of functions and make it easier for consumers to switch from one phone manufacturer to another </li><li>Blocks cloud gaming services on iPhones by historically refusing to list cloud gaming apps on the Apple App Store. Cloud gaming allows consumers to stream and play video games seamlessly across different devices independent of phone hardware.  </li><li>Limits basic functionality when consumers try to use third-party cross-platform smartwatches with iPhones.</li><li>Restricts digital wallet competitors by allowing only Apple Wallet access to the iPhone's "tap-to-pay" functionality.</li></ul>

<p>Much of this list sounds like it comes straight from an angry user on the Android subreddit, and as a result, people are tripping over themselves to rush to Apple&apos;s defense. However, it&apos;s important to know a few things about the word "monopoly" in this context though, because it&apos;s not what you think.</p><p>The DOJ addresses this in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQQUCm7lcl0">a press conference</a>. The Supreme Court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/atr/monopoly-power-and-market-power-antitrust-law#:~:text=&apos;%20%5BFN34%5D%20By%20contrast%2C,control%20prices%20or%20exclude%20competition.">defines monopoly power</a> as "the power to control prices or exclude competition." As stated in the complaint, Apple has that power in the smartphone market. The DOJ states that while having monopoly power doesn&apos;t necessarily violate antitrust laws by itself, it does "when a firm acquires or maintains a monopoly not because it has a superior product or superior business acumen, but by engaging in exclusionary conduct." </p><p>The Justice Department claims Apple has done just that, just as it claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-justice-department-google-antitrust">Google abused its monopoly power</a> in search. Therefore, the Justice Department must prosecute.</p>
<p>Forget about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ios-17-android-group-chat-workaround">green bubbles</a> and the price of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a> for a moment. A company that can use its influence to stifle competition instead of simply providing a better product is bad for business. It&apos;s bad when Google does it. It&apos;s bad when Amazon does it. It&apos;s equally bad when Apple does it. Even a hint of illegal behavior should be investigated and, if necessary, litigated.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VSGsmjDpiESgUi2DdCH42B" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-review-hero-16-9.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 Plus on a corner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VSGsmjDpiESgUi2DdCH42B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn&apos;t about Google or Android or any other company. It&apos;s about Apple. </p><p>It almost feels like it is, though. It is important to remember the DOJ isn&apos;t doing this so that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-the-real-reason-imessage-isnt-available-android">iMessage can work on Android</a> or so iPhone users can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>. It just so happens that Android is the only competition in these spaces, so a "level playing field" in the U.S. smartphone market means Samsung, Google, and Motorola benefit.</p><p>The DOJ has the Herculean task of holding all tech companies to a set of standards, so we see Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and now Apple at odds over antitrust laws. Whether you think it does a good job at keeping a level playing field makes no difference — it has to try and enforce existing laws and help shape new ones. </p>
<p>Sometimes, that means a company you like ends up in court; sometimes, it&apos;s the company you don&apos;t like. But both times, you benefit.</p><p>If the Justice Department has its way (doubtful) Apple would be forced to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">better integrate iMessage with accepted standards</a>, more work would be done to use third-party smartwatches on the platform, and there would be fewer obstacles when moving from iOS to Android. None of those things may happen; it is still a win for consumers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6" name="pixel-watch-2-final-review-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 while charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No single company should have an insurmountable advantage in the consumer market unless it&apos;s because the products it sells are better in every way, and even then, it should not be able to leverage this to drive competition out of business. And no, your anecdotal evidence doesn&apos;t count; just because you like a thing doesn&apos;t mean everyone does.</p><p>Great artists steal. You&apos;ve heard that before, and whether you want to admit it or not, it&apos;s true. Smartphone software is the epitome of this statement — Samsung, Google, and Apple have been lifting ideas for years, and in the end, we are the beneficiaries. Do you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">enjoy using your phone</a>? If so, thank Palm and BlackBerry.</p><p>If one company is allowed to kill off competition by abusing its position in the market, we are the ones who suffer. Apple isn&apos;t going to thank BlackBerry for iMessage, and Google isn&apos;t going to thank its hardware partners for 50% of Android&apos;s features, but we would not be here without them.</p><p>Being able to kill off your business rivals is against the law for our benefit, and we should welcome seeing investigations like this, even when it&apos;s the company you like.</p>
