                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Qualcomm is hard at work on its next-gen chipset, and we know what it will be called: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. Although the chip vendor doesn&apos;t usually detail its launch plans, we got confirmation of the name as well as the release date. Qualcomm is set to showcase the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 at its annual summit in Hawaii in the month of October.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot to be excited about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4; it is set to feature custom cores that should deliver better performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, along with decent gains in other areas. While the launch is still some way away, a slate of leaks give us a good indication as to what the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will have to offer, so let&apos;s dive in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-snapdragon-8-gen-4-specs"><span>Snapdragon 8 Gen 4: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EvZeHcHxQnKuWQh6ZVRmPV" name="8-gen-3.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvZeHcHxQnKuWQh6ZVRmPV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm is known to switch up the core configuration of its chipsets, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will see the biggest shift in this regard in nearly a decade. That&apos;s down to the introduction of Oryon cores that will be used in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4; the key talking point is that these Oryon cores utilize a fully custom design.</p><p>Qualcomm used a semi-custom design in recent years, where it would basically license Arm cores and add a few custom features, and retain Kryo branding. However, with the Oryon cores, Qualcomm is using Arm&apos;s architectural license; it takes the instruction set from Arm and then builds the core from the ground up, allowing it much better flexibility.</p><p>This is similar to Apple&apos;s approach with its A series chipsets, and although Qualcomm used to do the same in the past, we haven&apos;t seen fully custom cores from the chip vendor following the Snapdragon 805. Qualcomm is once again able to deliver custom designs thanks to its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021.</p>
<p>While details are light at the moment, a leak out of China suggests these custom cores could go up to 4.3GHz, a sizeable increase over the 3.39GHz that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> goes up to. This obviously leads to a higher power draw, and it will be interesting to see how Qualcomm manages thermals.</p><p>Anyway, the return to custom cores should give the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 a sizeable advantage, and close the gap to Apple&apos;s silicon. Although we don&apos;t have many details on the Adreno front, the node shift to 3nm should give Qualcomm more breathing room to increase shaders.</p>

<p>Qualcomm isn&apos;t deviating from its usual launch schedule, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 is set to debut in Hawaii in October. We don&apos;t know the launch date just yet, but if history is any indication, it will be the last week of the month. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> feature Qualcomm&apos;s designs, and with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 launching at the end of October, we should start seeing the first set of devices coming at the end of the year.</p><p>Xiaomi is a launch partner for Qualcomm, and it isn&apos;t unlikely to see the Xiaomi 15 being one of the first phones to feature the upcoming silicon. OnePlus also followed a similar strategy with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, where it launched the device in its home market ahead of global availability, and it&apos;s a good bet that the Chinese manufacturer will seek to do the same this time as well.</p><p>Ideally, it will be early 2025 before we can go hands-on with Snapdragon 8 Gen 4-powered devices. Considering just how good the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 has been, I&apos;m excited in seeing what Qualcomm offers with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, and how those custom cores make a difference.</p>

The A-series started out by bringing features previously limited to Samsung flagships at a much more affordable price point. While it was traditionally focused on the mid-range segment, Samsung merged the entry-level Galaxy J series in 2019 into the Galaxy A lineup.</p><p>The result is that the Galaxy A series now starts under $159, thanks to devices like the Galaxy A03s. While the budget Galaxy A options make it easier to upgrade to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>, the mid-range options like the Galaxy A54 and the A55 offer exciting new features for those who want the latest screen tech and 5G connectivity.</p><p>Samsung clearly did the right thing by broadening focus with its Galaxy A devices, and they now account for nearly 60% of all Samsung phones sales globally. Considering the number of phones available in this series, it can get a bit daunting to find the device that&apos;s ideal for your needs. So if you&apos;re looking to upgrade to a new phone in 2024, these are the best Galaxy A series phones you&apos;ll need to consider.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-galaxy-a55-leading-the-way"><span>Galaxy A55: Leading the way</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.97%;"><img id="kApMyUagbA3AfFaQLb39W7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A35-and-A55-renders-all-colors.jpg" alt="Galaxy A35 and A55 renders showing the front and back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kApMyUagbA3AfFaQLb39W7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2402" height="1945" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy A55 is the latest in the A series, and while it doesn&apos;t differ too much from its predecessor, there are a few new features that are noteworthy. The overall design is largely unchanged, and this is true of any Samsung phone in 2024 — even the Galaxy S24 Ultra is virtually indistinguishable to its predecessor.</p><p>That said, the Galaxy A55 has a marginally larger 6.6-inch screen, and that makes it a smidgen taller and wider than the Galaxy A54. The AMOLED panel itself is the same, and you get the same brightness levels as last year, 120Hz refresh, and FHD+ resolution, but it now has a coating of Gorilla Glass Victus+.</p><p>You get the same set of cameras as last year, and that includes a 50MP main lens, 12MP wide-angle, and a 5MP macro that just doesn&apos;t measure up. The battery is unchanged at 5000mAh, and the Exynos 1480 is nearly identical to the Exynos 1380 that was used in the Galaxy A54, albeit with a slightly higher frequency.</p><p>Although Samsung now guarantees seven software updates to its Galaxy S24 series, the Galaxy A55 gets the same four platform update cycle as its predecessor. Given the sheer number of similarities to last year, it&apos;s understandable that Samsung isn&apos;t launching the Galaxy A55 in the U.S. at all — the brand is directing customers to pick up the Galaxy S24 or S23 FE instead.</p><p>Previous devices in the A5x series sold incredibly well Stateside, and while there isn&apos;t much in the way of new hardware, it&apos;s still bizarre that Samsung isn&apos;t bringing one of its best phones of 2024 to the country.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review">Galaxy A54</a> is over a year old at this point, but it is still the default choice if you want a mid-range Samsung phone in 2024. As I said above, the Galaxy A55 doesn&apos;t really bring anything new to the table, and as the A54 has been on shelves for a while now, there are attractive discounts to be had on the device.</p><p>There isn&apos;t one area where the A54 truly shines, but the combination of a vibrant AMOLED panel, 50MP camera at the back, decent battery, and four Android OS updates make it a good choice. That said, the phone isn&apos;t particularly fast, and isn&apos;t designed for gaming — it still uses Arm&apos;s old v8 cores and doesn&apos;t pass muster when playing demanding titles.</p><p>While you won&apos;t see many slowdowns in daily use, the Galaxy A54 is by no means a powerful phone. But if you don&apos;t intend to play games and want a device that can tackle browsing and social media use, there&apos;s not much to fault with the device. </p><p>If you can get a good deal, the Galaxy A54 is a terrific choice in 2024. </p>

<p>The Galaxy A35 takes the best features of the Galaxy A54 and brings it to an affordable package. It uses the same Exynos 1380 platform, and while it may not be as fast as what you get on the likes of the Pixel 7a, it is better than the Dimensity 100 that was featured on the Galaxy A34 last year.</p><p>You also get a glass back this time around, and it makes the A35 look just that little bit more premium. Samsung didn&apos;t make any changes to the sides, and those are made out of polycarbonate, like last year. The front gets Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection, making it more resilient to tumbles. </p><p>Samsung also offers IP67 ingress protection as standard on its mid-range phones, and that&apos;s the case with the A35. The 50MP camera takes better photos than previous generations, the 6.6-inch 120Hz AMOLED panel gets bright in daily use, and the 5000mAh battery is designed to last a day and a half between charges.</p><p>Unlike the Galaxy A55, the A35 is available in the U.S., and considering just how similar it is to last year&apos;s Galaxy A54, it may be a better choice if you want a new phone this year.</p>

You can get it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced-Expandable/dp/B0CN1Q2X3B">as low as $264 on Amazon</a>, and that is a good value when you consider what you&apos;re getting with the device. As is the case with other Galaxy A models, Samsung didn&apos;t make any changes to the design, and as such the A25 still uses the older waterdrop-style cutout for the camera at the front.</p><p>It has the same 6.5-inch AMOLED screen as last year, but this time, the refresh rate goes up to 120Hz (from 90Hz). You still don&apos;t get ingress protection on the A25; if you need the feature, you&apos;ll need to pick up the A35 instead. The 50MP camera at the back is decent enough in its own right, but it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to what you get on the mid-range Galaxy A devices.</p><p>That said, there&apos;s still an SD card slot, the same 5000mAh battery that you see across the Galaxy A range, and similar software features. At the end of the day, it&apos;s this familiarity that makes the A25 a good overall choice.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15</a> lowers the barrier to entry for 5G quite considerably; the phone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Expandable-Security/dp/B0CN1QSH8Q">available for just $199 on Amazon</a>, and you get a lot for that price. There&apos;s an AMOLED panel with good color vibrancy, and it goes up to 90Hz. The 50MP camera at the back takes decent shots in daylight scenarios, and while it struggles in challenging situations, it is much better than its predecessor.</p><p>The 5000mAh battery lasts two days between charges, and you get One UI 6 based on Android 14 out of the box. Obviously, there are downsides; the Dimensity 6100+ isn&apos;t fast enough, and you&apos;ll see slowdowns and lag in routine everyday tasks. The base model has just 4GB of RAM, and that just isn&apos;t enough — you&apos;ll ideally need to get the 6GB model.</p><p>You don&apos;t get any ingress protection, and the design isn&apos;t quite as modern as the Galaxy A55. But there&apos;s an SD card slot as well as a 3.5mm jack here, and while it won&apos;t win any awards, the Galaxy A15 does a good job delivering the basics.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung will begin rolling out its major One UI 6.1 update starting Thursday (Mar. 28), which brings its AI software to U.S.-based users.</p><p>According to a press release, owners of Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices should begin preparing to download and install the coming update. The Korean OEM states the update is on tap for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series. The update brings these past-gen devices closer to the experience of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>One UI 6.1 features the company&apos;s Galaxy AI software throughout, delivering several on-device features. Kickstarting the update is Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>." Users can run a search based on anything on their Android device without switching to Chrome or another Google-created app.</p><p>Users of past-gen devices can now circle, scribble, highlight, or tap items in images to find more information through Google Search. Moreover, you can write your own query to help guide the search.</p><p>Live Translate is another feature One UI 6.1 brings, enabling users to experience real-time translations during phone calls.</p><p>Chat Assist and Samsung&apos;s Generative Edit arrive to bring some utility to what its Galaxy device owners can utilize. The former, available through the Samsung Keyboard, can help users adjust their "message tone" and translate messages in 13 languages. Generative Edit&apos;s arrival is said to help users "customize their photos" with resizing, removal, and other AI tools for image enhancements.</p><p>Galaxy AI through One UI 6.1 will start rolling out on March 28 on the previously mentioned past-gen devices. Samsung states the update will roll out on devices sold through various carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and USCC.</p><p>Additionally, devices purchased through Amazon, Best Buy, and more will also receive the update.</p><p>Samsung reiterates in its press release that certain Galaxy AI features, like Circle to Search, require an internet connection. The company also informs users that its Galaxy AI features are free, but the company will look to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-plans-to-charge-for-certain-galaxy-ai-features-after-two-years">start charging for them</a> in 2026.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung announces the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) model globally.</li><li>While it looks much like the predecessor model, it packs a new chipset underneath.</li><li>The chipset is believed to be the same Exynos 1280 that powered the Galaxy A53 5G.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Putting an end to multiple leaks and rumors, Samsung finally introduced the third interaction of its Galaxy Tab S6 Lite.</p><p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-style-and-function-in-a-compact-package">announcement post</a>, Samsung shared the details of the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) model, which comes as the successor to the model released in 2022 with the same moniker. Samsung says that the new tablet is “a stylish offering designed for both work and play. “</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.36%;"><img id="Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-render-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1146" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the design front, the new tablet doesn’t have significant changes compared to the predecessor model. It still packs in the same 10.4-inch screen on the front with 2000 x 1200 resolution, and the device, on the whole, measures 7mm in thickness. </p><p>The tablet comes in Wi-Fi and LTE models, weighing around 465 grams and 467 grams, respectively. The color options include Oxford Gray, Chiffon Pink, and Mint, the new color that the company is offering for the first time.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is powered by an octa-core CPU with clock speeds at 2.4GHz. While Samsung doesn’t mention the chipset in the announcement, it is believed that the Exynos 1280 powered Samsung phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review">Galaxy A53 5G</a>. The storage options include 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of onboard storage with additional microSD support for up to 1TB.</p><p>Keeping the lights on the tablet is a massive 7040mAh battery capacity, which promises at least 14 hours of non-stop video playback. </p>

<p>Samsung is emphasizing the S-Pen support on the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024), as it claims to lift the productivity aspect with the help of Samsung Notes on the large screen tablet as users would be able to take notes even without unlocking the device, which is familiar on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and other preceding Ultra models that come with built S-Pen.</p><p>While the tablet doesn’t feature a built-in S-Pen, it comes bundled and sticks to the device, and no separate charging is necessary.

<hr>
<p>Google is beginning to roll out a new update to Chat today (Mar. 26) that brings a long-awaited messaging feature to the platform.</p><p>Google Chat now supports voice messages on its platform, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/03/send-voice-messages-in-google-chat.html">Workspace update</a>. The company states that the feature will only be available on mobile devices with this rollout as it continues to develop a version for desktops. Google states that voice messages in Chat should help users "convey more information" and deliver more emphasis.</p><p>Users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android</a> and iOS can tap the microphone icon beside the image option in a one-on-one or group chat. Chat will begin recording audio; when you&apos;re done, you&apos;ll have the chance to listen to it and re-record if there are mistakes. After that, users can send their recordings.</p><p>Those you&apos;re chatting with can quote, react, and reply to it within a thread. Google teased that it&apos;s also working on adding voice message transcriptions, which should arrive "in the coming months."</p><p>Unfortunately, Google has left personal account holders out of its rollout of voice messages in Chat. The company states Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Essentials Plus, Enterprise Standard, and Enterprise Plus users are eligible to receive it.</p><p>Users on Google&apos;s rapid release schedule will see voice messages arrive today (Mar. 26). They should give the process at least 15 days to complete. Google will shift to the "Scheduled Release" domains on April 15.</p><p>Admins of the previously mentioned domains will find that voice messages are turned on by default.</p>

<p>Google has been working on voice messages in Chat for a while now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-spotted">an interview</a> with the company also stated that its customers had requested the feature quite often. Google stated that a feature like this would help further evolve Chat from a simple text-based app to one that supports multimedia modalities.</p><p>Chat also picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-for-android-gets-starred-messages-feature">an update in February</a> that brought it closer to Messages as users can now "Star" messages. Starring messages in Chat enables folks to rediscover them through search and spot what&apos;s important easily using its bright star icon. Searching for saved or "starred" messages joins users&apos; ability to discover mentions in the app.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has started pushing its latest major camera update to its Galaxy S24 series today (Mar. 26).</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-april-2024-update-camera-improvements-europe/">SamMobile</a>, the latest update is available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">S24</a> trio in Europe, bearing version number S92xBXXU1AXCA. With a focus on its cameras, Samsung&apos;s changelog states it has improved the S24&apos;s white balance accuracy and exposure for its cameras.</p><p>Low light image quality is another area that is receiving an update today. Samsung threw in a few more camera updates, which include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Text clarity in high-zoom shots.</li><li>Color accuracy in the ExpertRAW camera app.</li><li>Support for videos with 480×480 pixels resolution in the Instant Slow Mo feature.</li></ul>

<p>This Galaxy S24 update is hefty, arriving with an approximate 920MB download size. Samsung&apos;s patch notes add that the device has also picked up the April 2024 security patch with these camera improvements. Neither Samsung nor Google have detailed what the April security patch contains just yet.</p><p>Those in Europe should begin noticing the patch today (Mar. 26). With that, it should only be a matter of time before those in other regions, like the U.S., begin picking it up. The patch has also been spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/huge-galaxy-s24-update-improve-camera-quality-released-india/">rolling out in India</a>. If you&apos;d like to check manually, you can head into <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download & Install.</strong></p><p>This is the second camera patch Samsung has created for the Galaxy S24 series, as the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-get-february-security-patch">landed in February</a>. The Korean OEM fine-tuned the image quality and sharpness that its latest flagship launch could provide. The update attempted to improve the low light capabilities of the S24, but it looks like more was required, as we&apos;re seeing it mentioned again.</p><p>That patch also introduced the company&apos;s new Vivid display slider for folks unhappy with the changed profile on the S24 trio.</p><p>Meanwhile, we&apos;re still waiting for the large One UI 6.1 update to drop for Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/signs-point-to-a-one-ui-61-rollout-coming-this-week">might happen soon</a>. A notification from Samsung teased the update in China, stating it could arrive on March 28. It&apos;s still unclear when other regions could see the update, but at least it&apos;s on the way.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra, much like the entire series, is packed full of the company's Galaxy AI software. The device offers a range of on-device tools, capable of handling simple tasks like summarizing long pieces of text and live translations. The S24 Ultra still delivers a stunning, immersive display and multiple cameras strong enough for clear photos and videos.</p></p>

<p>In response to Google&apos;s new Chrome, Qualcomm&apos;s president and CEO Cristiano Amon stated, "The new version of Google Chrome will help cement Snapdragon X Elite&apos;s role as the premier platform for Windows computing starting in mid-2024."</p><p>Qualcomm is going all in on AI with its upcoming Snapdragon X Elite chipset, and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">seems poised</a> to join the journey. The chipmaker is pairing its X Elite chip with its new, stronger Oryon CPU. The chip has been estimated to achieve a CPU speed 2x faster than the competition and AI processing 4.5 times quicker.</p><p>There is hope that Google continues to plug Qualcomm&apos;s new X Elite in more places, namely its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> line, for a massive performance boost.</p><p>Elsewhere, many of the generative AI features Arm-compatible PCs and laptops are preparing to receive include "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help me write</a>." Chrome&apos;s AI update in February lets Workspace users utilize its generative AI software&apos;s "experimental writing AI" to assist them with drafting articles of text. Additionally, users can use information on web pages to help the AI bot form its response to your writing queries.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Pixel 6a has been removed from the US Google Store sale.</li><li>Shoppers are being redirected to the Pixel 7a listing instead.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is expected imminently, with rumors suggesting Google’s I/O event in May as a likely launch date.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Google Pixel 6a</a> marked Google’s first foray into the more affordable sector of the phone market with its refreshed Pixel range. At the time, the handset was very well-received, offering many of the features of its more expensive siblings at a much more affordable price. Having subsequently been replaced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, it appears that the time is drawing near for us to bid the Pixel 6a a fond farewell.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/03/25/google-stops-selling-pixel-6a/">Droid Life</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6a-removed-store-3428543/">Android Authority</a>), the Pixel 6a has been removed from sale on the official US Google Store at some point in the last few days. The phone is no longer available on the site, and if you attempt to access it via an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/gb/config/pixel_7a?hl=en-GB&selections=eyJwcm9kdWN0RmFtaWx5IjoiY0dsNFpXeGZOMkU9In0%3D">old URL</a>, you’ll find yourself on the page for the newer Pixel 7a instead. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YgCoruYwPuJQaXupVMkJmA" name="Google-Pixel-8a-leak.jpg" alt="Pixel 8a hands-on leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgCoruYwPuJQaXupVMkJmA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Abhishek Yadav/ via X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Pixel 6a is unlikely to be a big seller at this stage of its life cycle, the fact it has quietly disappeared indicates that Google is ready to send it to a farm upstate in preparation for a newer device. This is, in all likelihood, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>, which is hotly anticipated to be unveiled shortly. </p><p>A recent report confirmed that a new Google handset – almost certainly the Pixel 8a – has been spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-reaches-us-fcc-listing">FCC databases</a>, lending further weight to its imminent release. The working assumption is that the 8a will be revealed at Google’s I/O event in early May 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-display-upgrade">Other rumors</a> suggest it will be a significant upgrade over the Pixel 7a, which could make it almost as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, anyone who wants to get their hands on a Pixel 6a can still do so from some other retailers, just not directly from Google. The alternative is to consider getting the Pixel 7a, now the only budget handset available on the Google Store. But, given how soon the Pixel 8a is expected to come out, it may be worth hanging on for a few more weeks to see what that handset offers.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-quest-3-price-and-availability"><span>Meta Quest 3: Price and availability</span></h2>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 became publicly available on October 10, 2023. The base 128GB Quest 3 costs $499 / £479 / €549, while the 512GB model is $649 / £619 / €699. </p><p>Aside from storage, you won&apos;t find any other differences, except that all 512GB Quest 3 buyers get six months of free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-plus-subscription">Meta Quest Plus</a>, an $8/month subscription that gives you two Quest games for free, as chosen by Meta.</p><p>We have a guide comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-128gb-vs-512gb">128GB vs. 512GB Quest 3</a> that breaks down the decision. To summarize it briefly, most Quest 3 games measure about 2–3GB in size, but major releases can swell up to 10GB or more — especially with post-launch updates and DLC. 512GB is more than most people need, but if you choose the default 128GB model, you may have to delete games to make space.</p><p>Thankfully, Quest games support cloud storage, so if you do choose the 128GB Quest 3, you can make space in your library and redownload games later.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-quest-3-design-and-display"><span>Meta Quest 3 design and display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mimFbEYQrczyqqaPkENH8f" name="Meta-Quest-3-hands-on-gasket-removed-angle.jpg" alt="The side of the new thinner Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mimFbEYQrczyqqaPkENH8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most visible change to the Meta Quest 3 stems from its pancake lenses, which take up less space than the Quest 2&apos;s fresnel lenses by magnifying through thin, reflective mirrors instead of one thick layer. This makes the Quest 3 headset 40% skinnier in front. </p><p>Despite being skinnier, the Quest 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-quest-3-weighs-more-than-quest-2">weighs slightly more than the Quest 2</a>, which Meta itself attributes to new components like the depth sensor, extra cameras, and depth adjuster. Thankfully, the weight distribution is much more balanced, meaning it&apos;s not all resting on your forehead and slowly creating pressure. </p><p>It&apos;s still going to feel heavy after a while, though. Like the Quest 2, the Quest 3 ships with a cloth strap with velcro to adjust the fit, instead of the built-in Elite Strap with rear padding and adjustment knob you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Quest Pro</a>. </p><p>Unlike the single Quest 2 strap, which could slide to one side of your head, the Quest 3 uses a split overhead strap design that gives you better support but "rubs on the top of your ears," according to our reviewer. </p><p>That&apos;s why we called a Quest 3 strap replacement the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-is-the-one-quest-3-accessory-you-actually-need">"one accessory you actually need."</a> It provides a more comfortable and secure fit, and you can even buy a strap with a built-in battery to improve the Quest 3&apos;s longevity. Since the Quest 3 has a modular design, installing a new strap should only take you a few minutes and doesn&apos;t require any expertise. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nDBZV76enBKAZSWUdzjrQD" name="Meta-Quest-3-hands-on-headset-with-controllers-side-blue.jpg" alt="The USB-C port and power button on the left side of the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nDBZV76enBKAZSWUdzjrQD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A subtle but vital upgrade from the Quest 2 is how you can change how close or far the lenses sit from your eyes, a function built into the facial interface. You&apos;ll choose between four options, with the furthest setting leaving enough room for you to wear glasses without a spacer. </p><p>Plus, there&apos;s the underrated perk that the full-color mixed-reality means you have fewer reasons to <em>take off</em> the headset and worry about adjusting the fit. You can simply double-tap the side to leave your game, see your surroundings, and resolve whatever real-world issue is happening. </p><p>Our one frustration with the new Quest 3 facial design is the lack of venting, which can cause the lenses to fog up from your face&apos;s heat. That&apos;s why you may want to buy a new facial interface that allows for better air circulation. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfy42Q_i944" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Moving on to the Meta Quest 3 display, it uses an LCD, a cost-saving measure that&apos;ll make its colors less vibrant than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a>&apos;s OLED. Putting that aside, though, it&apos;s still a significant visual upgrade over the Quest 2: 2064 x 2208 pixels per eye instead of 1,920 by 1,832 pixels. That gives you an extra 445 pixels per inch (1,218) or 4 pixels per degree (25).</p><p>The PSVR 2&apos;s 2,000 by 2,040 pixels (800ppi) falls short, too, and that headset uses fresnel lenses with a trickier "sweet spot" than the Quest 3&apos;s pancake lenses. For comparison, Meta claims that the new lenses increase visual "sharpness" by 25% by creating "significantly fewer stray or scattered light artifacts." Our experience with the Quest 3&apos;s visual clarity thankfully lives up to Meta&apos;s marketing. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="34jWvW4mHM2HaXcBzLEbJC" name="Meta-Quest-3-hands-on-headset-lenses-02.jpg" alt="Looking closely at the lenses on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34jWvW4mHM2HaXcBzLEbJC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ll also point out that the passthrough resolution is 18 pixels per degree. That&apos;s 7 PPD fewer than its standard VR PPD, but 10X better than the Quest 2 and 3X better than the Quest Pro, enough to make your surroundings fully visible while wearing the headset. In our tests, we found we could read our phone or smartwatch screens without removing our headsets, though it&apos;s still a bit blurry.</p><p>Of course, if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro vs. the Quest 3</a>, you&apos;ll find that the Vision Pro hits 3,386 pixels per inch or 34 pixels per degree, with micro-OLED displays that offer a gorgeous 92% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. But is this resolution boost worth paying an extra $3,000? Frankly, we&apos;re satisfied with what the Quest 3 brings to the table already.</p><p>As a final Quest 3 design point, the newer headset has a redesigned interpupillary distance (IPD) wheel with thirteen spacing settings at 1mm apart. The Quest 2 supported 56–70mm IPDs with three fixed settings, leaving plenty of users stuck with a less-than-ideal distance. Now, anyone from 53–75mm can use it, and finding the right lens spacing will be easier. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-quest-3-specs"><span>Meta Quest 3 specs</span></h2>

<p>One of the main reasons to upgrade from the Quest 2 is the performance gap. The Quest 3&apos;s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 has twice as fast graphical performance and improved loading times compared to the Quest 2&apos;s Gen 1 chip. You also get an extra 2GB of RAM. </p><p>In practice, this allows developers to patch Quest 2 games to add better shadows, lighting, textures, and so on. Plus, of course, you get mixed-reality modes that the Quest 2 can&apos;t support with its low-res, black-and-white passthrough. </p><p>One thing that hasn&apos;t changed with the new generation: the Quest 3 battery life is just as short as the Quest 2&apos;s, if not worse. Meta estimates it lasts 2.2 hours per session or 2.4 hours for gaming, but we&apos;ve found it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-long-does-the-quest-3-battery-last">usually close to 2 hours flat</a> unless you use a battery pack. Once dead, the Quest 3 takes two hours to recharge; it ships with an 18W power adapter and charging cable in the box. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oGtnEn7cUewqXtPJPMCGGG" name="Meta-quest-3-pc-link-cable-01.jpg" alt="A Link cable connected to the USB-C port of the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oGtnEn7cUewqXtPJPMCGGG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm says this chip works with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/wi-fi-7-is-here-but-should-you-care">Wi-Fi 7</a> standard, but Meta has only promised <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wi-fi-6e-router">Wi-Fi 6E router</a> support thus far. The faster Wi-Fi should help with improved PC VR gaming, but you can still stick with a USB-C Link cable for the most reliable connection. </p><p>Meta improved the speaker quality for the Quest 3, claiming it hits a 40% louder volume with increased bass compared to the Quest 2. You still have the 3.5mm headphone jack for private audio and sparing your neighbors, but otherwise, you may not need to buy Quest 3 headphones if you&apos;re happy with the built-in solution. </p><p>If you own the Quest 2 or PSVR 2 and are considering buying this headset, we have guides on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Quest 3 vs. Quest 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-vs-psvr-2">Quest 3 vs. PSVR 2</a> to help you decide. </p>

<p>All of your Quest 2 games will transfer over to the Quest 3, as your account won&apos;t change. Our old list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-games">best Quest games</a> still applies to the new headset, and we can hope to see faster loading times for those games, too.</p><p>From now on, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-games-launching-this-month">upcoming Quest games</a> will release simultaneously on the Quest 2 & 3. Although some of these games will have a unique Quest 3 patch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3-vs-quest-2-graphics-upgrade">enhanced graphics</a>, that&apos;s not a guarantee. The enhanced Snapdragon chip will lower loading times automatically, but many developers cap refresh rates and assets with the Quest 2 in mind, since more people have the older headset.</p><p>For the most part, the only Quest 3 exclusives will be games that require full-color mixed reality, something the Quest 2 can&apos;t offer. </p><p>If you&apos;re a new Quest 3 owner, we&apos;ve recommended the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-quest-3-launch-games">five best Quest 3 launch titles</a> to get you started. </p>

<p>Thus far, Meta has announced these official Quest 3 accessories:</p>
<ul><li>Meta Quest 3 Silicone Facial Interface ($40)</li><li>Meta Quest Active Straps for Touch Plus Controllers ($40)</li><li>Zenni VR Prescription Lenses for Meta Quest 3 ($50)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap ($70)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Carrying Case ($70)</li><li>Meta Quest Link Cable ($80)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap with Battery ($130)</li><li>Meta Quest 3 Charging Dock ($130)</li><li>Meta Quest Touch Pro Controllers ($300)</li></ul>
<p>Most of these names will look familiar. You&apos;ll buy these Quest 3 accessories to improve the battery life, store and charge the headset, play PC VR games, and so on. One new thing to note: you can now buy straps and facial interfaces in new colors like orange and blue, not just the usual white. </p><p>They&apos;re also quite expensive! And in one instance, Meta&apos;s Elite Strap with Battery had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3-elite-strap-battery-charging-defect">a charging firmware issue</a> that required a recall. The current version for sale is fixed, but it still frustrated people that this expensive accessory didn&apos;t work as intended.</p><p>Thankfully, third-party Quest 3 accessory makers like BoboVR, AMVR, and KIWI Design have already made more affordable accessories, with more in the works for later this year. Check our guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Quest 3 accessories</a> to see where to get started. </p><p>Most of your old Quest 2 accessories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/most-quest-2-accessories-wont-work-on-quest-3">won&apos;t work with the Quest 3</a>. Thanks to the redesigns to the new headset, most of this old tech won&apos;t fit properly. We know that some 3rd-party accessory makers like BoboVR have promised to release mod kits to make your old accessories work, but there&apos;s no guarantee every brand will do this.</p><p>So far, we know that your old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-link-cable-alternative-oculus-quest-2">Link cables</a> should continue to work, if you don&apos;t want to rely on Air Link and the new Wi-Fi 6E capabilities for wireless PC VR. And if you own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/are-quest-pro-controllers-worth-buying-for-quest-2">Quest Pro controllers</a> (normally $300), you can use those in place of the Quest 3 Touch Plus controllers. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-quest-3-post-launch-news"><span>Quest 3 post-launch news</span></h2>
<p>These are the main post-launch Quest 3 updates, announcements, and controversies that you&apos;ll want to know about!</p><p>After its early October launch, the Quest 3 received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v59-update-adds-battery-saver-mode-fix">v59 software update</a> that added a battery saver mode, in Meta&apos;s attempt to counteract its short battery life. It also made it easier to set up a mixed-reality space automatically instead of drawing the space manually.</p><p>We learned in November 2023 that Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">tried to get the Play Store on Quest headsets</a>, but Google didn&apos;t want to play ball. We learned later, during some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">public Meta-Google beef</a>, that Google would only provide its apps if Meta agreed to make Quest headsets run fully on Android, with Google in control of software. Because of this, the Quest 3&apos;s productivity software continues to be meager compared to the Vision Pro&apos;s. </p><p>As part of this drama, Meta suddenly disabled Chromecasting at some point last year before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/chromecasting-is-officially-back-on-meta-quest">restoring the feature</a> due to a flurry of Quest user complaints. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b8k5H77TMKux3unQRpbMfk" name="meta-quest-pro-google-play-store-logo.jpg" alt="The Google Play Store logo on the lenses of a Meta Quest Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8k5H77TMKux3unQRpbMfk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We then learned that the Meta Quest 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-manufacturing-cost">costs about $430 to make</a>, meaning that Meta barely makes any profit on headset sales and must recoup its investment in game and accessory sales. </p><p>In December, Meta released the v60 update with new Horizon Home environments and boundary fixes, but it also came with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v60-slowdown-bug">behind-the-scenes bugs</a> slowing down game performance that took Meta some time to update. On the more positive front, this update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-patches-quest-3-mic-issues-after-3-months">resolved longstanding mic issues</a> that plagued fans of social VR games. </p><p>With the February <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-62-update-spatial-video-gesture-controls">Quest v62 update</a> (Meta skipped v61), the Quest 3 made a ton of mixed-reality fixes and updates that seemed to directly target the recently-launched Apple Vision Pro, like support for iPhone 15 spatial videos and a pinch hand gesture. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg proved later that month that Meta had Apple on its mind, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-quest-3-better-product-period-than-vision-pro">"reviewing" the Apple Vision Pro</a> in a Threads video that bashed the rival headset and called the Quest 3 a "better product, period."</p><p>In March, Meta&apos;s CTO Andrew Bosworth started hinting about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-first-details">major Quest UI overhaul</a>, one that&apos;s yet to arrive. He hinted that it will provide a revamped keyboard and put a heavy emphasis on mixed reality, including stationary and pinned menus and apps.</p><p>Most recently, Meta unveiled a new AI-backed feature called SceneScript that will automatically map your room layout, including walls, doors, and furniture. It should make it a lot easier to play in different locations, without having to constantly redraw boundaries. </p>
<hr>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 costs $200 more than the Quest 2 did at launch. In exchange, it delivers significant visual, performance, and comfort upgrades across the board, maintains its wireless design despite the increased power demands, and adds mixed-reality apps. </p><p>Full-color mixed reality lets you tap out of games and clearly see your home space instead of a nauseating black-and-white blur. You can incorporate your surroundings <em>into</em> games like Supernatural, so you never need to worry about accidentally punching a wall. And some MR games make your physical space part of the experience. </p><p>We can assume that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> will take another few years to arrive, but we&apos;ve also heard rumblings about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Quest 3 Lite</a> with the same CPU but several major cuts to hit a $200 price tag, such as shipping without controllers. In theory, if the Quest 3 costs too much, you could wait for its cheaper sibling, so long as you&apos;re willing to accept the trade-offs. </p>

<p>New and existing subscribers alike can save a whopping 42% when they pay for ANY annual streaming plan at Max. No promo code needed, no strings attached. </p>
<p>The result of a merger between HBO and Discovery, Max is home to a bounty of popular TV series and films, from hit series like Succession and The Last Of Us to guilty pleasures like 90 Day Fiancé. This streaming deal could get you a full 12 months of streaming for as little as $69.99 (with the ad-supported plan). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.max.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6bf5990b-a35f-4dd3-98ba-f472ab10833d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Save over 40% on any annual streaming plan at Max" data-dimension48="Save over 40% on any annual streaming plan at Max">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Investing in an entire year of streaming all at once can feel like a big purchase, but the savings really add up when you look at it on a month-to-month basis. Instead of paying $15.99 every month for the popular Ad-Free plan, for instance, you could drop a single $110.99 payment and be streaming to your heart&apos;s content for an entire year. That particular plan also comes with the ability to download up to 30 titles for offline viewing. </p><p>Interested in the most premium streaming experience possible? The 42% off deal also applies to the Ultimate Ad-Free plan, which comes with everything mentioned above alongside 4K Ultra HD streaming on select titles, Dolby Atmos support, and up to 100 titles for offline enjoyment. Pay $139.99 during the promotional period (usually $19.99/month) and you&apos;ll get all of those goodies for an entire year. Max will even throw in the Sports Add-on for 100% free. It&apos;s the best streaming deal we&apos;ve seen in a long time, so don&apos;t miss your chance to save. </p>
