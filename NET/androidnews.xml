<ul><li>HMD has debuted its first original lineup of phones under the "Pulse" series.</li><li>The trio features the same Unisoc T606 CPU and Android 14.

<hr>
<p>HMD Global announces the launch of its "first original" trio of devices dubbed the Pulse series.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/press/hmd-pulse-press-release">press release</a>, HMD states the new Pulse series is the beginning of its commitment to bring self-repairable devices to consumers. Under the "Gen 1 repairability" title, the company adds its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/self-repair">partnership with iFixit</a> should help users quickly find the parts they need if anything goes wrong.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1685px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qGeEYEg45sCmaujaHr8tU4" name="hmd-pulse-pro-purple-hue.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse Pro model in a purple hue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qGeEYEg45sCmaujaHr8tU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1685" height="948" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: hm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The HMD Pulse Pro leads the trio with a 6.6-inch HD+ display. The back of the phone contains a vertical dual camera array featuring a 50 MP AF Dual camera and a 2MP depth sensor. HMD states consumers will find a Super Night and Tripod mode alongside Flash Shot and AI HDR.</p><p>The company adds that the Pulse Pro&apos;s AI Super Portrait mode should help reduce any blurring found during nighttime shots. The front of the device offers a 50MP selfie camera, as well.</p><p>Powering the device is the Unisoc T606 CPU. Additionally, consumers can grab 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The phone supports microSD expansion of up to 256GB.</p><p>HMD packed a 5,000mAh battery into the Pulse Pro, which is estimated to last up to 59 hours and is capable of 20W fast charging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> will greet users out of the box. HMD states it has committed to providing the device, and the rest of the series, with two years of OS updates.</p><p>The HMD Pulse Pro will be available soon in international markets in Glacier Green, Twilight Purple, and Black Ocean.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1785px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.97%;"><img id="yDvSDvHs3ALGiq8DfPKiRm" name="hmd-pulse-plus-model-blue.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse Plus in a blue colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yDvSDvHs3ALGiq8DfPKiRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1785" height="767" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the HMD Pulse Plus, consumers will see the same 6.6-inch HD Plus display with a 90Hz refresh rate as the Pulse Pro. However, the Pulse Plus comes with a lower 8MP front-facing selfie camera. The device&apos;s sleek back panel contains a vertical dual camera array with a 50MP AF Dual Camera and a depth sensor to help "snap quality pictures with ease."</p><p>Interestingly, HMD has kept the same Unisoc T606 CPU for the Pulse Plus, like its Pro sibling. Internally, the device will offer 4GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage, and up to 256GB of expandable storage via microSD.</p><p>Those interested in the HMD Pulse Plus will find the same 5,000mAh battery inside, though it features slower 10W charging capabilities.</p><p>This model is available now in Apricot Crush, Midnight Blue, and Glacier Green.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1791px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.96%;"><img id="F8XwFccGgXyXyJvk8PgdcX" name="hmd-pulse-vanilla-model-pink.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse model in Dreamy Pink." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F8XwFccGgXyXyJvk8PgdcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1791" height="859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last of the trio, the HMD Pulse, remains the same in terms of CPU and display capabilities. The smallest sibling differs with its dual camera array as the device offers a 13 MP AF Dual camera. The front selfie camera remains the same at 8MP.</p><p>HMD has packed the same battery as the Pulse Plus inside the vanilla model with 10W charging and an estimated 59-hour runtime.</p><p>The base model drops slightly for memory and storage as HMD puts it up with 4GB of RAM and only 64GB of internal storage. The device still retains its microSD slot, capable of holding up to 256GB of extra storage.</p><p>Much like the Plus model, the HMD Pulse is available now for international markets. Consumers can find it in Dreamy Pink, Meteor Black, and Atmos Blue colorways.</p><p>While HMD&apos;s initial trio of devices are only for overseas countries, the company informed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/hmd-pulse-pro/">Android Police</a> that it will bring one to the U.S. While specifics weren&apos;t given, it was stated that U.S. consumers will receive the "HMD Vibe," a play-off the HMD Pulse and Pulse Plus models. The device will reportedly go for $149 whenever it finally arrives.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google-backed Indian startup Glance is preparing to finally make its U.S. debut, bringing a unique lock screen experience to Android.</p><p>Unnamed sources reportedly told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/india-glance-pilots-android-lockscreen-platform-in-us/">TechCrunch</a> that Glance has started a "pilot program" with Motorola and Verizon in the U.S. Glance works to deliver recommendations to users like ads, news articles, and more on the lock screen. Sources state the company&apos;s platform does not collect or use user data.</p><p>Instead, Glance operates off a user&apos;s "patterns" in order for the software to operate.</p><p>Moreover, the platform is supposedly discussing ways to build an AI-backed lock screen experience with Qualcomm. Such a move would help Glance reduce the amount of data it requires to function while also moving to on-device processing.</p><p>With Glance moving into the U.S. from India, there are plans to collaborate with telecom operators, CNN, and the NBA. The lock screen experience will reportedly arrive "later this year."</p><p>A statement from Glance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/lock-screen-ads-coming-to-android-phone/#update-2024-04-24-08-09-est-by-rajesh-pandey">Android Authority</a> says the company "does not intend" to ads on consumer devices in the U.S. Glance will side with offering a subscription service where users can pay for "premium news" on their lock screens every month.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that users will have the ability to disable Glance on their device once it officially arrives.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Glance regarding more information surrounding its subscription service. We did not hear back in time for publication but will update this article once we hear back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3971px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="QM6XmV8aWcztyKhotvLXnU" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-review-10.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 backside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QM6XmV8aWcztyKhotvLXnU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3971" height="2234" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pilot program source alluded to for Glance in the U.S. has already arrived on some devices, including the Moto G Power 5G. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024 review</a>, Glance&apos;s appearance on the device was questionable at best, and it felt a little intrusive. What&apos;s more, the platform tosses news recommendations at you, which seems a little redundant, considering Google&apos;s Discovery page is a swipe away from your home screen.</p><p>Fortunately, you can disable Glance on the phone, but we found that the service would occasionally produce a full-screen prompt on the lock screen, encouraging you to re-enable the feature.</p><p>We first heard about Glance in 2022, and it&apos;s not entirely clear what&apos;s taken the company so long to arrive in the U.S. It was stated two years ago that the company amassed 400 million users before it set eyes on the U.S. market.</p><p>Glance will seek to make a profit through the aforementioned subscription and if users interact with its "product of the day."</p>

<p>A recent report suggests Google will upgrade its Gemini Nano AI model in time to roll out with Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S25 series next year.</p><p>The report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://v.daum.net/v/20240417104601886">Daum Herald Economy</a> (Korean) following an interview with Samsung&apos;s executive director of systems, Cho Cheol-min (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-gemini-nano-2-ai-features-3436802/">Android Authority</a>). It was stated that discussions between Samsung and Google have already started as the brands look to "evolve" on-device AI in the next trio.</p><p>Cho stated, "We have started discussing how to implement version 2 of Google’s ‘Gemini Nano’ in on-device AI." He added that Samsung would have a "private" meeting with the company to discuss how they could further develop AI for the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Samsung continues to focus on its AI efforts, with Cho reportedly expressing how AI has allowed consumers to "actually experience AI." The company feels that phones are a better outlet than PCs for users to experience AI&apos;s capabilities.</p><p>Cho stated that the company is looking to double the number of people working toward on-device AI capabilities through its Exynos chipset. He stated around 200 people are involved in developing on-device AI for Exynos. He hopes that number reaches 400 "within the year."</p><p>Additionally, Samsung&apos;s executive director teased the possibility of a solution that blends on-device AI with cloud-based AI services.</p>

We&apos;ve seen smartphones widely adopt 120Hz displays in the past few years, while the PC gaming side of things has seen monitors launch at 360Hz and beyond. But the refresh rate you see with your eyes isn&apos;t the only refresh rate you should care about.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> recently launched with a PWM refresh rate of 4,320Hz, eclipsing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-90-and-magic-5-pro-display-benefits">previous record Honor set</a> with the Honor 90 and Honor Magic 5 Pro last Summer. That number is becoming more and more important as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">ultra-bright phone displays</a> are becoming more common, helping to alleviate eye strain when using these phones in bed at night.</p><p>But while an increasing number of companies are starting to advertise elevated PWM refresh rates, very few of them are willing to talk about the technology behind the glass. It&apos;s great to see attention paid to a topic that could affect millions of smartphone users, but it&apos;s also frustrating to see a lack of transparency from the companies behind the change movement.</p>

<p>Industrial espionage is a term for a reason. Companies that develop complicated, profit-making products don&apos;t want to reveal their secrets to the rest of the world to be easily copied. That problem has accelerated tenfold in an era where products can be cloned on production lines and sold under a random brand name on Amazon.</p><p>In just the past two years, we&apos;ve seen substantial competition in the display market from names like BOE, China Star, and Visionox, names you may have never even heard of until this article. Until these companies came along, an OLED panel on your favorite device was almost assuredly made by Samsung or LG.</p><p>However, Samsung&apos;s dominance in the AMOLED market meant that any decisions the company made ultimately trickled down to companies using Samsung displays in their products. As any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> person will tell you, Samsung AMOLED panels are the worst type of display for eye health.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Honor uses a BOE panel that gets to 5,000 nits brightness under the right conditions, yet it uses fascinating technology to ensure it's not searing your retinas.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unironically, none of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-phones-for-pwm-flicker-sensitive">best phones for PWM-sensitive people</a> have displays made by Samsung. That&apos;s because some of Samsung&apos;s biggest features rely on flickering the display to trick your eyes into seeing something that&apos;s not actually there, and it wreaks havoc in some people&apos;s brains — including myself.</p><p>That&apos;s part of why I was so excited to get to use the Honor Magic 6 Pro, as its PWM rate is 10x the refresh rate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">of the Galaxy S24 series</a>, ensuring that I&apos;m able to use it for long periods of time.</p><p>While that&apos;s great — and it means I can finally use a phone with a comfortable display <strong>and</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">a good camera</a> — Honor&apos;s method of achieving this high rate is far from conventional. In short, that means it doesn&apos;t work for everyone.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QUgEftJtMQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Without getting into the weeds, my light meter can&apos;t properly read the backlight refresh frequency of the Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s display, even though I can see what&apos;s happening with a camera. It&apos;s a side effect of Honor doing something "weird" with its display, so I asked the company to go into a bit more detail on it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Honor's display panel works differently from any other I've tested, and while that works well for me, it doesn't for some folks.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, all I was met with was a disappointing "sorry, we can&apos;t provide further details on this technology."</p><p>This makes it difficult to understand why this phone works incredibly well for my eyes but instantly causes pain for other flicker-sensitive users. It&apos;s a problem I&apos;ve had with other companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-pwm-frequency">like Google</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">Samsung</a>, who both have refused to comment or provide additional details on how their displays work beyond what each company&apos;s marketing department provides.</p><p>Meanwhile, Motorola continues to be one of the only companies that will discuss the topic at length with me. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-display-flickering">They even boasted</a> how their flicker-reduction technology ensures that the display is on 99.51% of each duty cycle, a more technical term I&apos;ve never heard from any other company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iteBDJ5eAY4RZ4N9yBiN5U" name="Motorola-Edge-Plus-2023-display-playing-games-genshin-impact.jpg" alt="Playing Genshin Impact on the Motorola Edge+ (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iteBDJ5eAY4RZ4N9yBiN5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Motorola is one of the only companies talking about how it actively performs market research to find out how much of its customer base is negatively affected by display flicker.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Motorola has even disclosed to me that it performs market research studies specific to display flicker in an attempt to figure out how many Motorola customers are negatively affected by flicker.</p><p>This is the kind of market-leading behavior I expect from a company like Samsung that could potentially negatively affect the health of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It&apos;s just as important as ensuring that phones don&apos;t emit harmful radiation, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/specific-absorption-rate-sar-cellular-telephones">all manufacturers have to do</a> before getting approval by governing bodies like the FCC.</p><p>Thankfully, I was able to sit down with Bill Maffucci from Kopin Corporation, a company that specializes in creating displays and lenses for XR devices, to discuss some of the finer points of how displays work. It was a refreshing conversation and it helped me understand the tenuous relationship between technologies like PWM and LTPO.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Technologies like PWM and LTPO complicate the already complicated nature of OLED panels, and companies aren't particularly willing to divulge how these work together.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Maffucci explained that an OLED display can light up and turn off in microseconds — one microsecond is one millionth (0.000001) of a second — meaning that companies now have options for dimming that they never had with LCDs. Couple that with the fact that reducing voltage on an OLED panel too much can cause bad color reproduction and noise, and you&apos;ll quickly understand why companies have started using PWM — which flickers the display on and off rapidly — more often to control brightness.</p><p>However, this becomes even more complicated when you throw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-does-ltpo-mean-and-why-is-it-important-on-your-device">LTPO</a> into the mix, a technology that adjusts the refresh rate of the display based on what&apos;s happening on screen. But while this sounds like it would interfere with the "backlight" cycle on an OLED, Maffucci confirmed to me that most LTPO OLEDs don&apos;t actually adjust the refresh rate of the display itself.</p><p>Rather, what&apos;s being adjusted is the graphics driver&apos;s rendering rate, and it&apos;s usually performed at a number that divides evenly into the display&apos;s <em>actual</em> refresh rate. For Honor, that means the 360Hz rate further complicates the situation in ways the company isn&apos;t willing to divulge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.97%;"><img id="vaLAyta5rHuonWbvKkQSdg" name="honor-keep-your-secrets-frodo.jpg" alt="A meme of Frodo Baggins" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vaLAyta5rHuonWbvKkQSdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="1757" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / New Line Cinema)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve noticed that more people than ever are flocking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://reddit.com/r/PWM_Sensitive/">PWM-sensitive online communities</a>, and I think it&apos;s both a combination of more flickering displays than ever plus people&apos;s raised awareness that this is a real issue — not just something in their imagination.</p><p>Even Google is playing around with new brightness controls at the system level, purportedly baking in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-even-dimmer-setting-spotted">new "even dimmer" option</a> into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. While that <em>could</em> help some people, the existing "extra dim" option in Android seems to wreak havoc on sensitive eyes.</p><p>However, the trend for more eye-friendly mobile displays has substantially improved over the past year. Companies like Motorola are leading the way, but display manufacturers like BOE, Visionox, and China Star all seem to recognize that something needs to change to prevent more widespread problems from happening.</p><p>Now, if we could only get companies to be a little less secretive about things that are problematic to their users&apos; health, that would be great. Regardless, I&apos;m happy to see companies like Honor trying to make better displays, even if the company doesn&apos;t want to reveal its secrets just yet.</p>

<hr>
<p>President Biden has signed a bill into law that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/tech/congress-tiktok-ban-what-next/index.html">CNN reports</a>. This comes just days after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-ban-just-got-the-houses-nod-and-it-might-be-law-real-soon">House approved the bill</a> and a day after the Senate voted in favor of it.</p><p>Nestled within a foreign aid package, the bill would make it so that app stores such as Google&apos;s Play Store and Apple&apos;s App Store can not legally offer TikTok within the United States. However, the ban does not happen overnight, as the bill gives TikTok owner ByteDance less than a year (270 days) to divest the app and find a potential buyer.</p><p>In response to the bill being signed into law, TikTok CEO Shou Chew took to the app to express his thoughts on the matter, saying, "We aren&apos;t going anywhere."</p>

<p>Chew points out that of the more than 170 million users on the platform, more than 7 million business owners rely on TikTok for their livelihoods and urges users to post videos about how the app impacts their lives. He also notes that TikTok will continue to invest in keeping its community "vibrant, exciting, and safe."</p><p>"Through our U.S. security efforts, we have built safeguards that no other peer company has made. We have invested billions of dollars to secure your data and keep our platform free from outside manipulation."</p><p>TikTok has been under fire over the past several years for its close ties to the Chinese government via parent company ByteDance, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-us-lawkmakers-want-tiktok-banned">lawmakers expressing concerns about U.S. data</a>. The U.S. has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-senate-bans-tiktok-app-from-government-devices">banned the app on government-issued devices</a>. Meanwhile, efforts to alleviate these concerns have largely failed, leaving the future of TikTok unclear for the app and its users. The question also remains whether or not ByteDance will be allowed to divest TikTok.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to TikTok for a comment on the bill being signed into law but did not receive a response in time for publication. However, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that the company found the ban "unconstitutional" and that TikTok would continue to challenge the decision.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>So you&apos;re done using a big bloated app and want to make sure you get all those precious phone resources back. Most of us just move on to the next app and forget about it, but plenty of other folks think you should dig in there and make sure it&apos;s fully closed. Which way is right?</p><p>Both are fine. Force-closing an app isn&apos;t going to hurt anything, and sometimes I do it. I&apos;ll say up front that if I grant any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11-features-we-love-one-time-permissions">one-time permissions</a> to an app when I open it, I&apos;ll swipe that app away as soon as I&apos;m finished. Even <em>that</em> is probably unnecessary, though.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s take a look at what&apos;s happening and why you may want to just let Android do it&apos;s thing instead of trying to manage one more thing on your phone.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-force-closing-an-app-really-mean-2">What does force closing an app really mean?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EbiLxT6SNFKqGuToJnVNmN" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-multitasking-04.jpg" alt="The larger cover display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EbiLxT6SNFKqGuToJnVNmN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When used as a computing term, force-closing means terminating a running process. Depending on the platform, you might see the words kill, SIGHUP, SIGKILL, or SIGTERM used to mean the same thing. All these do the same thing—send a signal to the operating system to terminate (not suspend) a running process, though they do it in slightly different ways.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-bash" language="bash" ><code>killall -o 30m chrome

# This sends a request for a graceful shutdown 
# of all instances of Chrome that have been 
# running longer than 30 minutes</code></pre>
<p>However, this doesn&apos;t mean an app is closed because many apps use more than one process. Apps doing tasks in the background (not visible on your screen) act differently and have different rules. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-android-compatibility-definitions-prohibits-using-androids-camera-apis-alter-facial">Android&apos;s APIs</a> are built around this; unless you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-rooting-and-modding">rooted your phone</a> or are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://llamalab.com/automate/doc/block/app_kill.html">using an app with elevated privileges</a>, this is how it works. </p><p>If you&apos;re doing either of these things, you&apos;re probably not reading an article like this looking for answers. For our purposes, force closing means opening the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-beta-2-teases-app-pair">overview of your open apps</a> and swiping one or more away. This closes the process of that app running in the foreground, and as far as we can tell, it&apos;s closed.</p>
<p>Back to the multiple processes used by most apps. Apps periodically do things even if they aren&apos;t "open" or you haven&apos;t used them recently. Sometimes, these are useful things, like a social media app telling you about notifications that you asked it to tell you about. </p><p>Other times, it&apos;s not so useful, like free ad-based apps that get your location and report it.</p><p>I&apos;ll reiterate — unless you&apos;re doing something that elevates permissions, you can&apos;t stop this from happening. It&apos;s how the operating system works because it&apos;s how an operating system <em>has</em> to work. All computer operating systems that have any sort of multitasking allow processes to open to perform background tasks. And yes, this can have an effect while it&apos;s happening, but it soon finishes. You will probably never notice it.</p>
<p>We&apos;re not able to control these processes, but what about the ones we can see on our screen? Once it isn&apos;t in our face, it&apos;s mostly suspended, but we can push it out of view by swiping it away and forcing it to be closed. But you don&apos;t really need to do it.</p>
<h2 id="resource-management-2">Resource management</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.43%;"><img id="ZuVZHoWYcrZkBtLbo6nYPK" name="multiple-windows-samsung-dex-classic-1.jpg" alt="Multiple app windows open in Classic DeX" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZuVZHoWYcrZkBtLbo6nYPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2960" height="1848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android was designed to be very aggressive regarding killing processes and freeing resources. Since it was designed for machines with mobile application processors, no real way of keeping them cool, and only a battery to power them, it can&apos;t let things run amok. </p><p>One of the ways <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-makes-pixel-more-memory-efficient-first-feature-drop">Android manages resources</a> is by killing processes that aren&apos;t being used to open new ones. You could keep opening process after process until you run out of memory, but your device would perform horribly.</p>
<p>The company that made your device fine-tuned these settings to keep processes alive as long as possible (in case they are needed again) while keeping performance acceptable. Some of these settings deal with background processes so everything that needs to be done <em>can</em> be done, and others deal with what we see on our screens.</p><p>If you swipe an app away to try and push it out of your memory, that space won&apos;t stay free for long. The operating system doesn&apos;t want it to stay empty because this is one of those times where free RAM really is wasted RAM. Having available memory with nothing in it doesn&apos;t benefit you in any way. Some systems, like Microsoft Windows, were designed to have a set amount of RAM free and empty if possible. Your Android device isn&apos;t one of them.</p>
<p>Swiping apps away as soon as you&apos;re done using them isn&apos;t going to hurt anything. It&apos;s also not really helping anything. This is one case where you can safely ignore it and just enjoy using your phone.</p>

A lot of that is down to the hardware; the Open has a gorgeous design, smooth hinge with no visible crease, excellent internal hardware, a larger battery than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, 67W charging, and terrific cameras.</p><p>While there were software issues out of the box, these have been addressed with updates. With the Open gaining decent momentum, it&apos;s now time to take a look at what the Open 2 could bring to the table once it launches later this year. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-design"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK" name="oneplus-open-35.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus designed the Open in collaboration with OPPO, and that&apos;s immediately evident when viewing the device next to the Find N2. In fact, the Find N3 is identical to the Open, with the only difference being that it is limited to China, whereas the Open is sold in global markets. </p><p>As such, it is unlikely we&apos;ll see any major design change with the Open 2. While OPPO likes to switch up the design of its Find X devices — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> has a distinct design that stands out — it has maintained the same styling to all of its foldables, and that isn&apos;t likely to change. </p><p>What could be different is a new hinge that is even lighter than the previous generation. Honor has the distinction of the thinnest foldable in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, and as this is a key area of contention between all the Chinese manufacturers, it is entirely likely the Open 2 will feature a redesigned hinge. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-specs"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Open has an outstanding hardware package, and that is set to continue with the Open 2. The upcoming foldable will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it should retain the same 67W charging tech. </p><p>OnePlus isn&apos;t messing with battery tech this year, and while it has 150W charging available, it isn&apos;t usable in North America, so for devices that are launching globally, it is limiting the charging potential to 100W or 67W. Considering the limited room on a foldable, I don&apos;t see any changes in this area. </p><p>Having said that, the Open 2 is likely to include a larger battery that lasts noticeably longer. There hasn&apos;t been any confirmation about the battery size, but OnePlus is said to offer up to a 5000mAh battery on the foldable. </p><p>The rest of the hardware is likely to be unchanged, but I&apos;ll update this post once we have credible details. </p>

<p>OnePlus did all the right things when it comes to the Open cameras, with the foldable offering a fabulous set of lenses at the back. With 2024 phones pushing the boundaries of camera tech — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, Find X7 Ultra, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> all have sizeable gains — the Open 2 should have some of these gains baked in. </p><p>Then again, considering the launch window of the Open 2, it could be a while before we know what camera hardware the device is packing to any reasonable degree. What you need to know at this point is that the cameras should be on the same level as the OnePlus 12, and that&apos;s a terrific starting point. </p>

<p>OnePlus is targeting the same launch window as last year, but it is moving things up a little, so get ready to see the Open 2 sometime before the month of October. </p><p>An earlier launch positions the Open 2 against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and with OnePlus following a similar stance with the OnePlus 12 at the start of the year, the Open 2 should debut before the end of Q3 2024. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-what-i-want-to-see"><span>OnePlus Open 2: What I want to see</span></h2>
<h2 id="oneplus-needs-to-add-wireless-charging-2">OnePlus needs to add wireless charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM" name="oneplus-open-39.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t know who signed off on not including wireless charging on the OnePlus Open, but it is the biggest limitation on the device. Sure, the phone was designed in conjunction with OPPO, and the Chinese manufacturer doesn&apos;t offer wireless charging on its own devices — so you don&apos;t get one here.</p><p>However, the Open is sold in a lot of global markets, and with OnePlus positioning it as the ideal alternative to Samsung in North America, it needed to nail the table stakes features. While the battery life itself is much better than Samsung&apos;s foldables, the fact that it is limited to wired charging — no matter how fast — makes it a little less enticing.</p><p>With the Open 2, OnePlus has to rectify this particular issue and offer wireless charging out of the box. While it&apos;s okay for a device like the OnePlus 11 to miss out on it, the Open costs nearly thrice as much at $1,699, and not having the ability to charge wirelessly is a shortsighted move.</p>
<h2 id="polished-software-out-of-the-box-2">Polished software out of the box</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF" name="oneplus-open-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a regular complaint with all OnePlus phones, but I want to see better software out of the box with the Open 2, not a few months down the line. Yes, the ColorOS integration made things that much more difficult, but it&apos;s been two years now, and that cannot be the excuse to deliver shoddy software on every new phone.</p><p>OnePlus has shown that it can deliver; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> was devoid of any major bugs, and it was optimized for the hardware. I know achieving the same on a foldable is twice as hard as there are two screens to deal with and numerous scaling issues, but the Open 2 has to do better. And while we&apos;re at it, can I get a 5x5 grid? I still don&apos;t understand why that isn&apos;t available on the Open.</p>
<h2 id="ipx8-water-resistance-2">IPX8 water resistance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C" name="oneplus-open-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Open has IPX4 water resistance, and that means that it can withstand an occasional splash of water. OnePlus says that the hinge automatically ejects any dust that manages to get in, and even though it isn&apos;t tested, it should do a decent job with any dust ingress as well.</p><p>That said, I&apos;d like to see IPX8 water resistance on the Open 2. That would make the foldable that much more resilient to the elements, and bring it to parity with Samsung&apos;s foldables.</p>
<h2 id="stylus-integration-would-be-nice-to-have-2">Stylus integration would be nice to have</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is another one of those features that feels motivated by OPPO. As the brand doesn&apos;t pay particular attention to global markets, adding stylus integration wasn&apos;t a priority, and the Open misses out on it. I&apos;m not saying the foldable should have come with a stylus in the box — even Samsung isn&apos;t that generous — but the ability to use a stylus with the inner screen makes the foldable that much more useful.</p><p>Even if OnePlus decides it doesn&apos;t want to bother making its own stylus, there are plenty of aftermarket styli that do a great job with note-taking and doodling. I have a half-dozen styli in the house, and while I don&apos;t really use them as much as I should, having the option to do so on the Open 2 would go a long way.</p>

<hr>
<p>There was a bittersweet feeling for fans of Google&apos;s Nest Hub lineup when it unveiled the Google Pixel Tablet because it seemed to doom the future of the company&apos;s dedicated smart displays. However, there are now indications that the five-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> might finally receive a much-needed refresh. While the current Nest Hub Max is still a solid smart home controller despite being released first in 2019, there are a few things about the display that make it feel ancient.</p><p>In version 3.16 of the Google Home app, references to a new and unreleased Nest Hub Max model were uncovered in an APK teardown by the team at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/23/new-nest-audio-hub-max-spotted/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The report says that the unknown device is clearly listed as a Nest Hub Max in code for the Google Home app, leaving little room for different interpretations. It also notes that this new device won&apos;t be powered by Android, and will instead use the same Fuchsia OS that powers current Nest Hub displays.</p><p>This all but confirms that a potential next-generation Nest Hub Max will still keep its smart display identity and not follow in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>&apos;s footsteps. That device runs Android but also features a smart display mode that makes it comparable in functionality to Nest Hub devices. Google could have easily pivoted its strategy with a subsequent Nest Hub Max, ditching Fuchsia for its new Android smart display mode.</p><p>That said, it certainly looks like Google is planning to freshen up its smart home offerings this year. The same report reveals that a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest Audio</a> product might be on the way, while a prior report shared that Google is likely planning to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-successor-may-come-soon-new-remote">launch a new Chromecast with Google TV 4K</a>. </p><p>We don&apos;t know when (or if) this upgraded Nest Hub Max might launch. Still, let&apos;s take a look at why the smart display still has a place in Google&apos;s 2024 product lineup and what we want to see.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-pixel-tablet-and-nest-hub-max-need-to-coexist-2">Why the Pixel Tablet and Nest Hub Max need to coexist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF" name="google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max next to Pixel Tablet on countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">compare the Pixel Tablet and the Nest Hub Max</a>, it might be easy to declare the Pixel Tablet as the clear winner at first glance. However, in reality, it&apos;s much more complicated than that. The obvious difference between these two devices is the price: the Pixel Tablet starts at $500, while the Nest Hub Max costs $230. Both devices are frequently available at a discount, but the Nest Hub Max can be bought for under $200 easily during deals holidays like Black Friday. </p><p>So, the Pixel Tablet is not a one-size-fits-all solution for your smart home needs simply because it costs double the price of the Nest Hub Max. It&apos;s true that the Pixel Tablet is, well, a tablet — and that makes it a great value for people who are in the market for <em>both</em> an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> <em>and</em> a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">smart display</a>. I was in the market for something like a Pixel Tablet or a Nest Hub Max late last year, but when it came down to it, I ended up buying the latter because I simply didn&apos;t need a tablet. </p><p>The Pixel Tablet has clear versatility benefits, but it isn&apos;t the best for every situation. For starters, the included speaker docking station generally doesn&apos;t sound as good or as loud as the Nest Hub Max. Additionally, the Pixel Tablet doesn&apos;t include a Thread radio, so you can forget setting up your Nest Audio hardware as the device&apos;s default speaker outputs. If you need a smart home controller first and foremost, the five-year-old Nest Hub Max is still the cream of the crop. </p>
<h2 id="what-i-want-to-see-in-a-nest-hub-max-refresh-2">What I want to see in a Nest Hub Max refresh</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dbdsrJHiobNCod6MigjEqP" name="Nest-Hub-Max-1.jpg" alt="The Nest Hub Max sitting on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbdsrJHiobNCod6MigjEqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s not to say that the current Nest Hub Max isn&apos;t desperately in need of a refresh. The display is perhaps the biggest thing in need of an upgrade, especially when compared to the Pixel Tablet. The white bezels of the Nest Hub Max display are massive and look incredibly outdated compared to the slimmer bezels on the Pixel Tablet. </p><p>The Nest Hub Max can also feel slow at times and doesn&apos;t respond to requests perfectly in others. A hardware upgrade and software improvements would be greatly appreciated by Nest Hub Max owners, and these might prepare the Nest Hub Max to move away from Google Assistant. Google appears to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">shifting away from Assistant and moving to Gemini</a>, and new internal components might help Gemini power a new smart display. </p><p>Google will likely take notes from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">second-generation Nest Hub</a>, which added a new sensor for tracking sleep quality. This probably doesn&apos;t matter as much on the Max because it is better suited for countertop use, but it seems like an easy inclusion.</p><p>We hope that pricing for a second-gen Nest Hub Max will remain competitive and ideally stay at $230. If there&apos;s a true and meaningful overhaul, a price of around $250 is still justifiable, but a price bump that nears $300 would overlap with the Pixel Tablet. </p>
<hr>
<p>With rumors swirling about various unreleased Google hardware products, all eyes are on Google I/O, as we expect to see at least one of them at the developer-focused event. The budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-live-images-show-mint-and-bay-colors">Pixel 8a</a> smartphone looks to be the most likely product to launch at I/O, but it&apos;s also possible Google surprises us with something like a Chromecast or Nest device. Even if no smart home hardware products debut, Google might discuss its software strategy at I/O instead. Either way, if you&apos;re interested in Google&apos;s smart home efforts, it&apos;s worth keeping tabs on I/O and our coverage of the mid-May event.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio is a powerhouse when it comes to the budget segment, and the brand continues to roll out options that excel at value. The JH5 illustrates this quite well; the IEMs have a hybrid driver that sees a dynamic driver paired with four balanced armature drivers, and it has a new design that looks modern.</p><p>Best of all, the JH5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-JadeAudio-JH5-Detachable-Audiophile/dp/B0CMHB2BQ1">costs just $79 on Amazon</a>, making it an unbelievable value. Like the JD3 and JD7, the JH5 is branded under the Jade Audio label, but it stands out quite a bit from the brand&apos;s other offerings. On that note, Fiio sells the JH5 in two options: black and silver. The silver version in particular looks terrific, and it doesn&apos;t look like a budget product in the least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cJZehoRcZDtGQjRUTRBAjL" name="fiio-jh5-11.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJZehoRcZDtGQjRUTRBAjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of that has to do with the new design. The JH5 has a 3D-printed acrylic shell, and it has a clear design that lets you view all the parts housed underneath. You can make out the dynamic drivers, the four BA drivers, and even the individual driver chambers that ensure there&apos;s no crossover between frequencies. I&apos;m a big fan of see-through designs, and this is what I wanted Nothing to do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a> — actually show off the hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SF7ZipmZdqoUJVVYkrWKMN" name="fiio-jh5-19.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SF7ZipmZdqoUJVVYkrWKMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The JH5 fits comfortably thanks to the contoured shell design, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in that area. It doesn&apos;t exert too much pressure on the ear canal, and the shells are lightweight enough that you don&apos;t notice any fatigue with extended use. The vent at the back has a grille, and on the whole, the IEMs are great for casual listening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aPp9HfSjHwC8qXBTRiGobL" name="fiio-jh5-14.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPp9HfSjHwC8qXBTRiGobL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio went with a faceplate featuring a zinc alloy, and it looks modern. The design blends seamlessly with the shell, and again, it conveys a sense of elegance that makes the JH5 look much more premium than its price tag suggests. That said, the glossy texture is prone to smudging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f7us4jxBFfnG8nw5PeUXCL" name="fiio-jh5-10.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7us4jxBFfnG8nw5PeUXCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Build quality is outstanding, and in the four months I used the JH5, I didn&apos;t see any problems with the fit and finish of the product. The bundled silver-plated cable is of a good quality as well, and it has standard 2-pin connectors; I liked the cable so much that I used it with a half-dozen IEMs. It has a 3.5mm connector with an angled design, and while a 4.4mm balanced port would have been ideal, the single-ended jack is good enough.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v56ygA5ZKLw2Q6LCDSJSCN" name="fiio-jh5-18.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v56ygA5ZKLw2Q6LCDSJSCN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also get a good selection of silicone ear tips bundled in the package, but what I like the most is the HB11 storage case. The slide-out case offers excellent protection, and it has a slotted design that lets you stack it with other cases — or even mount Lego minifigs. While I like the design of the case, it isn&apos;t exactly portable, and is considerably larger than most IEM cases you get in this segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K392ZiacimYDEGsGNnuSnK" name="fiio-jh5-2.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K392ZiacimYDEGsGNnuSnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a sensitivity of 112dB and 13Ω, the JH5 can be easily driven by any source. But as always, you&apos;ll make the most out of the drivers by pairing the buds with a good portable source; a dongle DAC like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">KA11</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka13-review">KA13</a> makes a big difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5idmYBobTz8zS3dRxGuQ5L" name="fiio-jh5-5.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5idmYBobTz8zS3dRxGuQ5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The JH5 retains Fiio&apos;s characteristic sound, but you get much better vibrancy, particularly in the low-end. Bass notes have a satisfying rumble and texture, and the sub-bass has good definition that makes listening to bass-focused tunes highly enjoyable. Mids are similarly detailed, and while the vocal presentation isn&apos;t as natural as Fiio&apos;s other hybrid driver designs, it is clear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LVrbUEikPgoUVPFj4R3QMM" name="fiio-jh5-4.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVrbUEikPgoUVPFj4R3QMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Treble is decent in its own right, but it has limited extension. You don&apos;t get any sibilance though, and given the tweaks to the tuning, it&apos;s clear that Fiio designed the JH5 for casual listening sessions and not necessarily as a technical set.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9mSfyRgUPsRgp82QqQdArL" name="fiio-jh5-13.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mSfyRgUPsRgp82QqQdArL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, there is a lot to like with the JH5. The design gives the IEMs a distinct presence, and while the case is just too big, I like the quirkiness on offer. The IEMs have excellent isolation in addition to a comfortable fit, and the cable is one of the better options in this segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dethwncB39q7BqAmYfWPBM" name="fiio-jh5-9.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dethwncB39q7BqAmYfWPBM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The JH5 doesn&apos;t have the same technical prowess as Fiio&apos;s other hybrid drivers, but the sound is highly enjoyable, and the exuberant bass combined with vibrant mids make it fun to use with a lot of genres. Ultimately, it&apos;s the value that makes the JH5 such a good choice — you&apos;re getting a standout sound along with an elegant design and a decent amount of accessories.</p>

<ul><li>In an expansive update, Meta rolled out multimodal AI support and video call capabilities to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses users. Multimodal AI is in beta for all U.S. and Canadian users, while video call support is rolling out gradually.</li><li>Earlier, Meta quietly added Apple Music as a supported service in the Meta View app, allowing for hands-free control.</li><li>Meta is also adding a new frame option called Skyler and a low-bridge option for Headliner frames.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta spent the last week reminding everyone in the tech industry that it is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to AI. The company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">launched a new Llama 3 AI model</a> and integrated Meta AI into its core apps. Now, the Meta AI experience on its Ray-Ban smart glasses is getting upgraded to multimodal AI, putting it in the same league as new AI hardware products like the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1. </p><p>The company explained the updates in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-styles-and-meta-ai-updates/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, which also include support for POV-style video calling and two new frame styles. Separately, Meta quietly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/smart-glasses/articles/ray-ban-meta/apple-music-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/" target="_blank">added Apple Music support</a> in the Meta View app, enabling hands-free music control and playback. </p><p>The company began testing multimodal AI with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses a few months ago, combining the glasses&apos; camera with Meta AI. The term "multimodal" means that you can interact with Meta AI through different modes. The glasses first shipped with voice control, which was one mode, but the multimodal upgrade adds the camera as another mode by which you can interact with Meta AI on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.</p><p>As an example, Meta said that you can ask your smart glasses to translate items on a menu using your voice, the camera, and Meta AI. </p>
<p>Multimodal AI isn&apos;t perfect, but it may be better than other wearable implementations of the technology, like the Humane AI Pin. Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> are paired with a smartphone, users get lower latency and quicker response times. However, the small camera and a lack of zoom can be limiting in some cases. This feature is rolling out to everyone in the U.S. and Canada but is still a beta feature. </p>

<p>Following the update, the camera on your smart glasses can also be used as a video feed for video calls. In an Instagram post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off the functionality:</p>

<p>Previously, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses could be used for livestreaming, but now video calls are supported too. </p><p>On the hardware side of things, Meta is offering two new frame options. One of them is called Skyler, and Meta describes these as having "a cat eye design inspired by an era of iconic jet-set style, designed to suit smaller faces." The other is a low-bridge option for the existing Headliner frames, which the company says is best suited for people who have glasses slide down the bridge of their nose frequently. </p>

<p>Aside from the new colorways and frames, the under-the-hood hardware is unchanged. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses still retail for $300 but have gained a few big new features since their initial launch.</p>
