                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I don&apos;t generally use external storage that much — I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">100TB home server</a> — but I&apos;ll admit that having an external SSD is the easiest way to carry plenty of data on the go. In fact, that&apos;s what I did when I traveled earlier in the month; I downloaded about 300GB of data onto an SSD, and it was significantly easier than having to transfer said data into my phone.</p><p>I have over a dozen external drives, and while I&apos;m keen on stick-based SSDs like SK Hynix&apos;s Tube T31 (which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ">is on sale</a>, by the way), Orico&apos;s latest product may just be one of the best I&apos;ve ever used. It&apos;s called the A20 Plus, and it is basically a standard external SSD with a unique difference: it has strong magnets on one side, and attaches to the back of your phone.</p><p>The addition of magnets makes it a great choice if you&apos;re looking to extend the storage of your phone. I used the external SSD with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and didn&apos;t run into any issues whatsoever. The best part is that there&apos;s a magnetic ring bundled with the package, so you can attach it to any case (or phone back) with relative ease.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using the 1TB model of the A20 Plus, and it usually costs $109 — it&apos;s now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95LJ6XB">down to $87 ahead of Black Friday</a>, and you can get an additional 15% by using the code <strong>FRZQS9NQ</strong>, bringing it down to just $73. That&apos;s a fantastic deal on what is a standout SSD, and if you need more storage, there&apos;s a 2TB model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95LL835">that&apos;s down to $135</a>. If you don&apos;t want as much storage, the base 512GB edition is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95KH1ZL">just $46 right now</a>.</p>

<p>Orico's external SSD is just as small as other external SSDs, and you get a strong magnetic connection that ensures it doesn't dangle when used with a phone. It's available in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB variants, and you can save an additional 15% when you use the code <strong>FRZQS9NQ</strong>.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95KH1ZL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="092d592e-dd25-46d8-b636-1af7462bb184" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Orico A20 Plus Magnetic SSD (512GB): $69 $46 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Orico A20 Plus Magnetic SSD (512GB): $69 $46 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The biggest differentiator with the A20 Plus is that it uses a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 connector, so it is able to deliver 20Gbps bandwidth — double that of most external SSDs. The standard isn&apos;t widely used, and there aren&apos;t many Windows machines that leverage it. That said, I was able to easily get 10Gbps bandwidth when connecting the drive to my Windows gaming rig, and it held its own against the likes of Crucial&apos;s X10 Pro.</p><p>But the key use case with this drive is to extend your phone storage, and given the bandwidth, you can easily shoot ProRes video on the iPhone 16 Pro Max at 4K60 and save footage onto the drive without any issues. I didn&apos;t see any problems connecting the drive to Android devices, and having used it with the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Find X8 Pro, it does a great job in this regard.</p><p>The A20 Plus has a plastic chassis, and it weathered tumbles without any problems. The drive is lighter than its rivals, and that makes a difference in mobile use — and the fact that you can attach it to the back of your phone makes things tidier. The bundled cable has a decent amount of flex, and it has no issues with bandwidth.</p><p>Overall, the A20 Plus is one of the best ways to extend the storage of your phone, and with the Black Friday sale now live, this is the best time to pick up the drive. If you don&apos;t need that much storage, the 500GB model is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95KH1ZL">stellar deal at just $45</a>.</p>

<p>It might seem odd to compare Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra at this point in time, considering that the former isn't even official yet. However, thanks to a steady stream of leaks and rumors, we have a fairly good idea as to what to expect from the S25 line-up. As the next standard-bearer of Samsung's slab-style flagship family, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to pack a number of noticeable design improvements over the soon-to-be previous-gen model. And, of course, you can expect the latest and greatest in terms of hardware, cameras, and software as well.</p><p>But just how significant are all these speculative upgrades? Are they really worth waiting until January 2025? Or should you simply go ahead and get the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is—and is likely to remain, at least for a few years—one of the most feature-packed Android smartphones out there? Let's find out.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Design and display</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, the design language of all three members of the Galaxy S series has remained quite consistent. Furthermore, the 'Ultra' model has always been easily distinguishable from its two younger siblings, primarily because of those right-angled corners and a slightly curved frame. However, things could finally change in 2025 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cJgunLzMZSirHU5Rxjmk7N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-03.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJgunLzMZSirHU5Rxjmk7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design" target="_blank">recently leaked renders</a> are to be believed, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will come with more rounded corners, even though they won't be nearly as rounded as the corners of the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Plus. Add a fully flat frame to the mix, and the Galaxy S25 trio could finally have a unified design language across the board. The renders also highlight changes to the rear camera array, with the individual lenses now being surrounded by thicker, ribbed rings similar to the ones on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. However, according to another leaker, the design of the primary camera setup could see some tweaks.</p>
<p>Samsung's Ultra phones have always been big (at least when compared to the other two members of the line-up) , and the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be no different. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimensions-leak" target="_blank">another rumor says</a> that the phone will be not only be slightly taller, but also a little narrower and thinner, as well as lighter in comparison to its predecessor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display is likely to remain unchanged, but considering that the 6.8-inch LTPO Dynamic AMOLED screen of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is one of the most gorgeous-looking panels on any smartphone in the market, that's not a bad thing. All other goodies such as Corning's Gorilla Armor protection and an anti-reflective coating are expected to be carried forward as well, albeit with minor improvements.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-hardware-and-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Hardware and cameras</h2>
<p>A smartphone this 'Ultra' needs equally 'Elite' innards, which is why it's all but certain that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be driven by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, Qualcomm's newest top-of-the-line chipset. The company could also use its own Exynos 2500 SoC for some regional models, as has been the case in the past. That said, there are a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-models-to-opt-for-flagship-exynos-soc-again" target="_blank">conflicting reports</a> going around regarding this, so we'll only know for sure once Samsung makes things official.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though the Exynos 2500 is likely going to be quite a capable chipset when it launches, we're not sure if it'll be any match for Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is a whole different beast altogether. Undeniably the most powerful mobile SoC ever made for Android smartphones, the platform uses a custom Oryon CPU with prime cores that can hit up to 4.32GHz of clock speeds.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip" target="_blank">According to Qualcomm</a>, this should result in a performance boost of up to 45 percent in comparison to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> platform, which powers the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It's also expected that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be offered with up to 16GB of RAM, a noteworthy upgrade over the 12GB that the previous-gen model maxes out at. Onboard storage configurations are likely to remain the same, with 1TB being the highest option.</p>
<p>While all that's great, it's worth mentioning that Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is—and will remain for quite some time—a powerhouse capable of handling everything you throw at it without breaking a sweat. The performance gains from the new hardware will primarily come in handy for things like faster on-device processing of AI-based tasks. It goes without saying that we'll only be able to comment on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's real-world performance improvements after it's launched and we put it through its paces.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra's quad-lens rear camera system makes it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> you can buy right now. You get a 200MP wide-angle sensor with OIS, a 10MP telephoto module with 3x optical zoom, a 50MP periscope telephoto unit with 5x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide lens. Of course, there's also a diverse range of shooting modes, Galaxy AI-powered editing capabilities, and whatnot thrown into a mix.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review" target="_blank">dedicated Galaxy S24 Ultra camera review</a> of the device, Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich called the setup even better than what you get with a Google Pixel, which is arguably the highest praise any Android smartphone's camera(s) can get.</p>

<p>And you know what's the best part? The rumors claim that the Galaxy S25 Ultra's primary camera system is going to be largely the same, complete with Samsung's very own ISOCELL sensors. That's quite interesting, considering that the camera arrays of the other two members of the Galaxy S25 family <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors" target="_blank">are expected</a> to come with Sony sensors.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="53xsrHgfAhYnTg8D9Lvd7d" name="one-ui-7-quick-settings-panel-sdc-2024-demo.jpg" alt="Samsung had a demo of One UI 7 on an S24 Ultra, which showed off its revamped Quick Settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/53xsrHgfAhYnTg8D9Lvd7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has been quite late to the software update party this time, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a> rollout yet to commence. This is primarily due to One UI 7—the next version of the company's custom UI overlay—which is going to be a massive overhaul packed with a plethora of cosmetic and functional changes. The wait is almost over, though, as One UI 7 will be finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year" target="_blank">making its debut alongside the Galaxy S25 trio</a> in January 2025.</p>
<p>Set to introduce a redesigned quick settings panel, updated icons, better animations, and even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>-powered features with integrated parental controls, One UI 7 will surely go a long way in making the Galaxy S25 Ultra a productivity powerhouse. However, it's pointless to get the new phone just for its software, as the Galaxy S24 Ultra will eventually get the exact same experience via a future update. And thanks to Samsung's excellent support policy, both phones will likely be getting seven years of OS and security updates, so longevity is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Coming to endurance, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to have a 5,000mAh battery with support for 45W wired, as well as 15W wireless charging. If these numbers look familiar, it's because they're exactly the same specifications that the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with.</p><p>Considering that you can get similar (or better) charging speeds even on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phones costing hundreds of dollars less</a>, that's underwhelming. However, with the Galaxy S24 Ultra already having a two-day battery life, we're certain that the Galaxy S25 Ultra—with its power-efficient hardware—won't disappoint us, even if we take the slow charging speeds into account.</p>

<p>It's true that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is shaping up to be a solid upgrade over the device it'll eventually succeed. With a refreshed and slightly more compact chassis, top-of-the-line hardware, feature-laden software, and much more, it'll undeniably end up at the top of the mountain as far as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> are concerned, just like its predecessor.</p>
<p>But here's the thing! Samsung's upcoming top-tier smartphone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour" target="_blank">likely end up being more expensive</a> than the Galaxy S24 Ultra—which already costs a fortune—but might see a reduction in its price once the newer model is launched.</p>
<p>So, if you're in the market for a premium Android smartphone and can't wait until January 2025, we suggest getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. It's a high-end device that'll continue to serve you well for years to come, even when it's no longer the newest thing in town. If you buy one during festive-season sales like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024">Black Friday</a>, you can even save a lot of cash.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you must have the freshest Android flagship and money is no object, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait">waiting for the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is absolutely going to be worth it.</p>

<p>OPPO has followed up the Pad 3 Pro with a non-Pro variant, featuring the new MediaTek Dimensity 8350 SoC with an octa-core CPU.</p><p>The tablet's Pro variant debuted earlier this month, but the standard model was delayed because the official announcement of its chipset got pushed back.</p><p>The Pad 3 is the first worldwide to feature MediaTek's new Dimensity 8350 chipset, as per OPPO's announcement on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1710173801/P1Y6Jh74e" target="_blank">Weibo</a>. It’s paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Oppo-Pad-3-launches-as-affordable-Android-tablet-with-new-Dimensity-SoC.923359.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 8350 is a powerhouse 4nm octa-core chip. It has a 3.35GHz Cortex-A715 core for heavy tasks, three more A715 cores for multitasking, and four A510 cores.</p><p>The SoC features MediaTek's StarSpeed Engine, which boosts gaming while saving power.

What's interesting about the state of the audio category is that you don't need to pay much to get great sound — that's clearly the case with Tagry's X08 earbuds.</p><p>Tagry is a brand you won't be familiar with, but the Chinese manufacturer is gaining momentum thanks to the X08, a pair of budget earbuds that have a lot going for them. They include a 13mm driver that delivers an engaging sound, and they're available in nine vibrant color options.</p><p>You get additional extras: IPX5 water resistance, great battery life, seamless pairing, and even wireless charging. The X08 earbuds usually cost $35, but they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09LD44NW6">down to $25 for Black Friday</a>, making them an instant recommendation. They're affordable enough that even if you don't need earbuds, they'll make the ideal stocking stuffer.</p>

They're easily one of the best budget earbuds around, and coming in at just $25, you're getting an unbeatable value.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09TZY6B27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4ed40126-52f4-493f-91c9-15da6def5862" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$25 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$25 at Amazon" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Let's start with the sound, because that's where the X08 truly deliver their value. While you get great sound out of most $100 earbuds, that isn't always the case in the budget segment, but the X08 manage to produce a clean and vibrant sound signature with a good bass and mid-range clarity. The treble extension is decent as well, and at no point do you get the feeling that you're listening to a budget product.</p><p>I also like that the case has a tiny LED panel that shows real-time battery status of each earbud, and it shows when the buds are charging. I got just under six hours of battery life between charges, and the case's battery charges the buds four times over. And when you need to charge the case itself, you get wireless charging, which in itself is a big deal.</p><p>The earbuds have a lightweight design, and I didn't see any issues with the fit. The stalk-like body ensures they don't nuzzle into your ear too much, and while there's no noise isolation, the earbuds create a good seal, so ambient noise doesn't filter in that much.</p><p>Connectivity was great, and I had a solid signal in the time I used the buds with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>. There's no AptX or LDAC, but that isn't as big a limitation in this category, and you get IPX5, allowing these earbuds to be used during workouts. Another highlight is that you get to choose between nine exciting colors, allowing you to customize the outward design to a greater extent than most products in this category.</p><p>Ultimately, the fact that these earbuds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09TZY6B27">cost just $25 right now</a> makes them an instant buy if you need new earbuds or are looking at budget-friendly gift ideas this holiday season.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new Google Calendar update adds a full-screen task view, making it easier to manage and prioritize tasks.</li><li>The new Tasks icon in Calendar’s top bar lets you access your task list directly and mark tasks as done.</li><li>This update is rolling out to Google Workspace users, subscribers, and personal Google account holders, but only on Android for now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-best-google-calendar-tips-hacks-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Calendar</a> update introduces a full-screen view for managing tasks, making it easier to prioritize and check off your to-dos.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/release-notes-11-22-2024.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Calendar app on Android now includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendar-tasks-full-screen-view">web version's task management features</a>, offering a full-screen view of all your tasks. This update helps you easily prioritize and track tasks, no matter when they’re due.</p><p>This means a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tasks">Google Tasks</a> icon now sits in the top bar of the Calendar app, between your profile icon and the Today button. Tapping it takes you to the standalone app’s home screen, where you can view undated tasks and lists, and mark them as done.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:470px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.66%;"><img id="bZz7emPUzhtjXB3iqbSa3V" name="Google-Calendar-full-Google-Tasks-integration" alt="full Google Tasks integration with Calendar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bZz7emPUzhtjXB3iqbSa3V.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="470" height="976" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Prior to this update, you could manage your to-dos in Tasks through Calendar, but the app had a big flaw on mobile: it didn’t let you see all your upcoming tasks in one view. Plus, it only showed tasks with due dates, leaving the rest hidden.</p><p>Now that Google Calendar has task and list views, the standalone Tasks app isn’t as needed. But it’s still handy for those who like the Tasks widget, giving quick access to lists and easy task creation right from the home screen.</p><p>While this deeper integration might add fuel to speculation that Google plans to shut down Tasks in the future, there’s no hint that it's going to be the case soon.</p><p>That said, Google isn’t exactly shy about ditching apps and products it’s lost interest in, so we can’t completely rule out that possibility.</p><p>After all, Tasks has been around for a while but still feels pretty basic. You can’t create smart lists, use tags, or add collaborators. Its only real perk is its seamless integration with Calendar, but that’s where it ends.</p><p>Google Calendar’s task integration is being made available to Google Workspace customers, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and personal Google account owners. Right now, it’s only available on Android, with no immediate plans for an iOS release.</p>

<p>Samsung needs a win with the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. The company is facing major issues and delays with its One UI 7 update, based on Android 15. It's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">apologizing for failing to innovate</a>. While we don't know exactly what the Samsung Galaxy S25 will look like, we do know a whole lot based on leaks and rumors ahead of the phone's expected mid-January launch.</p><p>With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger display, slight design tweaks, and a software overhaul, the Galaxy S25 could indeed be a massive victory. The question is, will the upgrades be tempting enough to make people still rocking a Samsung Galaxy S23 want to upgrade? That's what we'll help you start to figure out in this early comparison.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S23: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3699px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="DzgsjUdUBJbMPWDkgoyaKP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-review-rear-outdoors.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S23 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzgsjUdUBJbMPWDkgoyaKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3699" height="2081" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've been keeping a close eye on new Samsung phones recently, you probably have a good idea of where the Samsung Galaxy S25's design is headed. With the Galaxy Z Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, the company moved to a flat and more rectangular design language. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">Based on the latest renders</a>, we expect the Galaxy S25 to follow a similar pattern. It'll likely be a boxy phone with matte aluminum rails and a new lens covering around the rear camera system, closely resembling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>The exact dimensions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> are up in the air, but rumors suggest the phone could have a chassis measuring 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. That would be slightly smaller than the current Galaxy S24 and the older Galaxy S23. The phone's weight could be around the 168-gram mark. As far as durability is concerned, an IP68 water and dust-resistance rating and Gorilla Glass coverings are near locks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest change to the Galaxy S25 could be the display size. The older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-i-just-cant">Samsung Galaxy S23</a> features a 6.1-inch AMOLED display, but the Galaxy S25 could receive a bump to a 6.3-inch panel. That would follow industry trends, which are consistently shifting to favor larger displays. For example, Apple made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max</a> larger this year.</p><p>Although the Galaxy S23 will have a smaller screen, it'll likely keep up with the newer model in terms of display specs. We expect both phones to have a 120Hz AMOLED panel with variable refresh rates and high brightness capabilities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dKDSMyFkuHBoPJcHRZAFY8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-review-display-outdoors-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S23 outdoors next to a pillar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKDSMyFkuHBoPJcHRZAFY8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of colors, the latest leaks reveal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">the Galaxy S25 should come in at least four colors</a>: Moon Night Blue, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Blue, and Sparkling Green. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S23 came in many more colors: Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, Marble Grey (Samsung exclusive Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange). In all likelihood, Samsung still has a few online exclusives up its sleeve for the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S23: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>Those looking for a major camera upgrade on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series may end up once again disappointed. Top rumors indicate that the Galaxy S25 will have the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S24, which, unfortunately, would also be the same as the Galaxy S23. However, there are also leaks that predict Samsung could make a major camera hardware switch to Sony sensors, but this is something that leakers can't agree on yet.</p><p>If the Galaxy S25 indeed sticks with the same camera hardware, both phones in this comparison would feature a 50MP main shooter, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens supporting 3x optical zoom. There could be some quality improvements, even with the same hardware, based on improved image-signal processing and computational photography features.</p>

<p>The exact memory and storage configurations are unknown, as are the connectivity options. However, we're looking for the Galaxy S25 to get 5G support, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3, which would make it competitive with recent flagship releases.</p>

<p>The key things to watch on the Samsung Galaxy S25 are the phone's performance and software. It's tabbed to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, which you can think of as a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 successor. It's called 'Elite' because it now uses the same custom Oryon cores that power Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite laptop chips. In other words, the Snapdragon 8 Elite will be the most performant chip ever in a Galaxy phone.</p><p>However, we don't know what effect that will have on thermals, performance, or battery life. Some rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 will get a 5,000mAh battery to help make the phone longer-lasting. Additionally, reports indicate that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is an expensive chip, and its inclusion could drive the price upward.</p><p>On the flip side, the Galaxy S23 still sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor. It's going to be two years old when the Galaxy S25 debuts, but it's still plenty capable. It'll eventually get the jump to One UI 7 and currently supports a wide variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. Plus, there are still a few years of software upgrades left.</p><p>One UI 7 is expected to launch on the Galaxy S25, but it's a bit of a wild card. There have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">extensive delays to One UI 7's development and release</a>, partly because it's an ambitious update. If Samsung pulls it off, it'll be a key reason why the Galaxy S25 sets itself apart. However, if its struggles continue, the phone could be a buggy mess at launch.</p>

<p>As we look toward the Samsung Galaxy S25's expected mid-January launch, it's time to start thinking about whether Galaxy S23 owners should upgrade. Buying the Galaxy S25 two years after purchasing the Galaxy S23 could be a tough sell. That's especially true if the design is lackluster and the cameras are unchanged. But the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger screen, and new software features might be tempting.</p>

<p>As the person who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">reviewed the Galaxy Watch 6</a>, I was tapped to write this guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch FE vs. Watch 6</a>, which lays out in excruciating detail all of the downgrades Samsung gave the Watch FE to make it cheap: It has the same last-gen Exynos W920 as the 2021 Galaxy Watch 4, only 1.5GB of RAM, a smaller and thicker-bordered display, an older Bluetooth standard, no skin temperature sensor, and a smaller 247mAh capacity.</p><p>The jump from 1.2- to 1.3-inch display — or 1.5 if you buy the 44mm Watch 6 for $159 — 1,000 to 2,000 nits of brightness, 53mAh extra battery capacity, 1.18GHz to 1.4GHz clock speed, and 0.5GB more RAM may not sound like much on paper, but they really add up in terms of better visibility, longer stretches between charges, and shorter lag waiting for apps to open.</p><p>If the lowest price possible is your concern, then rest assured that the Galaxy Watch FE is a <em>good</em> watch; it tops our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap Android watches</a> for a reason. But what made it a good compromise was that other Galaxy Watches cost $100 more; thanks to Black Friday, that's no longer true! And its older CPU ensures it may not keep up with new Wear OS updates as ably as the Watch 6.</p>

<ul><li>The next version of Wear OS, called Wear OS 5.1, is now available for testing as a developer preview.</li><li>The Android 15-based software update can be manually tested within the Android Studio emulator in a virtual Wear OS device.</li><li>Although it's still early, new features include the ability to play audio out of smartwatch speakers and access the new Credential Manager API.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is giving us our first look at the next Wear OS update, which is based on Android 15. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5-1" target="_blank">released</a> the first developer preview of Wear OS 5.1 last week, and it's now available for testing in an Android Studio virtual device. Although it's still early, Google already revealed two key Wear OS 5.1 features: watch speaker audio playback and a credential manager.</p><p>The build number for the initial Wear OS 5.1 preview release is <strong>AP4A.241205.004.F1</strong>, and there are a few known issues. Google recommends developers start testing their Wear OS apps with the latest version to adjust to behavior changes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. Notably, some Android 15 behavior changes won't be arriving on Wear OS 5.1, like Private Spaces and predictive back animations. The known bugs are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The emulator doesn't always allow the user to add an account during the setup flow following a device reset.</li><li>When tapping on a notification, the app that sent the notification doesn't open until the user scrolls the screen.</li><li>Wear Health Services sometimes fails to start an exercise.</li></ul>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Wear OS 5.1 is the next version of Wear OS, and it's based on Android 15 just as I previously reported. https://t.co/t0pgSRpCW6 pic.twitter.com/lXLkbyxti6<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1861064684826251701">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The update currently includes two "notable features," as described by Google. The first is watch speaker playback, which will allow users to listen to audio sources through a smartwatch's inbuilt speaker. This could be a convenient way to listen to music or podcasts, albeit at low volume and subpar quality. To use your watch speaker as an audio output option, both the device's hardware and the specified app must support it in Wear OS 5.1.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="V4LxpJjZ88vsDoXPQrbNrg" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-water" alt="A close up of an info-packed watch face on the Google Pixel Watch 3, held above a pond" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4LxpJjZ88vsDoXPQrbNrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other notable feature is support for the Credential Manager API. This is already available on Android, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/upgrading-to-a-new-phone-android-can-now-keep-your-apps-signed-in-after-restoring-from-a-backup">enables features like auto-sign-in after restoring from a backup</a>. On Wear OS 5.1, the new credential manager will handle passwords, passkeys, and Sign in with Google. It'll also allow this information to be synced across Wear OS 5.1 and Android 15 devices.</p><p>Depending on the release date of Wear OS 5.1, this update could signal the platform catching up with Android. Typically, Wear OS updates have been based on preceding Android versions. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. The naming of Wear OS 5.1 could indicate that Google is trying to sync up Wear OS and Android. Or, it could simply mean that this year's Wear OS update is a minor one and not worthy of a full numbered version. After all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a> is here, so it's not that surprising that we're seeing a new version of Wear OS made available for testing as well.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung might be more than a couple of months away from launching the Galaxy A56 for the masses. However, that doesn’t stop leaks of renders showcasing the device in full.</p><p>OnLeaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-a56">Android Headlines</a> have shared the first high-quality renders of the Galaxy A56, the company’s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range smartphones</a> for 2025. It should be launched sometime in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad!

<p>The shared CAD-based renders again reveal a familiar design as its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A55</a>, featuring flat edges and rounded corners. It will have a flat punch-hole display and three rear cameras stacked vertically on the back. A slight difference; however, is that the A55’s rear cameras were placed individually, whereas the placement on the Galaxy A56 appears to be stacked in a single camera module.</p><p>The publication also implies Samsung should be borrowing the “Key Island” design elements introduced in Galaxy A55 alongside the budget Galaxy A15 and Galaxy 25 phones from last year, where the power button and volume rockers are a bit raised on the right pane of the device to spot them easily.</p>

<p>While the expected specifications are still unclear, Android Headlines highlights that the device might feature 45W fast charging similar to the flagship Galaxy phones despite the Galaxy A56 being a mid-range phone. According to a recent Chinese certification, the device is also expected to be powered by the Exynos 1580 SoC, which was announced in October.</p><p>If the launch of the predecessor models is any indication, the Galaxy A56 should be released in March 2025 in markets starting with Europe and likely priced under €500.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Samsung’s other Galaxy A series device, dubbed Galaxy A26, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a26-renders-surface-online-revealing-its-design">spotted in the renders</a>—also shared by OnLeaks last week—giving us a good look at the design and some of the expected specifications of the sub-$300 Galaxy phone.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jeremy asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I just noticed that Google seems to have duplicate copies of my whole photo library, which, I'm guessing, is a waste of space.  There's a whole directory in My Drive that seems to be a duplicate of old family photos I scanned years ago, sorted by year and, I guess, not really needed.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>What's going on here? Does this count against my Google storage limit? Most importantly, can I delete all this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Jeremy! You've stumbled across a secret Google feature that gives you a look at what sets Google apart when it comes to online services: the unintended, multilayered problem.</p><p>On a serious note, this happens (or <em>happened</em>, as we'll see later) to some folks who used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-photos">Google Photos</a> in its early days but didn't affect others. The short answer to your questions: you're seeing duplicates because Google Photos stores its files in a hidden folder in your shared Google storage. Yes, it counts against your storage the same way any files you purposefully uploaded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>, and you can delete the folder(s) from Google Drive after you verify you have copies in the Google Photos app. For a discussion of the mess, read on!</p>
<p>Not everyone sees these old duplicate files. At some point, Google changed how Photos stores its data, but it still is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos-uploads-will-soon-count-towards-your-google-drive-storage">part of your overall storage space provided by Google</a>. Before this, you could see your Google Photos storage in Drive if you knew where and how to look for it, but it was intended to be hidden.</p><p>During the transition, some people had folders duplicated while the way they were stored changed. I've heard this has to do with specific metadata, how the files were added to Photos, or what device was used to upload them. These theories could be correct, or they could be 100% wrong; regardless, it happened, and when it happened, the folders became visible like any other folder in Drive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kyyZs7NSMFx6cQgMZZ3abg" name="google-photos-lifestyle-widescreen-crop.jpg" alt="Google Photos on a Pixel 4a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyyZs7NSMFx6cQgMZZ3abg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These folders are no longer associated with Google Photos and that means they are duplicated elsewhere in a way you can't (easily) find them. It also means they are taking up space.</p><p>You have a limited amount of space associated with your Google account. You <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">can pay to have more if you need it</a>, or you can manage your stored and saved files so you don't reach the limit.</p><p>These duplicate folders can be safely deleted once you've double-checked to make sure the photos are also stored in the Google Photos app. <strong>Do not delete them until you have checked. </strong>Never trust anything without verifying it for yourself.</p>
<p>One thing you might want to look at before you delete anything is the quality of the photo being stored, <em>especially</em> if you used to have an original<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare"> Pixel</a> or a Pixel 2.</p><p>It used to be that if you had a Pixel phone, your photos were stored at full quality without any cost to your shared storage allotment. Other photos had their quality reduced; it was still high-quality and is likely good enough for anything other than trying to have physical prints made, but there is a difference.</p><p>There is a chance that these "duplicate" photos would be full quality and the photos in Google Photos are not. This situation happened to me when I got hit with the weird duplication bug/mess/Googleism. A bunch of photos I took with the first Pixel phone were stored in full resolution and quality in my Google Drive but the "copies" in Google Photos were not.</p><p>It's up to you to decide if you want or need these larger-sized files (I didn't), but if you don't know and don't check, you can't decide.</p>
<p>One last thing to note — this happened to a <em>lot</em> of people, and it's probably worth checking if you are one of them and don't know it. Just open your Google Drive and look through all the stuff that's stored there. If you see folders full of pictures, this is probably why.</p>
