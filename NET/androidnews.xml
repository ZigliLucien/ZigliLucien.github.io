<p>To call rucking the hottest fitness trend of 2024 feels like an understatement. I&apos;ve seen rucking write-ups across mainstream and tech blogs, all proclaiming how walking with a military backpack has massively improved their fitness within weeks (or even days) and that you "need" to try it yourself.</p><p>Seeing this unrestrained rucking enthusiasm from other sites refocused my angle for this column. Unfortunately, I need to temper people&apos;s expectations a bit.</p><p>The concept of rucking is simple: Walking has cardiovascular benefits, but if you put on a heavy rucksack, your heart will hit higher, fat-burning zones, your upper and lower body muscles will develop, and even your bone density will improve without taking that much extra time or being as high-impact as running.</p><p>I&apos;ve rucked occasionally for the past two months, and I&apos;d wholeheartedly recommend <em>some</em> people try it. Rucking makes me nostalgic for my Boy Scout days doing 50-mile hikes in the Sierra Nevadas — except I get to drive home and eat proper food afterward.</p><p>That said, too much rucking coverage exaggerates its positives and ignores its downsides. Not everyone needs to imitate military recruits to get healthier. So, let&apos;s dive into why I like rucking, and I want to make sure new converts to the cult of rucking don&apos;t have regrets later.</p>
<h2 id="light-rucking-is-the-perfect-challenge-for-hikers-and-runners-2">Light rucking is the perfect challenge for hikers and runners</h2>
<p>The big hurdle for rucking is the upfront cost. Unlike my fellow journalists who probably got gifted or expensed Goruck packs, I had to decide whether to spend $300–400 on a proper rucksack with fancy support straps and designed pouches for weight plates, as r/Rucking users recommend, or use a "normal" backpack and risk straining my lower back.</p><p>Instead, I repurposed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rei.com/product/176899/rei-co-op-ruckpack-18-recycled-daypack">18L REI daypack</a> I&apos;d bought to carry water and trail mix. It&apos;s not rugged enough for true support or a ton of weight, but I could fit two 10-pound plates and a rolled-up towel behind them in the laptop sleeve so that the weight stayed close to my back and didn&apos;t bounce around as I trekked up and down steep hills. </p>

<p>As a runner who&apos;s never been into strength training, I don&apos;t have much defined muscle, so entry-level rucking is perfect cross-training for me. It tricks me into enjoying a total-body workout by distracting me with nature and cardio, it gives my feet a break from runs, and it helps me get low-aerobic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> — aka prolonged time in heart rate zones 1 and 2 — for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">building up my VO2 Max</a> foundation so I can push harder on my regular runs.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goruck.com/blogs/news-stories/the-beginners-guide-to-rucking">Goruck beginner&apos;s guide</a> recommends working your way up to 1/3 of your body weight, starting at 20 pounds and adding five extra pounds per week for short walks until you reach this goal. I&apos;d recommend starting even lighter (maybe 10 pounds?), then stopping at around 20 pounds until you&apos;ve rucked enough to justify shelling out for proper gear.</p>
<h2 id="don-apos-t-ruck-before-you-can-walk-2">Don&apos;t ruck before you can walk</h2>
<p>Without calling out any specific writers or sites, I&apos;ve seen tons of headlines about rucking for "10,000 steps a day," or rucking every day for weeks, and having immediate benefits to strength, endurance, and mental health.</p><p>Look, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">I walked 10,000 steps a day for a month</a> last year before I&apos;d even heard of rucking. I lost weight, built up a higher VO2 Max for endurance, and felt much happier — though the walks did get boring after a while. Sound familiar, minus the strength training?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-on-shoes.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965, which is sitting on top of a pair of shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching from a sedentary writer&apos;s lifestyle to an active one feels great, whether or not you&apos;re wearing a backpack. Rucking will make you stronger, but you probably shouldn&apos;t do it daily unless you&apos;re already in shape and have decent core strength — and don&apos;t feel awkward wearing a military pack in the suburbs or on city streets.</p><p>Otherwise, most people should take care not to have false expectations, or to hurt themselves by overtraining. Rucking once or twice a week is more realistic to start, and if you&apos;re using heavier weights, you probably should only be walking 2,000 to 5,000 steps at first, not 10,000. You&apos;ll want to walk longer and rucksack-free on other days to sustain losing weight.</p>
<h2 id="rucking-isn-apos-t-some-miracle-workout-2">Rucking isn&apos;t some miracle workout</h2>
<p>If you search "rucking calories," you&apos;ll see Gemini and marketing sites claiming that rucking burns 2.5–3x the calories you burn while walking, saving you time. Nope. I have no idea where they came up with that multiplier.</p><p>I hiked the same 10-mile hike with 2,250 feet of elevation gain, once with no pack and once with 25 pounds of pack weight. My first hike burned 1,081 calories (according to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>) with a 120 bpm HR average, 161 bpm max, and 2:38:06 total hike time; my second hike burned 1,541 calories with a 131 bpm HR average, 183 bpm max, and 2:57:10 hike time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yzytha8UrUsXciHnVifR4g" name="rucking-hike-calorie-comparison.jpg" alt="Two Garmin Connect app screenshots showing two near-identical hikes by the author, comparing their burned calories when hiking with or without a rucksack" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzytha8UrUsXciHnVifR4g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The left workout was weight-free; the gap might have been even closer, but I skipped a short out-and-back on that hike. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why did I burn more calories? Carrying more weight required slightly more cardiovascular effort on flat ground, steep hills strained my heart more than they normally would, and the same distance took slightly longer to finish. Still, I only burned 42.5% more calories, not 200% more.</p><p>No doubt I&apos;d burn even more calories with more weight, right? But only because it would stretch the hike longer; unless you&apos;re climbing tons of hills, the gap won&apos;t be that great, and more weight will just injure you. When I checked this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-fitness-requirements/rucking-calories-burned">article from a Navy Seal about rucking</a>, he had a similar, reasonable estimate to my findings: a "40%-50%" caloric boost from a 50-pound pack for military folk better trained for extra weight.</p><p>So if you&apos;re only walking or rucking for 30 minutes, you might jump from 200 to 340 calories — not insignificant, but not a paradigm shift either.</p>
<h2 id="rucking-is-only-apos-safe-apos-if-you-apos-re-careful-and-patient-2">Rucking is only &apos;safe&apos; if you&apos;re careful and patient</h2>
<p>There&apos;s this common idea that rucking is "safe" while running will destroy your joints and lead to injury. I can&apos;t deny that running can cause short- and long-term issues if you&apos;re not careful. But wearing an extra 30–50 pounds of weight for daily walks would put as much strain and compression on your unprepared joints and soft tissue over time, even if it&apos;s "low-impact."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32191155/#:~:text=Results%20indicated%20significant%20increases%20in,load%20carriage;%20peak%20impact%20force.">NIH</a> found that ROTC cadets were at higher risk of bone stress injuries after a four-mile ruck "despite the cadets not feeling fatigued." Without proper core strength, the compressive strain on your spine from heavy weight can lead to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cospineandjoint.com/rucking-compressive-load-lumbar-spine/">long-term disc, muscular, and spinal issues</a>, even with a supportive rucksack. And get ready for blisters, plantar fasciitis, and knee pain if you overdo it.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying this <em>will</em> happen, especially if you build up your strength safely over time with a lighter pack. But if you&apos;re not in the best shape and using rucking as a cure-all to shave off weight, you&apos;re going to have problems. A simple test is to see whether you can do simple body-weight exercises like squats or lunges, with or without a rucksack, to see if your body is ready for even more strain.</p><p>If it isn&apos;t, try walking for a month first; you might be surprised at how many calories you burn from simple body weight. Then maybe you&apos;ll be ready to ruck.</p>
<h2 id="my-advice-before-you-ruck-2">My advice before you ruck</h2>
<p>I apologize for being a Debbie Downer in this column. I really do enjoy rucking when I find the time, and I&apos;m hoping that if I develop more core strength, I&apos;ll be able to justify buying a more official and supportive rucking pack and boost my weight load. </p><p>But I&apos;d make that purchase knowing that rucking is a sideshow for me. It&apos;s an exciting challenge that gives <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">long hikes</a> more of an impact, but I can&apos;t hike more than once or twice a month without neglecting other parts of my life. And with or without a rucksack, walking just isn&apos;t as <em>fun</em> as running for me. Yes, I&apos;m weird.</p><p>If you want to dive into rucking, here is my advice:</p>
<ul><li>Start with whatever backpack you have now, and use heavy objects like water bottles if you don't have gym plates; <strong>then</strong> buy the proper rucking pack.</li><li>See if you have the inclination and patience to enjoy long walks, with or without a rucking pack. I recommend audiobooks or podcasts.</li><li>Wear a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> to track your body's progress in adapting to heavier weights.</li><li>Don't irresponsibly weigh down your rucksack more than you can handle in the vain hope of seeing tripled caloric burn. </li></ul>
<p>Just...hike! Give yourself the challenge of rucking — and all the associated costs — once you&apos;ve graduated from the basics. Otherwise, that rucksack will just take up closet space and you&apos;ll be looking for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">weight-loss</a> or workout fad.</p>

<p>Meta used the same Fresnel lenses, so your Quest 2 Zenni Optical lenses (or 3D-printed glasses inserts) will slot perfectly on the Quest 3S. </p>
<p>Both headsets use the same USB-C port, so any compatible <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-link-cable-alternative-oculus-quest-2">Link cable</a> should work. </p>
<p>The Quest 3S is narrower and its Touch Plus controllers are smaller than the Quest 2 and its controllers; they'll fit in your current case, but you may want to add a lens blocker or inner padding in case the controllers bounce around.</p>
<p>Quest 2 replacement Elite Straps, facial interfaces, silicone covers, controller grips, and headphones with 3.5mm jacks won't transfer over the Quest 3S. </p></article></section>

<p>When it comes to Meta Quest 3S accessories, Quest 2 owners will have to find replacements for popular favorites like Elite Straps and facial interfaces; even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> and 3S <em>look</em> similar, the newer headset is actually closer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> in some ways.</p><p>Quest 3 Elite Straps, Elite Straps with Battery, Active Straps for Touch Plus controllers, and Carrying Cases will work with the Quest 3S, too.</p><p>Quest 3 owners don&apos;t have much reason to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">downgrade to a Quest 3S</a>, but a benefit to this interchangeability is that most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best 3rd-party Quest 3 accessories</a> will work for the Quest 3S, too. You have a year&apos;s worth of tech to choose from.</p><p>Not every Quest 3 accessory works for the Quest 3S, so be careful.

<h2 id="quest-2-owners-will-need-to-stock-up-on-new-quest-3s-accessories-2">Quest 2 owners will need to stock up on new Quest 3S accessories</h2>
<p>We expect most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> buyers will be Quest 2 owners who skipped the Quest 3, waiting for something more affordable. If you&apos;re still deciding whether to upgrade, we have a guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-2">Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 2</a> that runs through each key difference, but the 3S improves on power and mixed reality while bringing back some of the same problems.</p><p>If you didn&apos;t like the Quest 2 cloth strap, you won&apos;t feel much different about the 3S strap; you&apos;ll also need a battery pack, as the Quest 3S reportedly hits that same 2.5-hour max as the Quest 2 did.</p><p>The Quest 3S thankfully uses silicone instead of foam, but you&apos;ll want the Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface (or a 3rd-party equivalent) for better comfort and venting. And while the new Touch Plus controllers lose the tracking ring, they&apos;re still about the same weight and many active gamers will need new knuckle grips.</p><p>Another difference is that the Quest 3S doesn&apos;t have a 3.5mm headphone jack, and some wireless USB-C earbuds that worked with the Quest 2 like the Soundcore VR P10s don&apos;t work fully with the Quest 3 because of charging differences.</p>

<p>Aside from our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S hands-on</a> at Meta Connect, we&apos;ve yet to officially test Quest 3S accessories aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-3s-breathable-facial-interface/" target="_blank"><strong>Breathable Facial Interface</strong></a>, which adds a mesh between the silicone face pad and headset for better venting, as well as opens your peripheral vision to make mixed-reality gaming feel more natural. We liked it in our initial testing.</p><p>Otherwise, we can comfortably recommend Quest 3 accessories we&apos;ve tested thoroughly in the year since the Quest 3 launched, as day-one Quest 3S purchases for you.</p><p>You can buy the official Quest 3 Elite Strap, but we&apos;re fans of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR"><strong>BoboVR M3 Pro strap</strong></a>. It comfortably balances the headset weight, lets you adjust the lens angle for the best view, and it has swappable, magnetic battery packs. With just the one included battery you add another two hours of playtime, but Quest power users can buy a backup battery and swap it in while charging the dead one, keeping the fun going.</p>

<p>We also love these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJRK7B8J"><strong>AMVR controller grips</strong></a>, which work perfectly since the Quest 3S and 3 controllers are identical, and cost less than half of Meta&apos;s official grips.

The earbuds themselves have minimal latency and give you the best sound you&apos;d expect without proper over-ear headphones.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S, like the Quest 2, needs accessories for the best experience, but it's still an upgrade over its predecessor. Its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip enables exclusive games and enhancements, the full color cameras allow for some incredible mixed-reality experiences, its controllers have better haptics, and it's a bit less front-heavy.</p></p>

Many Meta Quest 3 head straps also work on the Meta Quest 3S.</p></article></section>
<hr>
<h2 id="here-apos-s-why-you-might-want-to-replace-the-meta-quest-3s-head-strap-2">Here&apos;s why you might want to replace the Meta Quest 3S head strap</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a> ships with a simple cloth Head strap that adjusts via a loop-and-band system. While the cloth strap makes it easy to put the headset on and take it off quickly, the design has several downsides.</p><p>Some people find it uncomfortable for several reasons. Depending on your head shape, the strap can pinch ears or put an uncomfortable amount of weight on them. The strap also doesn&apos;t do much to balance the weight, leaving your face to accept most of the pressure. Because it&apos;s cloth, it&apos;ll also absorb any sweat generated from playing in VR, which means it&apos;s less than sanitary to pass around to friends and family if you&apos;ve been playing seriously sweaty apps or games.</p><p>Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 head straps</a> all work with the Meta Quest 3S. Several companies are also developing a separate line of Quest 3S head straps that don&apos;t have the 3.5mm headphone jack slot on the right side since the Quest 3S lacks this port. Even if you use a head strap designed for the Meta Quest 3 with a slot for the 3.5mm port, it&apos;ll still fit the Meta Quest 3S because both headsets use an identical side rail design.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for some suggestions, I&apos;d recommend picking up two different brand&apos;s head straps for your Meta Quest 3S. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bobovr-m3-pro-review-meta-quest-3-headstrap">BoboVR M3 Pro</a> is my personal favorite head strap as it uses a halo-style design which means the head strap makes a ring shape that rests on your forehead and the back of your cranium.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fjUWcWPipmLc2uuMNoahYH" name="meta-quest-3-bobovr-m3-pro-headstrap-oct-2024.jpg" alt="A Meta Quest 3 outfitted with a BoboVR M3 Pro head strap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fjUWcWPipmLc2uuMNoahYH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">This is a BoboVR M3 Pro head strap on a Meta Quest 3, but it will work identically on a Meta Quest 3S. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This alleviates most of the weight from the face, although there&apos;s still a nice tight seal around the facial interface to keep light out. This head strap also comes with rechargeable, magnetically detachable batteries that drop on the back for extra weight balance and hours of additional play time for your headset.</p><p>If you&apos;re not a fan of halo-style designs, Kiwi Design&apos;s head straps use premium batteries and an elite strap-style design that cradles the back of your head and distributes the weight along the top. My son prefers this style of head strap and finds it most comfortable. Plus, Kiwi Design&apos;s batteries are among the safest in the industry and provide double the battery time of a single normal capacity BoboVR battery.</p><p>No matter which you choose, most Meta Quest 3S alternative head straps will give you a better fit and provide better hygiene than the stock Quest 3S cloth strap. Both head straps I recommended not only come with batteries that prolong your Quest 3S&apos;s battery life but are also far easier to clean so you can feel comfortable passing around the headset to friends and family this Holiday season.</p>

<p>To hit the same $299 price point as in 2020, Meta made its sort-of next-gen Quest 3S headset emulate the Quest 2's quirks, ignoring some of the pricier Quest 3 upgrades like pancake lenses. Despite looking and feeling like a Quest 2, the Quest 3S has some subtle (and not-so-subtle) perks for long-time VR fans.</p></p>

<p>Even though Meta doesn't sell the Quest 2 anymore, most VR developers still code their games for the Quest 2 first — targeting its millions of users — before upscaling them to the Quest 3S and 3. Since the Quest 3S uses the Quest 2 as its template, you won't find changes to the resolution, lenses, and core design.</p></p>

<p>We&apos;re comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 2 for anyone with the 2020 headset considering an upgrade. Despite the higher number, the Quest 3S will feel virtually identical to Quest 2 owners when they first try it on. Its upgrades have more to do with hardware than design, but they&apos;re still significant.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> sold over 20 million units because of its affordability and wire-free design; that holds true with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3S</a>, which costs the same ($299), weighs about the same, still lacks any tethers, and brings back the same gaming library — now with enhanced graphics.</p><p>Based on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S hands-on</a>, we have a real sense of what Quest 2 owners should expect from the new headset. Let&apos;s break down all of the key similarities and differences.</p>

<h2 id="meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-2-what-apos-s-the-same-2">Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 2: What&apos;s the same?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1688px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="oBQpBiP2rphESrJYzgJEEa" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-12.jpeg" alt="A man puts on a Meta Quest 3S VR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oBQpBiP2rphESrJYzgJEEa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1688" height="950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In order to keep the Quest 3S at an affordable price, Meta held back some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> upgrades over the Quest 2. Because of that, the Quest 3S and Quest 2 share many traits:</p><p><strong>Fresnel lenses:</strong> While the Quest 3 upgraded to pancake lenses that make the headset 30% slimmer, the Quest 3S uses the same Fresnel lens, which requires more empty space between lens and display. It also creates a noticeable "sweet spot" when using either headset; you&apos;re more likely to turn your head to look around a VR world because the periphery appears blurrier than it does with pancake lenses.</p><p><strong>IPD lens adjustment: </strong>You can adjust the lenses to any of three interpupillary distances (IPD): 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm. We have a guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-adjust-eye-distance-ipd-oculus-quest-2">how to measure your IPD</a>, which also mentions that you can slide the lenses between these settings — around 60.5mm or 65.5mm — if your IPD doesn&apos;t perfectly match these presets. </p><p><strong>LCD resolution: </strong>Meta uses the same LCD in the Quest 2 and Quest 3S, both sharing 1,832 x 1,920 pixels per eye, which equals 773 pixels per inch or about 20 pixels per degree. If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Quest 3 vs. Quest 2</a> for visuals, the newer headset hits 2,064 x 2,208, or about 25 PPD, giving a significant boost.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jE29SYg6eC73rZzD6UqspX" name="oculus-quest-2-link-on-pc-01.jpg" alt="A Meta Quest 2 headset with controllers on top of a gaming PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jE29SYg6eC73rZzD6UqspX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Field of view:</strong> Both the Quest 3S and Quest 2 have a 96º horizontal view and 90º vertical view; they fall short of the Quest 3 (110º horizontal; 96º vertical).</p><p><strong>Wireless, modular design:</strong> This is stating the obvious, but it&apos;s fair to point out that both the Quest 3S and Quest 2 work entirely on battery power, unlike most other VR headsets like the Valve Index, PSVR 2, or Apple Vision Pro. Also, Meta designs the Quest so that you can detach the strap or facial interface without needing to unscrew anything or void your warranty. This allows you to install a better accessory with very little difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-2-design-differences-2">Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 2: Design differences</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1545px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="snZ3fLKwjauXok7d3vfEuX" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-10.jpeg" alt="The Meta Quest 3S sitting on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/snZ3fLKwjauXok7d3vfEuX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1545" height="869" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though both headsets use Fresnel lenses, Meta found a way to make the Quest 3S 20% slimmer than the Quest 2, or about 19mm / 0.75in. thinner. Meta also made the Quest 3S look flatter, with a harder line along the front edge where the Quest 2 is more curved.</p><p>In terms of weight, the Quest 2 weighs 11 grams less, or about 0.4 ounces. You&apos;re not going to notice the difference; either way, you&apos;re going to want an Elite Strap to balance the weight better.</p><p>The most obvious design difference is the camera array; we&apos;ll talk about mixed reality next, but strictly from an aesthetic perspective, the Quest 3S puts its cameras front and center in a fun triangular pattern, whereas the Quest 2 camera sensors are smaller, isolated recesses.</p><p>Frustratingly, Meta chose to drop the 3.5mm headphone jack from the Quest 2 and 3 in the 3S; your only options are to use the built-in speakers or wireless earbuds with a USB-C receiver that allows for charging passthrough in case you have a battery pack. And on that note, the Quest 3S has its USB-C charging port in the right arm, whereas the Quest 2 port is directly on the headset body.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pSgphbdWjXUAX5qo2QTrFn" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-side-with-breathable-facial-interface-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S, looking at the hardware from all sides" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pSgphbdWjXUAX5qo2QTrFn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both headsets have a default cloth strap, and our Quest 3S tester said that it "felt identical" to the Quest 2 in terms of comfort and support. That said, there is one difference: the Quest 2 strap had a single broad top strap with velcro, while the Quest 3S top strap branches off in a Y shape to cup both sides of your head, theoretically preventing it from sliding to one side as easily.</p><p>Either headset nets you about 2.5 hours of battery life in ideal conditions (according to Meta), but we expect your Quest 2 capacity has dipped naturally over the last four years. The older headset has 684mAh less capacity, but the Quest 3S uses more battery life because of things like the new cameras, LEDs, and extra RAM. Regardless, anyone who bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-battery-pack">Quest 2 battery pack</a> will probably want one for the Quest 3S.</p><p>As for controller design, the Quest 3S uses the same next-gen Touch Plus controllers as the Quest 3. They&apos;re not that different from the Quest 2 in terms of tracking accuracy, but they no longer need the giant tracking rings and they have improved TruTouch Haptics for games.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GbBYne4giGcYzWHJgX4c4G" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-wearing-02.jpg" alt="Wearing the Meta Quest 3S at a hands-on event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GbBYne4giGcYzWHJgX4c4G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest Meta Quest 3S upgrade is in performance. It uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2, while the Quest 2 uses the XR2 Gen 1. It also has 8GB of RAM instead of 6GB. </p><p>Practically speaking, the Quest 2 and Quest 3S share most of the same hundreds of Quest games. However, on the Quest 3S, many of your old Quest 2 titles get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-exclusives-and-enhanced-games">graphical enhancements</a>; developers can patch games to add 4K textures, higher refresh rates, dynamic lighting and shadows, and reduced fog, as well as other changes at the developer&apos;s discretion.</p><p>Not all Quest 2 games get Quest 3 and 3S patches — we know of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wAOsGIT1pZZssiyt-TjI-pAwCsEWCo3kCmqV7fmnG0s/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">about 100 games</a> with them — but even without a specific patch, you&apos;ll see reduced loading times for games and apps.</p><p>Also, there are some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a> that are exclusive to the Quest 3S & 3 because the Quest 2&apos;s CPU can&apos;t handle them. AAA titles like Alien: Rogue Incursion and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> will give Quest 2 owners FOMO unless they upgrade, and we could see more Quest 3 exclusives as the Quest 2&apos;s chip becomes increasingly obsolete and more users swap to newer headsets.</p><p>More commonly, you&apos;ll see Quest 3 games that don&apos;t work on Quest 2 because they require full color mixed reality, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/laser-dance/7209598115800315/" target="_blank">Laser Dance</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/hello-dot/25825290007070369/" target="_blank">Hello Dot</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/living-room/7778145568911617/" target="_blank">Living Room</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/starship-home/5959677854068956/" target="_blank">Starship Home</a>. This also applies to software features like Meta AI with Vision, since it requires high-res passthrough.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ju9Btm2Rrb6HKwehjnqSem" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-front-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S, looking at the hardware from all sides" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ju9Btm2Rrb6HKwehjnqSem.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that topic, the Quest 2 and Quest 3S share the same number of standard VGA sensors for inside-out tracking, but when it comes to passthrough the Quest 2 uses a black-and-white camera with less than 1MP resolution, showing just 4 PPD in ugly, blurry gray when you&apos;re checking out your surroundings.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S received the same 4MP cameras as the Quest 3, delivering 18 pixels per degree in full color. While mixed reality mode had some issues in the year since the Quest 3 launched, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">v64 update</a> improved color and resolution and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/an-update-just-fixed-the-biggest-quest-3-mixed-reality-problem">v66 update</a> removed warping around hands and objects. The Quest 3S benefits from all these tweaks straight out of the gate, so you don&apos;t need to take off the headset as often as the Quest 2 to check in with family or walk around the house.</p><p>Meta says that these dual 4MP cameras enable depth tracking via software. The Quest 3 has an actual hardware depth sensor, but the Quest 2 wasn&apos;t designed to track depth the same way, so this should theoretically make the Quest 3S better for hand tracking — though we suggest waiting for our full review for confirmation.</p><p>Another interesting Quest 3S addition is two flood LEDs "for illumination and more reliable hand interactions across environments and lighting conditions." In theory, this would let you play games in dimly-lit rooms with no fear that the headset will fail to track your actions; we couldn&apos;t test this in the normally-lit Meta demo space, so you&apos;ll have to wait for our review to see how well this works.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S is objectively better than the Quest 2; the only question is whether the upgrades are enough for you to spend another $299 (or $399 for doubled storage).</p><p>Meta doesn&apos;t sell the Quest 2 anymore; you may be able to find one used for cheap, but the lack of mixed-reality hardware is a major negative in our books. It makes using a Quest 3S headset much less isolating, so you&apos;re not constantly taking it on and off if you&apos;re a parent or pet owner having to put out fires.</p><p>While the Quest 2 still has new games coming in every day, their versions look dated, run at a lower refresh rate, and take longer to load. The Quest 3S still has the same resolution and lenses, true, but even if you&apos;re only seeing a sweet spot, it&apos;ll still look and run better than before.</p><p>If you&apos;re uncertain whether the Quest 3S does enough for you as a Quest 2 owner, you may want to read our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Quest 3S vs. Quest 3</a> guide instead and choose whether it&apos;s worth the extra cost for a higher-res, crisper, and wider view.</p>

<p>You can buy a used Quest 2 if it's especially cheap, but it makes sense to choose the Quest 3S if you want it to last longer. Still, it was a popular VR headset for a reason, which is why the Quest 3S largely kept its design. The main reason to choose the Quest 3S instead is full color mixed reality.</p></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Bose has rightfully earned its reputation for not only delivering great sound, but also innovating to drown out the background. Its headphones don&apos;t come out with the same cadence other brands do, and that&apos;s definitely not a bad thing. Quality should last, after all.</p><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are a prime example, given they&apos;ve been out on the market for a while and still stand out among the best. There are various reasons why and they largely begin with the outstanding noise-cancelation.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-price-and-availability"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones: Price and availability</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6tiPtxrPGBuEREyXyVytrL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-case.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones folded in their case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tiPtxrPGBuEREyXyVytrL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bose <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-earbuds-launch">launched</a> the QuietComfort Ultra headphones in September 2023, and are still widely available in retail and online stores. Since Bose doesn&apos;t release updated models every year, these headphones should be around for a long while. They start out at $429, and though you might come across a price cut along the way, they don&apos;t generally happen all that often.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-what-s-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones: What's good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjdriWGkig6DFdbJFyAgXL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-wearing-side.jpg" alt="Side view of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones being worn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjdriWGkig6DFdbJFyAgXL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra ultimately replace the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, and in so doing, lead to a more comfortable fit under the same weight. The faux leather cushions are soft, yet firm enough to cover your ears and maintain a nice seal. Wearing these for long-haul flights, like I did during testing, is a pleasure for how good they feel and how well they perform.</p><p>Certainly doesn&apos;t hurt they fold flat and inward to lower their footprint for the included case. Bose also gives the case a vegan leather veneer on the outside, with a pouch on the inner lining to stash the included USB-C and 3.5mm-to-2.5mm cables.</p><p>Wired playback is part of the allure here, except it has to be through a headphone jack or adapter; no USB-C audio playback here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fhxhA8X6gWwq6kZTjXZqgM" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-earcups.jpg" alt="Exposed ear cups on Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhxhA8X6gWwq6kZTjXZqgM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What sets these headphones apart from Bose&apos;s other pairs is that the "Ultra" in the name also refers to new features. Among the biggest is Immersive Audio, which is essentially spatial audio under a different term. It works with any audio content you listen to, but works best when you&apos;re playing something tuned for the spatial surround effect, like a Dolby Atmos song or show.</p><p>You don&apos;t necessarily need it to appreciate the audio quality in the QC Ultra. Vibrant and with plenty of verve, no matter what you listen to, they hold up well against the best premium options available. Bose wisely includes support for Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon Sound and the aptX Lossless Bluetooth codec, ensuring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vanilla.tools/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res tracks</a> play without issue. If you&apos;re using an Android phone or tablet with a Snapdragon 888 processor or better, then you can theoretically listen to bitrates equal to CD quality.</p><p>Regardless of taste, these headphones draw you in. New drivers certainly contribute to that, helping deliver both obvious refinement in how they sound and subtleties in instruments, vocals, and harmonies that resonate just the same. I would say you get more bass response out of the box here than you would with the Sony WH-1000XM5.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="TndY7zybJ7exRQEwDCyzDL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Screenshots showing features with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TndY7zybJ7exRQEwDCyzDL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can always try tuning the sound to your liking using the equalizer in the Bose Music app, though you can&apos;t save presets. Bose only gives you four of its own, limiting the creativity you can come up with by otherwise tinkering with the three bands. The good news is Bose did a fine job tuning them by default so you get a nice balance to start with.</p><p>Immersive Audio is an interesting one in that it&apos;s a debut for Bose&apos;s over-ear headphones, while catching up with what competitors are already doing. Results are mixed, with the effect really coming alive in some respects, and less so in others. I find the best outcomes almost always stem from content designed for spatial audio, which is why I could feel the effect a little more playing tracks on Tidal and Amazon Music over Spotify, for instance.</p><p>Head tracking works as advertised, keeping the audio in front of you at all times. It&apos;s probably one of the more subjective features of an otherwise subjective experience. I can see some liking it and others feeling underwhelmed, so it will depend on what your ears tell you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h25MmN6zznTZQUPjSqkawM" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-wearing-front.jpg" alt="Front view of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones being worn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h25MmN6zznTZQUPjSqkawM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The showstopper is the active noise-cancelation (ANC), which is world-class on the QC Ultra. Wearing these for a long flight had me watching movies with the plane&apos;s engine noise barely registering. I even had to remove them to simply hear announcements or switch to Aware mode quickly when speaking with a flight attendant. On a subway train, screeching tracks inevitably cut through, but only as whimpers that don&apos;t detract from the content.</p><p>Without question, these are one of the best pairs of headphones I&apos;ve worn to cancel out background noise. The beauty of it is Bose retains the ability to customize the experience by way of its CustomTune technology that manifests in the Modes section of the Bose Music app. There are about a dozen to choose from, including Commute, Outdoor, Run, Work, and Focus.</p><p>You can&apos;t fully adjust these however you please, as they&apos;re more about combining certain features together. For instance, you can toggle Wind Block on and either turn Immersive Audio on or off. Wind Block ramps up noise-cancelation to the max, so once you toggle that on, you lose any granular control over ANC potency.</p><p>Aware mode is good at funneling in a variety of ambient sounds but voices could be clearer. It&apos;s the one weakness that holds it back, forcing me to not always trust I could be sure of what someone is saying unless they were in really close proximity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="PHgYHopwsy6poaKuL3yT6L" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Screenshots showing features with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PHgYHopwsy6poaKuL3yT6L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The QC Ultra have multipoint to stay connected to two devices simultaneously. There&apos;s even a shortcut you can set up to switch between them using the Bluetooth button on the right cup. The dual connection matters for phone calls, of which you can expect clear calls, though I do feel voices could be clearer on both sides for headphones in this range. With five microphones on each cup, there may be hope yet that Bose can fine-tune the results through future firmware updates.</p><p>Bose prefers physical buttons over touch controls, though you get a little of both here. Apart from the multifunction and Bluetooth buttons, you get a volume slider on the right cup indicated by a visible strip. They&apos;re pretty limited anyway. Press the multifunction button to play/pause, double-tap to skip a track, triple-tap to repeat, and long press to switch between ANC and Aware. The Bluetooth button defaults as a battery check, while the volume slider can shortcut to a chosen option on the app.</p><p>Speaking of the battery, Bose claims you can get up to 24 hours per charge with ANC on and Immersive Audio off. That number holds up if you don&apos;t raise the volume too much above the default out of the box. Not bad but not quite at the level of others in the same ballpark. At least you can plug in for 15 minutes and get up to 2.5 hours of playback when you&apos;re in a rush.</p>

<p>Bose doesn&apos;t give the QC Ultra headphones an IP rating, and after wearing them for some time, I can&apos;t recommend them for workouts. That&apos;s in spite of a Workout mode available in the app. It&apos;s just not clear how well they can withstand water drops or sweat. Given the price, it may not be a risk worth taking, especially since the warranty doesn&apos;t cover damage from water or sweat.</p><p>I noted some of the other downsides earlier, like Immersive Audio being a mixed bag and the lack of custom EQ presets. Bass and treble boosts or reducers are really basic implementations, as is a mere three-band EQ. The Bose Music app lacks the kind of depth competitors generally offer, where you have more choices to customize and personalize headphones.</p><p>These are an expensive pair any way you look at them. They earn their stripes on both an audio and noise-canceling perspective, but it&apos;s also worth comparing them to similar models at similar prices.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-competition"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones: Competition</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aXmRoiUuBy7xJ2bBk6359V" name="Sony-WH-1000XM5-wearing-side.jpg" alt="Wearing the Sony WH-1000XM5 from side view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aXmRoiUuBy7xJ2bBk6359V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By far, the biggest competitors are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a>. These are the headphones that set the bar, particularly when it comes to noise cancelation, but also the combination of audio quality and comfort. No surprise, then, that these two pairs are touted among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">best noise-canceling headphones</a>. It&apos;s a very close race, though, and perhaps too close to call depending on how you hear them. Sony may have an edge in customizing the audio experience, and is certainly ahead in spatial audio, but Bose&apos;s granular ANC is usually more effective.</p><p>If you&apos;re in the market for something premium or luxury, you can also consider the Bowers & Wilkins PX8, which wins points on design. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> have one of the best ambient modes on any pair of over-ears, and their home theater integration is second to none right now.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-should-you-buy-them"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones: Should you buy them?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JjvvVm8A3txEhfUUm5CuDN" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-flat.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones laying flat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JjvvVm8A3txEhfUUm5CuDN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want good sound with outstanding ANC.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit with physical buttons.</li>
  <li>You want hi-res audio support.</li>
  <li>You travel a lot.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want the best spatial audio playback.</li>
  <li>You want a more customizable EQ.</li>
  <li>You want wired USB-C playback.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>There&apos;s something to be said about headphones that just sound good and work well without complications. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones fit that bill to a tee, led by ANC which may be a cut above all others. They may lack the extras others have, but the key functions work really well, which is why they&apos;re worth considering.</p><p>Assuming your budget is okay with that, of course. They are expensive, even by premium standards, so it&apos;s best to look at these as a pair you&apos;ll hang onto for a while to maximize your investment.</p>

<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">here</a>.</p><p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> launched in 2021, the Finnish company is back with the Oura Ring 4. While it may not look too different from the Gen 3 Horizon style, there are plenty of improvements underneath that make it a worthy upgrade. Thanks to a new all-titanium design, upgraded sensors, and a new Smart Sensing technology, the Oura Ring 4 is more accurate than its predecessor.</p><p>Improvements to automatic activity detection allow the ring to monitor heart rate, too. Instead of the five exercises you can manually track, this increases the number of activities with heart rate monitoring to about 40.</p><p>There have also been improvements to stress monitoring, menstrual tracking, and battery life. The ring can last up to eight days on a single charge, which isn&apos;t the longest battery life we&apos;ve seen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>, but it&apos;s still impressive.</p><p>With this comes an improved app experience, with a new UI and simpler navagation. There&apos;s also a new timeline feature that will provide a glanceable view of your day, such as your automatically tracked activities and other entries you can manually input. For Android users, Oura is finally launching its Labs experience, which allows users to try new features like the AI advisor and meal tracking.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 is available for preorder and will ship on October 15. It starts at $349, depending on the color, and comes in sizes from 4 to 15.</p>

This week at SDC 2024, Samsung revealed that the One UI 7 update will arrive alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series, meaning we can expect it sometime in early 2025.</p><p>It seems like quite a delay compared to recent years, with Samsung pushing major Android updates before the year&apos;s end. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, for example, started rolling out on Samsung phones in October 2023, not long after Pixel&apos;s got the update.</p><p>It&apos;s not clear why Samsung is pushing the update back, but the company did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">show off One UI 7</a> during its developer conference, revealing the many visual changes coming with the update. For example, there will be a separation between the notification shade and the quick settings panel, which will show up depending on which side of the phone you swipe down from. There are also some changes that make it easier to use phones with one hand, such as the placement of the search bar in the app drawer at the bottom of the display.</p><p>But while we have to wait longer for stable One UI 7, Samsung also revealed that the beta will be available before the end of the year, meaning there will still be a chance to try it out before it reaches everyone. We hope you&apos;re patient!</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-codename-sooner-launch-speculation"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Android 15 isn&apos;t even out yet, but we&apos;re already getting some information about the next version of the OS. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-codename-3486221/">Android Authority</a> dove into some code and revealed that Google may be changing up the Android codename a bit by starting back at the beginning of the alphabet, giving Android 16 the codename "Baklava."</p><p>While it sticks to the dessert theme, Android 15 is codenamed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-dessert-codename-revealed">Vanilla Ice Cream</a>," meaning we would still have a few letters left before having gone through the full alphabet, more or less.</p><p>But beyond the new codename, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-release-date-rumor-3486336/">Android Authority</a> also discovered references to the Android 16 release window, which may point to the update launching in Q2 of 2025. If this is the case, it would be much easier than normal, as major Android releases usually roll out in the second half of the year. Android 15 is already seemingly behind schedule a bit, so it would be quite surprising if Google pushed Android 16 in the Spring, although it would coincide with Google I/O.</p><p>And given Samsung&apos;s delayed Android 15 update, it would mean the company would have some catching up to do. For now, we&apos;ll have to wait and see if this release window pans out.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>This week, in the wake of Hurricane Helene&apos;s devastation, Verizon experienced a massive outage that left many people without cell service for nearly an entire day. Problems started around 10 a.m. ET, with Verizon addressing the outage on its official X account hours later, stating that it was working on identifying and fixing the issue.</p><p>Hours after that, Verizon said its engineers were making progress on restoring its network, which was eventually fully restored just after 7 p.m. that same day.</p>
<p>The outage came at a very inconvenient time, as many people on the East Coast were no doubt relying on the network to contact emergency services or their loved ones in the aftermath of the hurricane.</p><p>Fortunately, as Android Central&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">Jerry Hildenbrand pointed out</a>, there were other options affected users could rely on, such as "disaster roaming" and even satellite communication on phones that support the feature. However, he stressed that these features were more important than ever in times like this, and hopefully we&apos;ll see more phones support satellite communication.</p>

Android Central&apos;s Andrew Myrick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-2024samsung-lenovo-chromebooks-hands-on">went hands-on with both</a>.</p><p>The new Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 features an 11-inch display 2K display and comes with a keyboard/kickstand combination. It&apos;s powered by a MediaTek Kompanio 838 chip, which unfortunately makes it ineligible for the Chromebook Plus branding but comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Still, users should have plenty of power to work with, and the device will be available this month starting at $349.<br></p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s new Galaxy Chromebook Plus is a bit more on the high-end side, powered by an Intel Core 3 100U with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The device features a 15.6-inch OLED and is touted as the "thinnest Chromebook Plus ever." The laptop is the first to feature Google&apos;s new Quick Insert Key, which opens a drop-down menu with access to various tools such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help Me Write</a>. And while this new key is currently only available on Samsung&apos;s new laptop, others will be able to access the functionality using the <strong>Launcher Key + F </strong>shortcut.</p><p>The Galaxy Chromebook Plus will be available in October for $799.</p>
<p>Lastly, Google announced several new features heading to ChromeOS machines, including an on-screen "Chat with Gemini" button, a "Welcome Recap" screen that will offer suggestions on what users should do based on their last session, a new Focus mode, and more. Acer Chromebook models will pick up a number of new AI features, followed by other Chromebook machines in the coming months.</p>

<p>Not everything is bad about Amazon Prime deal days, and I don&apos;t mean to sound like it is. You are probably in need of something, especially something tech-related, and there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll find it on sale this week. I need some rechargeable flashlight batteries for my nighttime mischief, for example, and I know I&apos;ll find a set on sale to buy at Amazon. </p><p>I also know that while I look for batteries, I&apos;ll see a gazillion other things designed to catch my eye, so I think about buying all of them. I will probably resist that temptation for the most part, and I&apos;m here to help you.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is that Amazon and other online retailers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-amazon-monopolist-lawsuit">track your internet habits</a> almost as much as Google does. It especially knows everything you do while visiting its website; it knows what you buy, what you "save for later," what you look at and don&apos;t buy, and how long you spend looking at every item you click on. </p><p>This builds a profile so the company can show you exactly what it thinks you can be enticed into buying, especially during a time like Amazon Prime Day. Honestly, this can be good, too. Not having to wade through items you have zero interest in is helpful, and it makes it easier to find what you want to find. </p><p>You&apos;re going to see things you were not planning on buying at prices that grab your attention—lots of them. It&apos;s helpful to know what you&apos;re looking for and what else you might be interested in, and try to stick to those items until you see if buying something extra is in your budget.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="A4fRHnJoXJddm7j9ebUgVR" name="USB-C-chargers-Aukey-Ravpower-Oneplus-Samsung.jpg" alt="USB-C chargers from Aukey, Ravpower, Oneplus, and Samsung" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4fRHnJoXJddm7j9ebUgVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2046" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Only you know what you can afford to buy and what you want. Every website on the internet will tell you about stuff that&apos;s on sale and why buying it is a good idea. It&apos;s usually true—if an item is something everyone loves and it&apos;s at a low price, buying it can be a good decision. But only <em>you</em> can make that decision.</p><p>I might tell you why I think you should buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> (I will be). I&apos;ll tell you why I spent my own money on one and that I think it&apos;s the best phone for the money available. Don&apos;t buy a Pixel 8a unless you want or need a Pixel 8a, though, no matter what I say. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Articles like this</a> are meant to help you decide if you know you need something but are unsure which to buy. </p>
<p>Install a tool that helps you track prices, or use a website that does the same. Unfortunately, slowly ramping up the price of an item on the lead-up to a big sale day and then slashing it for the sale is too common. It means you&apos;re not really saving much money, even if the listing says you&apos;re getting it at 40% off. I wish Amazon, in particular, would crack down on the sellers who do it.</p><p>You usually don&apos;t have to worry about more established companies doing this. Amazon or Samsung aren&apos;t going to try this one, for example. But a tool like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.joinhoney.com/">Honey</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> is something you should use before you click the buy button.</p>
<p>Amazon is not the only game in town. The company may have the trademark on "Prime Day," but everyone is going to get in on the action because every other company knows you&apos;re online and shopping.</p><p>Great places to look for tech deals are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-4693586370059157921&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals">Walmart</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1209067442414402478&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Felectronics%2Ftop-deals%2Fpcmcat1563299784494.c&article_name=Prime%20Day%20returns%20in%20just%20ONE%20WEEK%20%E2%80%94%20see%20our%20FAQ%20and%20some%20handpicked%20discounts%20ahead%20of%20Big%20Deal%20Days%202024&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fprime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Best Buy</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=ac-us-1051954877895106511&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2F">Newegg</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&H Photo</a>. All these places have a good reputation, and I&apos;ve actually purchased items from them without any issues. Comparison shopping, especially during something like Prime Day, is an excellent way to save money.</p>

<p>The cheapest thing isn&apos;t always the best deal. In fact, buying the cheapest thing in any category is <em>usually</em> not a good deal. Building and selling a quality product isn&apos;t cheap. Since there&apos;s no tactful way to say it, cheap junk is going to cost less than something worth buying. You will not get your money&apos;s worth when you buy cheap junk.</p><p>This is especially true when it comes to tech accessories. My wife loves her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch</a>, and it never leaves her wrist. She has an envelope with 10 watch straps in it that she can&apos;t wear because they turn her wrist different colors. Those watch straps were cheaper than others, but they were also junk. Don&apos;t buy junk because it&apos;s cheap.</p><p>Reviews can help but know that a lot of the Amazon reviews you see are just more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-fight-against-ai-scammers-why-it-matters">junk written by AI bots</a> and mean nothing. If you&apos;ve never heard of the brand, Google it and see what you find. Always.</p><p>Some cheap things are worth buying. Most aren&apos;t.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-bezel.jpeg" alt="A close-up side-view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, focused on the rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, remember you don&apos;t have to buy anything. All of this stuff will still be there come the week after next, and though it might not be on sale, you can still pick up anything you like anytime you like.</p><p>There&apos;s another potentially bigger sale coming on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-black-friday">Black Friday</a>, too. There&apos;s no guarantee something will be cheaper then, but it may be worth waiting for if you can.</p><p>I hope you walk away from another Prime Day sale happy with yourself and anything you bought. With a little bit of planning and thinking before you click a buy button, it&apos;s easier.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly starting a limited test in Search that could aid in user safety when surfing the web.</p><p>A small number of results in Google Search have been spotted with a familiar blue checkmark beside the name of a given website. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261877/google-search-verified-checkmarks-experiment-feature">The Verge</a>, Google is considering bringing a version of BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) to Search. The publication discovered that hovering over the blue mark delivers a brief explanation.</p><p>The test marker reads, "this icon is being shown because Google&apos;s signals suggest that this business is the business that it says it is." Google then backs out of any responsibility regarding the "reliability" of said business.</p><p>The publication reached out to Google and received the following statement from a spokesperson: "... we are currently running a small experiment showing checkmarks next to certain businesses on Google."</p><p>So far, this test&apos;s appearance is limited to not just users, but also websites. The report states the checkmarks only appear for high-profile websites like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when/if Google will roll this out for <em>everyone</em>. However, we have Gmail to look at as a baseline.</p>

<p>Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-gets-blue-verification-checkmarks-to-prevent-phishing">the BIMI indicators in Gmail</a> last year, which were symbols that actually bear weight. The markers are designed to give users peace of mind when receiving emails. Only those with the blue marker were verified as the real deal as the company looked to combat phishing and other malicious attacks. The BIMI system ensures that the sender owns the website it claims and the logo featured.</p><p>These are aspects explained in Gmail and echoed in this recent Search results test.</p><p>BIMI&apos;s arrival in Search could help Google reduce scams and other attacks, something it sought legal charges for in 2023. Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-sues-bard-scammers">the company sued scammers</a> attempting to harm users through social media and ads. The ads and posts stated that users would&apos;ve received Google Bard access (remember Bard?). Unfortunately, those who interacted with the fake download buttons were exposed to malware and other viruses.</p>

<p>Much to the chagrin of some of those in the Android space, Apple has largely been considered the "measuring stick" for both hardware and software. Arguments have been made that the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei, and Samsung, among others surpassed Apple in the hardware department long ago. </p><p>The same can&apos;t be said about the software, despite Apple locking down iOS and iPadOS in the most frustrating ways. However, after seeing what&apos;s happened in 2024, I can&apos;t help but wonder if Apple lost its touch.</p><p>Over the past year, Apple has entered a new product category with the Vision Pro headset while releasing refreshes of practically every other device in its lineup. Plus, we&apos;re expecting at least one more announcement as rumors suggest Apple has an event planned this month to unveil new Macs and hopefully a refreshed iPad Mini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple has proven that companies don&apos;t need to reinvent the hardware wheel when releasing a refreshed device. For instance, the only major differences between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and iPhone 16 Pro are a new "Camera Control" button and bezels that are ever-so-slightly slimmer than before. </p><p>The majority of the focus from Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16-series-has-me-convinced-apple-needs-a-foldable">iPhone 16</a> event was showcasing the various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-outsourcing-openai-feels-unapple-but-unsurprising">AI-powered features</a> slated to come to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. There&apos;s just one problem though — none of the exciting features are actually available yet. So basically, Apple just took the same approach that we used to lambast other companies in that it announced features that won&apos;t actually be available at launch. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cwzcPjjSGaom2cFv4uLqNh" name="iphone-16-pro-max-render-showing-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="iPhone 16 Pro in hand glowing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwzcPjjSGaom2cFv4uLqNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hardly any of these features were available with the final release of iOS 18, which arrived alongside the iPhone 16 series. Instead, it seems that Apple will be rolling out features in waves, starting with iOS 18.1. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/22/apple-intelligence-features-timing/">MacRumors </a>laid out the rumors of when to expect features to arrive pretty well, and here&apos;s how things are looking:</p>

<p>If Apple sticks to this rumored timeline, it means that the company&apos;s latest device won&apos;t have all of the new features until it&apos;s already been on the market for six months. There&apos;s also the potential of even more frustration as you can&apos;t watch TV for more than an hour without seeing an iPhone commercial touting Apple Intelligence. </p>

<p>Just a little bit of good old-fashioned deception because we know Apple doesn&apos;t want to miss out on the holiday shopping season. </p><p>While delaying features isn&apos;t great, it&apos;s not as bad as what iPad Pro owners have had to endure. Apple introduced and released the M4-powered iPad Pro back in May 2024. This remains the only device in Apple&apos;s lineup to be powered by the M4 chip, which is likely to be rectified later in October. </p><p>The problem is that iPadOS 18 was released in mid-September, and the update was removed for those with the M4 iPad Pro the next day. Some found that after installing the update, the iPad Pro would essentially be turned into a very expensive metal and glass brick. It wasn&apos;t until today (October 4) that Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18-release-notes">released</a> iPadOS 18.0.1, which should include the fix for whatever the original issue was. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK" name="ipad-pro-2024-imore.jpg" alt="2024 iPad Pro M4 on desk with Magic Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gerald Lynch / iMore)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s more than two weeks without being able to use Apple&apos;s latest software with its more powerful (and expensive) iPad model. As someone who has an M4 iPad Pro, this has been one of the few times that I&apos;m thankful to be on the "beta train," as I haven&apos;t come across any of those problems. </p><p>Originally, I thought this was rather unprecedented for Apple, and then I remembered the iPhone 14 launch. This is when Apple made the move to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">eSIM only</a> in the U.S., but the company had to rush out a day-one software update as many were unable to actually register an eSIM. So, I guess things have been out of whack for longer than I thought.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-2.jpg" alt="Camera app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not ignorant of what&apos;s happened in the Android space, but I would argue that at least Samsung and even Google have leapfrogged Apple when it comes to updates. Both companies announced a plethora of new AI features for its respective devices, and the majority of those features were available as soon as you could download the update. The most obvious exception to this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lesson-learned-with-google-zoom-enhance-feature">Zoom Enhance</a>, a feature Google announced for the Pixel 8 Pro, but it didn&apos;t actually arrive until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. </p><p>But as far as hardware goes, I think Apple&apos;s basically run out of ideas. First, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a> was added, and now we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">Camera Control</a> button. Besides that, how much more does Apple think it can slim down the bezels and use that as a selling point? Oh, and I forgot that the non-Pro iPhones now have a rearranged camera module. Woo-hoo. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LSsPjMuKnyq2HWhrp8LD9C" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Fold-2-vs-Honor-Magic-v3-09.jpg" alt="Comparing the TECNO Phantom V Fold 2 with the Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSsPjMuKnyq2HWhrp8LD9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Apple is sticking to the slab design, almost every other Android phone maker is either working on or has released a foldable phone. Some, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola</a>, have stuck to the flip phone form factor, while the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Tecno</a> have multiple foldable phone options. </p><p>I have no doubt that Apple already has a foldable iPhone prototype, regardless of whether it flips or folds. The problem is that rumors indicate Apple continues to push back the release of a foldable device. Back in 2022, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-apple-waiting-too-long-to-make-a-foldable-phone">we pondered</a> whether Apple was already waiting too long, and currently, the rumor mill points to 2027 as the year that we&apos;ll finally see Apple get into the game. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzjSRkNW25JJUjuQLCszCW" name="apple-foldable-hero.jpg" alt="Holding a mockup of a potential iPhone foldable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzjSRkNW25JJUjuQLCszCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can only surmise that this is because Apple wants to do everything it can to avoid the backlash that other phone makers have seen with folding screens that break unexpectedly. Even in 2024, it&apos;s still a problem that occasionally crops up with new devices and is more common with older models. But at some point, when is Apple just going to take the leap?</p><p>Taking a leap is exactly what Apple did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-pro">Vision Pro</a>, its first foray into the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a>. Supposedly, this is meant to be Apple CEO Tim Cook&apos;s "legacy," and while that may be true, the current iteration is simply out of reach for many, especially at a time when you can walk into practically any big box store and walk out with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest headset</a> and don&apos;t need to sell a kidney to do so. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Vision Pro was always going to be quite expensive, not just because of the R&D that went into it but also because of the hardware and technology it packs. For reference, the Vision Pro features a per-eye resolution of 3660 x 3200, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is equipped with a per-eye resolution of 2064 x 2208. Plus, Apple relies on micro-OLED displays, whereas Meta&apos;s headset utilizes LCD displays. </p><p>I know it&apos;s not really fair to compare a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/october-prime-day-meta-quest-deals-2024-should-you-wait-for-big-deal-days-or-buy-now">$500 headset</a> with one that <em>starts </em>at $3,500. But that&apos;s part of the point that I&apos;m trying to make, as Apple is already so far behind in its appeal to the general consumer that I don&apos;t know if future iterations will be able to capture the masses. </p><p>The longer Apple waits to release a foldable phone, the more likely it will end up being far too expensive compared to the competition. I don&apos;t have a crystal ball, and we have no idea what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone market</a> will look like three years from now. But it&apos;s 2024, and we already have tri-foldable phones with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei Mate XT</a>. Plus, companies have been working on phones with rollable displays, although I think those will be even less popular than the current crop of foldables. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib" name="huawei-mate-xt-tri-fold-screen-unfolded.jpeg" alt="The Huawei Mate XT tri-fold offers a 10-2.inch display experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1406" height="791" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of me thinks that Apple is just coasting as much as it can. The company probably didn&apos;t expect to see the explosion in the popularity of AI, so the "brain trust" came up with ideas and announced them, even though they were nowhere near being ready for primetime. </p><p>Another aspect is that Tim Cook has been CEO of Apple for more than 13 years, and there are rumblings that he may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/who-is-john-ternus-the-man-most-likely-to-replace-tim-cook-as-apples-ceo-when-he-steps-down-13769379.html">eyeing retirement</a>. With much of the focus being put on trying to leave a lasting impression in the form of a hardware release, I can&apos;t help but wonder if we won&apos;t see anything revolutionary again until after someone else takes up the mantle. </p><p>As someone who spent time as an iPhone fanboy before pivoting to Android (and now dual-wielding), I&apos;m just kind of disappointed. There are still some things I think an iPhone and iPad offer over their Android equivalents, but that list has never been smaller. </p>
