                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If 2024 was the year when AI would start to ramp up on our devices, then 2025 is the year AI solidifies itself as a mainstay in our lives. The Galaxy S25 Plus is a phone that exemplifies this better than most, with its minimal hardware upgrades starkly contrasted by the amount of new and enhanced AI features stuffed into the phone.</p><p>When Samsung launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, the focus was predominantly on AI, so much so that you could easily mistake it for a Pixel launch. In fact, after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-one-week-later">using the Galaxy S25 Plus for just a week</a>, I commented on how using the phone felt like I was using a Pixel. It’s not too surprising, given how closely Google and Samsung have worked together in recent years, to the point where Samsung’s phones will sometimes get Google’s new AI features before Pixels do.</p><p>But is AI enough to justify upgrading to the Galaxy S25 Plus — especially if you own any of the last two Plus models? And is the Galaxy S25 series really good enough to be considered "Samsung’s Pixel"?</p><p>Off the bat, the middle child of Samsung’s latest flagship series is a fantastic phone with excellent performance and a great user experience, and it may potentially be a better bet if you’re looking at buying the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>That said, it also represents how Samsung may be losing its touch and willingness to rock the boat in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">launched</a> alongside the base Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Ultra on January 22, 2025, during an Unpacked event in San Jose, California. The phone was available to preorder that same day and goes on sale starting February 7.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is available at major retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy, as well as various carriers. The phone retails for $999 for the lowest configuration, which includes 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The price goes up to $1119 for the 512GB variant.</p><p>The main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 Plus colors</a> include Navy, Icy Blue, Mint, and Silver Shadow. Samsung-exclusive colors include Coralred, Blueblack, and Pinkgold.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-design-display"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: Design & display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bMGNgaiDpvBLRBkV4yca2Y" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-06" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus face down on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMGNgaiDpvBLRBkV4yca2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2326" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's easy to look at the Galaxy S25 Plus and mistake it for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>... or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-review">Galaxy S23 Plus</a>. Samsung basically copy-pasted its design over the last several models, making very subtle tweaks with each subsequent release.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 Plus, Samsung is going completely flat; a flat display, a flat rear glass panel, and a flat frame with rounded corners. It's all very uniform and all very boring. Compare this to something like the OnePlus 13, and you'll see a very stark difference in design, from the curved glass to the large protruding camera housing and even the rear glass design. The Galaxy S25 Plus would easily be overlooked in a lineup of Android phones.</p><p>The only redeeming quality of the Galaxy S25 Plus design is the new Navy colorway. I've gushed over this ever since it was launched, but it truly is Samsung's best color option since the green <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a>. It moves away from the pastels Samsung has been using as of late, and I couldn't be happier to finally get a deeper hue. I'm especially happy that it's blue since that's my favorite color.</p><p>And it's not just me who likes it; friends who have seen me using the phone have also commented on its color. That said, there is a Coralread colorway that's exclusive to Samsung.com, which is really nice, too. Otherwise, the remaining Galaxy S25 Plus colors are rather forgettable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-04" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus revealing scratches on the back with the Oura Ring 4 top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Armor Aluminum frame is sandwiched between two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> panels, so the phone is sufficiently durable. However, if you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> or even an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> like I do, you may want to be careful with how you hold the phone. Within days of using the Galaxy S25 Plus, I noticed some scratches on the back finish, which is an unfortunate reminder to buy a case or maybe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-s25-is-boring-but-a-dbrand-skin-fixes-that">invest in a Dbrand skin</a> if you wanna add more flair.</p><p>Another reason you'll want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-cases">Galaxy S25 Plus case</a> (and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-screen-protectors">screen protector</a> while you're at it) is that the sharp corners will do a number on your fingers, especially your pinky, if you hold phones as I do with one hand. For me, it's the only downside to the flatter design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4099px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-01" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Plus outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4099" height="2306" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display hasn't changed much from the Galaxy S24 Plus. It's slightly larger at 6.7 inches and plenty bright outdoors with very minimal bezels, but the resolution and refresh rate remain at QHD+ and 120Hz. Unfortunately, the phone inexplicably comes out of the box at FHD+, so you'll have to change it in the settings when you set it up, just one of Samsung's many confounding decisions with the phone. Otherwise, it's a great display, and I don't really have any complaints about the quality.</p><p>I will say that I wish Samsung would play around with higher refresh rates, especially for those who like to game on their phones. I like that my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, for example, comes with a 165Hz OLED panel. Is it overkill? Perhaps, especially for everyday tasks. But Samsung knows how to make great displays, and if you're gonna have a powerful phone like this, the company has the opportunity to give some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a> a run for their money. But I digress.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The display on the Galaxy S25 Plus is great, but I wish Samsung would play around with higher refresh rates.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP68 water and dust resistance</a>, so it's well protected against the elements. I'm a little bummed not to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> here, as it's becoming an increasingly popular standard for water resistance on phones. Sure, it's unlikely you'll find your phone trapped in a dishwasher, but even cheap Android phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">Moto G Power 2025</a> sport this rating.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is powered by the latest and greatest chip that Qualcomm has to offer. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> is a custom-made, souped-up version of the already powerful and AI-ready <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, and it does a lot of wonders for the Galaxy S25 Plus. Paired with 12GB of RAM, the phone does not show any signs of stuttering or slowing down, which is pretty much expected at this point.</p><p>What surprised me was when playing games like Honkai: Star Rail at max settings, the phone stayed quite cool. I noticed it gets <em>slightly</em> warm throughout my gameplay, but overall, the phone is cooler than most when playing this game, even in high or medium settings.</p>
<p>That said, the chipset is one of the few things about this phone that is new, with the overall specs closely matching the Galaxy S24 Plus.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4193px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="949G5LxCYcVscWtEUTtmZ4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Quick-Panel" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/949G5LxCYcVscWtEUTtmZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4193" height="2359" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can't express this enough, but I love One UI 7. As a fan of One UI throughout the years, I admit the software wasn't perfect, and there were some things I did not like. With One UI 7, which debuts on the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung has addressed a lot of my biggest problems with the software.</p><p>The new vertical scrolling app drawer is arguably the best new addition. Oddly, it isn't enabled by default, and turning it on is a little confusing (change the setting to "Alphabetical" sorting), but once it's enabled, it's perfect. But even beyond that, I've had a positive experience with the changes to One UI 7, including the newly separated (and admittedly iPhone-esque) Quick Panel and notification settings.</p><p>Samsung adopted a much more bubbly icon style for many of its UI elements, including widgets. It reminds me of the Pixel UI, which I'm not a fan of, but I still prefer how Samsung utilizes space, retaining the smaller customizable quick toggles while implementing a new expandable panel, and stacking notifications over each other for the same app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-notification-shade" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, One UI 7 feels incredible to use. Swiping, scrolling, expanding, and closing through the software feels extremely buttery, almost like nothing I've ever experienced before on a phone. Just about every aspect of it feels incredibly optimized.</p><p>Samsung says the Galaxy S25 Plus will receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get">seven years of OS and security updates</a>, which is becoming a new standard for the company's flagship phones. It'll be interesting to see just how well the software and chip hold out that far into the future, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite feels like it won't slow down any time soon.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>One UI 7 feels just as fast and fluid as ever, and Samsung will keep the Galaxy S25 Plus updated for seven years.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Samsung is still doing some questionable things with how it handles its default out-of-the-box behaviors and settings. I already commented on the display betting set to FHD+ instead of QHD+, but I found myself having to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">change the lock screen notifications</a> to the Cards style so I could actually <em>see</em> that I got notifications when the phone was locked, otherwise they go largely unnoticed. I also had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/enable-notification-categories-samsung-galaxy-s24">enable Notification Categories</a> for better customization, an issue we had with One UI 6 that I thought would be addressed with One UI 7.</p><p>I also hate that Samsung defaults to waking the AI assistant when pressing and holding the power button. I just want my power button to be a power button. That said, I can see why Samsung would do this, and it all has to do with Samsung and Google's big bet on AI.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-galaxy-ai"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: Galaxy AI</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-20" alt="Gemini on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By default, the power button activates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, which not only got a new look but also got some useful upgrades. Much of the focus has been on Gemini's ability to work across different apps to get tasks done without much input from the user. In my experience, this worked fairly well, but results can be hit or miss depending on the complexity of what you're asking. And while Gemini can now be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-allows-users-to-share-images-files-youtube-videos-to-gemini-live">used across Samsung apps</a>, its ability is still somewhat limited for now.</p><p>Still, it works fairly well for what you'll likely need or use it for. For instance, I asked Gemini about a YouTube video explaining the recent controversy over raw milk, then told it to make a list of the main takeaways. It saved a list to Google Keep with a title and bullet points, and it was fairly spot on, getting the bigger points while skipping over some of the minute details.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VbUWoQUeuBD9FzKph57tHM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-14" alt="Prompting Gemini to create a note of a YouTube video on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbUWoQUeuBD9FzKph57tHM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Gemini was also able to accurately read the details of my flight itinerary from my screen, then create a calendar event for me, create a list with the details, and text said details to my friend. That said, there are times when Gemini will run into walls because it can't access certain apps, services, or data, and sometimes it will either skip a step or just say that it can't complete the task for whatever reason.</p><p>At one point, I forgot to specify which video I was referring to and ended up getting Rickrolled by Gemini, which gave me a chuckle.</p><p>Yet, despite the shortcomings, it's impressive to see just how far Gemini's capabilities have come. It's even more interesting to see how Samsung is essentially making this the highlight of its AI push on the Galaxy S25. Bixby is still around, but it's put on the back burner and goes largely ignored... unless you absolutely want to use it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-13" alt="Gemini showing a Rick Astley video on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung's other features are actually quite fun to use, and some have received nice upgrades. Drawing Assist feels very much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, providing a very stylistic hub where you can create images by drawing, using photos as a reference, or using text descriptions. You can also combine images or drawings with text to help you refine what you want the final result to be. The results are pretty good, although Samsung doesn't afford as much freedom to generate certain things or characters as Google or Motorola (it ignored my attempts to generate R2-D2 or Sora from Kingdom Hearts).</p><p>Another Pixel-like feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, which does just as it says. You can take just about any video on your phone and adjust the levels of various audio sources, such as voices, music, and other noise. It works surprisingly well and will even identify a crowd over a main speaker so you can hear your subject better. I also like that you can edit videos you didn't capture with the Galaxy S25.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Audio-Eraser" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Audio Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is very much present, AI Select acts as a cool alternative to extract images or text from your screen to accomplish various contextual tasks on the device. Circle a date or any text, and it'll give you the option to add an event or open Writing Assist.

<p>Mimicry is a form of flattery, and many of the features make the Galaxy S25 Plus feel like a Pixel in all the best ways. Although one new feature takes a cue from the iPhone, and another feature is surprisingly not already on a Pixel, even though it feels like it should be. I'm talking about the Now Bar and Bow Brief, respectively.</p><p>Now Bar is a Dynamic Island of sorts that sits at the bottom of the lock screen and presents contextual information, such as Google Maps directions, music controls, sports, and more. Because it sits at the bottom of the display, it's very easy to reach to control your music or expand the bar to get a better look at live scores.</p><p>At the moment, it feels a bit limited, which may be due to a seeming lack of third-party support. However, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Live Updates</a> in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, I imagine it may not be too long before more apps jump on board. For now, it's just nice to have, especially with Now Brief, which also appears on the bar throughout the day.</p>

<p>Now Brief gives you a snapshot of your day by presenting you with upcoming events, weather forecasts, news alerts, and more. If you use Samsung Health, you may find your Energy Score or activity ring here, although this has been pretty hit or miss for me. Now Brief updates at different times of the day to keep you updated in the morning, midday, afternoon, evening, and so on. You may also find photos you've taken earlier that day when you're about to wind down.</p><p>This is another feature that doesn't feel as useful as it should be, but I do like where Samsung is going with it. My briefings are often devoid of anything aside from weather and calendar events, and my health data doesn't appear nearly as often as I would like. The experience just doesn't feel very consistent, which is something I hope will change over time with more use.</p>

<p>The camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 Plus is largely unchanged from its predecessor. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not really a great thing, either. The 50MP primary camera produces very respectable images that feel crisp and vibrant, even in the dull grey of Seattle. The images don't exactly blow me away, but they're still good enough that I doubt many people would complain.</p><p>That goes for the ultrawide and telephoto cameras, too. Both are quite good and able to keep up with the main sensor without deviating too far in terms of color reproduction and contrast. That said, I do find that images from the Galaxy S25 Plus tend to feature more contrast than I would like, and low-light images can often appear surprisingly dark, even with Night Mode turned on.</p>

<p>I also find that the bokeh just doesn't feel as natural as it does with the OnePlus 12, which is able to nicely keep the lantern and the branch it's hanging on in focus while everything else is sufficiently blurred. The Galaxy S25 Plus does a decent job, but the effect just isn't as dramatic, even though it manages to at least pull in more color.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=fc71c6d8-e421-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The vibrant images taken with the Galaxy S25 Plus tend to feel much livelier than those from my Pixel 9, although the latter does a better job with low-light and nighttime images, pulling in more light while retaining plenty of detail. Samsung tends to stick to applying as much contrast as possible, so the colors on the Fuego sign are quite punchy, while the Pixel feels a bit washed out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you won't find the same fun camera features on the Galaxy S25 Plus as you would on the Pixel. Something akin to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> would be a fun addition to the phone, and there's also no Macro mode, which feels like a missed opportunity.</p><p>There is, however, 8K video recording at 30fps. Do we need it? No, but it's another one of those nice-to-have features. The new Galaxy Log is another one, which lets the phone shoot Log video with a flatter color profile and more dynamic range, giving users more flexibility when editing afterward. Unfortunately, editing on the device itself is pretty limited to just applying Samsung's color correction, but you can always bring the footage over to programs like Premiere Pro and edit there to add your own color corrections and color grading.</p><p>Again, it's not for everyone, but it's nice to have for the people who want it.</p>

<p>Despite having a more powerful chip and the same battery capacity as last year's model, the Galaxy S25 Plus is pretty solid when it comes to battery life. The phone gets me through the day without issue, even between playing games like Pokémon Go and scrolling through Instagram Reels. I manage to average roughly seven or eight hours of screen-on time in my use, which is pretty nice.</p><p>Charging hasn't been as generous. The phone supports 45W charging speeds, which is a pretty decent figure when compared to 25W on the base Galaxy S25, but I the phone still slows to a crawl when I'm actually charging it. Granted, I don't have a Samsung charger, but it takes well over an hour for my 100W Anker charger to charge the Galaxy S25 Plus form 1% to full, despite the phone telling me it would only take roughly an hour to fill up.</p>

<p>As for wireless charging, the Galaxy S25 Plus supports 15W speeds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">officially supports Qi2</a> despite not having built-in magnets. This is important because it means you can use those Qi2/MagSafe chargers your iPhone friends have to top up the phone at full speed, granted you have a magnetic case for the phone.</p><p>In my experience, this has worked just fine, and it really makes me appreciate the convenience of MagSafe charging, even if speeds aren't terribly fast. The only downside for some is that a case is necessary to make this work, but we'll always recommend having a case than not.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 is one of the first phones to launch in 2025, but it already has quite a number of phones to contend with if you're looking for a new device to upgrade to.</p><p>The most obvious is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, which features a slightly larger 6.8-inch QHD+ display. Like the Galaxy S25 Plus, the Pixel sports a 50MP triple camera setup, great battery life, and 45W charging. There's also plenty of AI on the Pixel, and Google will often release new features there before they reach other phones. The Pixel has more RAM to help with AI processing, although the Snapdragon 8 Elite on the Galaxy S25 Plus will beat out the Pixel's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in terms of raw power and performance. Both phones cost $999.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is also a worthy contender, sporting a larger curved display and a very unique design. The software may not be as robust with AI, and you get fewer software updates, but the camera is one of the best you'll find on an Android phone, charging speeds are much faster, and the OnePlus 13 costs $100 less than the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p><p>Still, Samsung has a closer relationship with Google, so many new features will reach the Galaxy before they come to OnePlus, and hardware support for Samsung is a bit more robust, especially in the States, where Samsung dominates. And despite being cheaper, the OnePlus is only available unlocked, whereas the Galaxy S25 Plus can be purchased through carriers if you don't want to pay outright.</p>

<ul><li>You own a Galaxy S24 Plus or maybe even a Galaxy S23 Plus.</li><li>You want the best Android camera experience.</li><li>You want super-fast charging speeds.</li></ul>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus feels like a Pixel phone in all the best ways. Not only is it chock-full of AI, but the software finally feels fluid and cohesive. The AI doesn't overwhelm the experience nor try to get in the way, mostly sitting there waiting for you to interact with it. In a time when AI is everywhere, this is something people may appreciate about Samsung's latest flagships.</p><p>There's a lot to like about the Galaxy S25 Plus, from the large, sharp display to the incredible performance and the efficient use of power. As the middle child of the Galaxy S25 series, the Plus no longer feels like the "awkward" one.</p><p>That said, there's something to be said about the lack of hardware upgrades. Aside from the new Snapdragon chipset, the phone features the same amount of RAM, the same cameras, the same battery capacity and charging specs speeds, and a lot more of the same. Sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2 is here</a>, but even that is somewhat half-assed.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus just isn't that exciting of a phone, which is exemplified by its rather dull design. It's nice that Samsung kept the price the same, but it would also be nice if AI and a new chip were the only upgrades.</p><p>It sort of echoes much of what I've been hearing about the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-releases-stats-that-prove-dlss-and-frame-generation-are-here-to-stay-sorry-angry-gamers">NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs</a>, which also feature seemingly significant performance upgrades while focusing heavily on AI enhancements to improve gameplay. If you have the previous model, and perhaps even the model before that, no matter how good it is, the newest thing just doesn't feel that exciting.</p>

<p>Samsung surprised many when it revealed that it would not be increasing the price of its flagship smartphone. It's available with three different storage configurations, with the 256GB model starting at $1,299. Plus, you won't have to fork up more dough for more RAM, as we have 12GB of memory across the board.</p>
<p>If you opt for picking one of these up from your local carrier or big box store, you'll have four colors to choose from: Titanium Black, Gray, Silverblue, or Whitesilver. However, there are three more colors that are only available through Samsung's online storefront: Titanium Jadegreen, Jetblack, and Pinkgold.</p>

<p>Now that I've had a few weeks with the Galaxy S25 Ultra under my belt, my initial impressions still stand. I appreciate Samsung changing the design to bring it in line with the other phones in its flagship lineup. Now when you look across all of Samsung's latest phones, its flat edges as far as the eye can see, and that level of uniformity is welcome.</p><p>There is one kink in the armor, so to speak, that I've come to realize, however. And it's the same problem that Apple faces, as there's just nothing really special about Samsung phones anymore. I'm sure at some point I wrote that the curved edges need to be banished to the shadow realm, but I don't think that was the right take.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels great to hold and use, but it's just too darn slippery. I actually think I would've preferred for Samsung to take the Apple approach from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-14-pro-max-review">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> with the polished frame. At least this would give me some type of grip without feeling the need to bury the phone in a case for the rest of its life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="TT6LzFAab259voGJGuTJTK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-18" alt="Angled view of Galaxy S25 Ultra, Z Fold 5, S24 Ultra, and S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TT6LzFAab259voGJGuTJTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's the same problem that I've had with both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> and now 16 Pro Max. The matte finish on the frame just doesn't lend itself well to being used case-less. Even if you opt for Samsung Care+, which claims "unlimited repairs," that's just another potential headache waiting to happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">magnetic alignment protocol of Qi2 charging</a> isn't built into the phone itself. This means that I can't just say "I'm good," and use a MagSafe PopSocket to keep my phone in my hand. So instead, you're left relying on either Samsung's own magnetic case, or one of the third-party case options out there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A recurring theme that I've felt throughout my time with the Galaxy S25 Ultra is that I want a phone that's worthy of the "Ultra" title. There are just a few too many papercuts that keep that from becoming a reality, and it's already started to wear down my excitement.</p><p>The redesigned chassis, allowed Samsung to make the display 0.1-inches larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. So we have a 6.9-inch slab of AMOLED glass staring us in the face all day and night.</p><p>It's a chance for Samsung to flex its muscles and show that it makes the best displays in the world, and for someone like me, I'd have to agree. The screen looks absolutely stunning, and surprisingly, I didn't immediately switch the color profile to the "natural" tone, as I've rather enjoyed the pop and punch offered by the S25 Ultra's display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-13" alt="PWM settings on Miyoo Mini Plus and display settings on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there's an asterisk attached to this and virtually any device that uses a Samsung OLED panel; if you suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</a>, stay away. While the likes of Honor and OnePlus are implementing features to help combat PWM, Samsung has done nothing of the sort.</p><p>I don't currently have the specific display measurements, but I do know that it won't take long to affect those who suffer from PWM. During our almost two-hour-long hands-on session, my colleague Nick Sutrich remarked that he wouldn't have been able to look at the screens for much longer, as that relatively short amount of time managed to take a toll.</p><p>Perhaps I wouldn't feel as strongly as I do if I didn't happen to work with someone who has to worry about PWM on phones. But I'm actually thankful for Nick, because, without him, I wouldn't have any idea that PWM is a "thing," let alone being taught about how it affects people.</p><p>It would be one thing if Samsung would peel back the veil a bit, providing an actual reason as to why it's not working to remedy these issues. That's not the case, and instead, the most popular Android phone maker in the world continues to cut out a portion of its potential client base for reasons we can't explain.</p>

<p>When life gives you lemons, you let Samsung partner up and slap a "for Galaxy" on the brand sticker. Well, that's what the situation used to be like, as there have been versions of Qualcomm's latest chips specifically made available for Samsung flagships over the past few years.</p><p>However, that's not exactly the case with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, as Samsung explained that it worked with Qualcomm to develop a custom version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite. As you probably could have guessed, much of the reasoning can be attributed to improving the on-device AI capabilities. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> aims to remove the reliance on the cloud for AI processing while offering some sort of peace of mind that your AI creations aren't directly being used to train Bixby or Gemini.</p><p>So what does the "most powerful" Android phone to date feel like in day-to-day usage? Just like every other flagship Galaxy phone. That's not a tongue-in-cheek comment, nor is it meant to be taken as a negative.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g8dEbJo2kZAwm667Xb7hUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-10" alt="Folder of emulation apps on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g8dEbJo2kZAwm667Xb7hUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For 99% of people who decide to upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it will feel exactly the same as the Galaxy S24 Ultra. And if you're upgrading from an older Galaxy Ultra, or a flagship from another brand, the S25 Ultra will feel like you just finished doing a clean install of Windows on a brand-new SSD.</p><p>Outside of emulation, I have yet to experience any hiccups, slowdowns, or anything of the sort with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, when I performed our gauntlet of benchmarks, I did notice a few oddities.</p>

<p>Of the five phones that are included in the chart above, all of which are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the Galaxy S25 Ultra only came in first in <em>one</em> test. Just one. In every other benchmarking test, Samsung's latest and greatest is easily outperformed by one, or most, of the competition.</p><p>It's unlikely that you would notice much of a difference between the S25 Ultra and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-basically-a-power-bank-attached-to-a-gaming-phone">RedMagic 10 Pro</a>, but I can't help but wonder why the results played out this way. Perhaps there's some type of artificial bottleneck that Samsung and/or Qualcomm have implemented. Unfortunately, I don't have an answer, but I will be interested to see whether these numbers begin to shift once software updates are rolling out on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Whenever I get my hands on a new device, one of the first things I do is load it up with all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">best emulators</a>. Doing so gives me a pretty good idea of what performance could be like, especially since I love trying to see what devices are capable of running my favorite Switch games.</p><p>With all of the performance gains that have been described to us about the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the 8 Elite for Galaxy, I couldn't wait to see what the S25 Ultra could do. However, this is where I hit a brick wall, one that I can't work my way around.</p><p>Between the Snapdragon 8 Elite being such a new chip, and Nintendo's never-ending warpath against Switch emulators, development has pretty much slowed to a crawl. Following the demise of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Yuzu and Ryujinx</a> in 2024, there have been a few forks that are still kicking around, but none of them have been optimized for Qualcomm's latest chip.</p>

<p>Adding another layer of frustration is the lack of driver support, as some emulators allow you to install and use custom GPU drivers. The reason that this is important, from what I've been told, is that Qualcomm's native Adreno drivers just aren't very good. And with the 8 Elite being so new, driver development simply hasn't picked up much steam for the latest devices.</p><p>So while upgrading from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> and its Adreno 740 GPU to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">8 Gen 3</a> with the Adreno 750 wasn't a massive leap, that's not the case with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Qualcomm's 2025 flagship chip introduces the Adreno 830 GPU, which makes use of a "newly sliced architecture."</p><p>This is how Qualcomm claims the 8 Elite is able to provide a 40% boost in performance and efficiency. Unfortunately, a new architecture means that third-party driver development has to basically start from scratch.</p><p>That was a long-winded way of saying: good luck trying to get anywhere with higher-end emulation for the foreseeable future. But at the same time, once all of the puzzle pieces fall into place, the 8 Elite will be unstoppable.</p>

<p>One rather surprising area of improvement has come in the form of battery life. No, Samsung isn't using a bigger battery, and we're still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-4-months-later">stuck in 2019</a> with 45W wired charging speeds. But over the past few weeks, I've come to realize that I don't have any anxiety about the Galaxy S25 Ultra running out of juice before I'm ready to go to bed.</p><p>Mind you, I don't keep the most regular hours, waking up between 7 AM and 9 AM, and not going to bed until after 2 AM. Not once did I find myself needing to pop the phone on the charger just to give me a few extra minutes of doom-scrolling social media.</p><p>This is what I would expect from a flagship phone, especially one that's touted as being 40% more power efficient than its predecessor. However, that's the same song and dance that we've been sold by many Android phone makers in recent years, so it's kind of turned into an "OEM who cried wolf" situation.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don't have any battery anxiety with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but charging speeds turn this 2025 flagship into one from 2019. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The "best" battery day I've had resulted in the S25 Ultra lasting from around 6 AM until it gave up the ghost around 8 AM the next morning. According to the <em>Battery activity</em> page, I had about six hours of screen on time, which was comprised of some YouTube, Pokemon TCGP, Discord, social media scrolling, and a few other random apps.</p><p>Even on the day that I finish off this review, the S25 Ultra manages to hold up like a champ. My day started around 9:30 AM when my wife kicked me out of bed. After getting ready for the day and checking in with my compadres, I needed to go take some more camera samples.</p><p>While making stops at a few different places, the entire time I was taking pictures, the S25 Ultra was unlocked with the Camera app open. Not once did I even feel the phone get warm, but that's probably thanks to the 30-degree weather and not so much the phone needing to work overtime to keep things cool.</p><p>Here I sit, at a little past 11:30 PM, and the S25 Ultra is at 26%. I also know that even if I don't go to bed until 2 or 3 AM, I won't need to plug it in until then. Which is just a peace of mind that I quite enjoy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UcszCUZ6wQw9zpBXQVRSWK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-16" alt="ESR HaloLock Qi2 MagSafe Charger next to Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UcszCUZ6wQw9zpBXQVRSWK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of that being said, I think it's an absolute disappointment that no improvements were made to the charging speeds on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Sure, if you use Samsung's special case, you "unlock" the ability to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2.1 protocol</a>, but there's no actual benefit to that besides adding a magnet.</p><p>Which, by the way, I can already do with plenty of third-party cases. And, I'm not limited to just a clear case design either. Worst case scenario, I snag a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-s25-is-boring-but-a-dbrand-skin-fixes-that">dbrand skin</a> and a MagSafe ring adapter, and call it a day.</p><p>If it weren't for phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-is-the-oneplus-13-charging-speed">OnePlus 13</a> with its 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, then we probably wouldn't be so annoyed. On top of that, Samsung making the S25 Ultra Q2.1 compliant, while limiting charging speeds, and requiring the use of a first-party case, just feels like a slap in the face.</p>

<p>Is it just me, or is it kind of ironic that when Apple makes certain changes, Samsung tends to follow suit? For instance, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is now 6.9 inches, up from the 6.7-inch 15 Pro Max. No? What about the move from a 12MP ultrawide to a 48MP ultrawide? Sound familiar?</p><p>Anyways, the only camera upgrade that Samsung introduced with the Galaxy S25 Ultra over its predecessor is a new 50MP ultrawide lens. Last year's model offered a 12MP sensor, which performed well enough but definitely fell flat in certain situations.</p>

<p>As is the case with the 200MP main lens and the 50MP telephoto sensor, you're not actually taking a 50MP ultrawide photograph. Instead, we end up right back at the 12MP "sweet spot" thanks to pixel binning. This allows for more light and detail to be captured, which can come in quite handy considering that the ultrawide camera doubles as your macro lens.</p><p>That being said, I've never really had a problem with the pictures that I've taken from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> over the years. My problems have stemmed from the slight delay between tapping the "Capture" button and the picture actually being taken.</p><p>However, I <em>think</em> Samsung might have solved the problem once and for all. Maybe. There are two pictures that I've included that make me feel like this $1,300 phone is actually a potato. No, like really. I don't know what happened, but neither picture should've turned out this way.</p>

<p>Other than those two anomalies, I'm almost tempted to leave my trusty Canon 70D behind and just start using the S25 Ultra for all of my photography needs moving forward. There's plenty of versatility just in the sheer number of cameras, plus, things like Expert RAW and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant</a> give me even more flexibility when snapping shots.</p><p>This isn't the end of the line for our Galaxy S25 Ultra camera coverage, as I'm also working on a rather in-depth camera comparison. You definitely won't want to miss it.</p>

<p>If you've used a Samsung phone in the past couple of years, you'll feel right at home with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Yes, there are a few dramatic changes, such as the addition of Now Brief, the more "bubbly" UI, and the redesigned Notification Shade/Quick Toggles drawer. But for the most part, One UI still feels the same as before.</p><p>I can't help but feel as though the reason why Samsung waited so long to release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> for the Galaxy S24 series was more to do with the AI integration than the actual UI changes. Then again, there's a reason why I'm writing about it, and not working on software for Samsung or another phone maker.</p><p>UI changes aside, mostly everything about Samsung's software on the Galaxy S25 Ultra works the same. There is one curious exception, as Samsung made the odd decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">basically hide lock screen notifications</a>. If it weren't for some others in the industry, I don't know how long it would've taken me to find the fix, but I really wish Samsung would stop making changes to basic features for seemingly no reason.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="keXMiPsvpagDqxFzRHAPK7" name="lock-screen-notification-settings-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Lock screen notification settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/keXMiPsvpagDqxFzRHAPK7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the very least, it could've let everyone in on the secret ahead of time. Or maybe, add a screen that shows up during the initial setup process that lets <em>you</em> decide how you want notifications to appear.</p><p>Now that I know what the problem was and have fixed it, my phone works just as I'd have expected it to out of the box. But here we are again, at another one of those "paper-cuts" that continue to add up and cause frustrations and irritations.</p><p>That being said, for as much as I prefer Google's aesthetics, One UI is just too good to pass up. There really aren't many compromises when it comes to what you can make the Galaxy S25 Ultra do. Sure, you can't have the phone do <em>all</em> of the AI tasks locally on-device, but that's only a handful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-11" alt="One UI 7 Quick Settings panel on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At least with One UI, the aforementioned problem with lock screen notifications can be remedied. It was just a matter of finding the settings panel to make the needed changes. This isn't the case with every OEM out there, as some features will simply be removed or changed without any way of "going back."</p><p>Not to mention that Samsung continues to lead the charge when it comes to software updates. Since it's being released with One UI 7 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, the S25 Ultra will be officially supported for seven years, until 2032.</p>

<p>If you managed to sit through and read my long-winded hands-on impressions, I first want to thank you. Now, I want to apologize. I genuinely came away thinking that all of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and Gemini-infused features would change my life overnight. In practice, it's had very little actual impact.</p><p>While it's true that the Now Brief widget lives on my home screen, I have made checking it part of my daily routine. However, the "shimmer" is starting to wear off, as are the other features that Samsung announced.</p><p>The problem is that I just don't think this was designed for people like <em>me</em> in mind, at least not yet. Yes, my life is busy enough that it makes my head spin, but none of those problems can be solved by AI. Why? Because I work from home, and neither my one-year-old nor I ever actually leave the house.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Shortly after the S25 Ultra arrived, I've slowly been coming to this realization, and as a result, have been trying to manufacture ways that Galaxy AI and Gemini can "help." Maybe I'm just not thinking far enough outside of the box, but I can only go so far with trying to make things up.</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that it's completely useless. I'm just saying that for someone like me, and where I'm at currently in life, there's just not much that AI can do to help.</p><p>What really drove this point home was Now Brief, with it showing the same few things every day: the weather, my sleep score, upcoming calendar events, and news from topics that I don't care about and can't change. Rinse and repeat for days and weeks, and I've learned that I'm either a background character in The Truman Show or Groundhog Day.</p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-caveat-for-me-2">The biggest caveat (for me)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ethcrET7krxVG5L9LEfpaK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-1" alt="Split-screen comparison between Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ethcrET7krxVG5L9LEfpaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For as great as One UI 7 seems to be so far, there's one thing that stopped me from moving my main SIM card to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's definitely not the lack of features, because Samsung does an excellent job at packing its flagship phones to the brim. Instead, the experience fell flat for me whenever it came to trying to use more than one app at a time.</p><p>This is completely subjective, but for me, every time I found myself wanting or needing to multitask, I was immediately reminded of my endearment for foldable phones. Of course, as an iPhone owner, I'm aware of the limitations of iOS and that you can't even use split-screen apps if you want to.</p><p>But the idea of shrinking the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display into two almost 3.5-inch screens just feels archaic. Oh and if you need to actually type in either of those app windows, you're better off just grabbing your tablet or laptop. It's definitely possible to do everything I've described, but it will definitely test your patience.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-the-competition"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AtbWfiVBuKND7Epa9qbh53" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-iphone-16-pro-max-galaxy-z-fold-6-side-profile-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with Z Fold 6, and iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AtbWfiVBuKND7Epa9qbh53.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's a shocking revelation that you weren't expecting — the iPhone 16 Pro Max is <em>not</em> the biggest competition to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's a competitor, for sure, but I'd argue that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> actually takes home that crown. Why? Well, to borrow from our review, "<em>The OnePlus 13 is the best Android phone ever made. It's the only phone  I've ever given a perfect review score because there's no area where the  phone falters or needs real improvement.</em>"</p><p>Another massive reason why the OnePlus 13 is worth consideration over the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the price. Even while "lacking" a fourth telephoto lens, the OnePlus 13 is just $899 in its base configuration with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. And if you want to get 512GB of storage, you also get 16GB of RAM, all for just another $100. I could really keep going, but just go <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">check out Nick's review</a> to see why.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> is probably the phone that you'll see most compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and for good reason. Both phones sport 6.9-inch displays, powerful camera systems, and steep price tags. However, I'd go so far as to say that the S25 Ultra is the better choice if you want the best AI experience, as Apple has a lot of work to do.</p>

<p>What if you're looking for the ultimate mobile gaming experience? Then I'd point you in the direction of either the RedMagic 10 Pro or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>. Both phones have built-in active cooling systems, along with a few unique features that help separate them from every other slab of glass out there. Plus, they're both less expensive than the S25 Ultra when matching up storage configurations.</p><p>And if the OnePlus 13 or iPhone 16 Pro Max doesn't scratch the photography itch, there's always the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. In his review, Harish Jonnalagadda, Senior Editor of Asia, says "... the X200 Pro has what is arguably one of the strongest camera packages,  and the combination of the 50MP main lens and versatile zoom lens gives  it a distinct advantage."</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want one of the best Android phones of 2025.</li><li>You're already entrenched in Samsung's ecosystem.</li><li>You want to see what Galaxy AI and Gemini can do for you.</li><li>You want an extremely versatile camera system.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget.</li><li>You suffer from PWM.</li></ul>
<p>After realizing my excitement about the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I fully expected to finally move my personal SIM card over. Yet here I stand, some three weeks or so later, and that hasn't happened.</p><p>On paper, the S25 Ultra is everything one could want. It has the latest Galaxy AI features that are supercharged by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>. Now Brief is the perfect idea if you don't have much time but want to quickly catch up on what's happening throughout the day. And I think my prayers about the camera's shutter lag have finally been answered.</p><p>If I lived in a vacuum or didn't care about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, there's a very good chance that the S25 Ultra would be my daily driver. In a sense, it will continue to be, but it just won't be where my main SIM card resides. Instead, it will be my main <em>Android</em> phone for the time being, at least until the next foldable phone gets announced, at which point I'll have another decision on my hands.</p><p>To answer the question posed, I probably wouldn't upgrade if I already had the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Sure, the improved ultrawide sensor is a nice touch, and the AI features could pay off, but there's just not enough yet that would sway me to do so. That being said, if you have the budget (or are due for an upgrade), and are using a phone from before 2024, then the S25 Ultra is absolutely worth it. Just make sure you do your due diligence and look around at the competition before making the final decision.</p>

Aside from minuscule design and finish updates, the base-model Galaxy S25 looks quite similar to the Galaxy S24 — and previous generations before that one.</p><p>In fact, some of the only impactful hardware upgrades to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> — like the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and improved connectivity protocols — might be more a testament to the breakthroughs Qualcomm has achieved rather than Samsung. And yet, despite my disdain for Samsung's complacency at times, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with this phone.</p><p>Samsung's renewed approach to software and its close relationship with Google are big reasons why. One UI used to be a disjointed Android experience, and it felt like Google and Samsung services were sparring underneath the software skin. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> is a standout operating system that feels fast and refreshing. Galaxy AI, Google AI, and the flurry of Samsung and Google software features on the Galaxy S25 feel like they're finally working together, not competing for your attention.</p><p>That, plus the tiny form factor, makes me want to overlook the Galaxy S25's shortcomings in other areas. There are some egregious omissions here, like the camera system that hasn't been upgraded since the Galaxy S22. Slow charging speeds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-arent-the-same">the lack of UWB support</a>, and 128GB base storage are other notable oversights.</p><p>All this adds up to make the Samsung Galaxy S25 my most frustrating recommendation yet. Yes, it's very good, and you should buy it if you want a small, light, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact Android flagship</a>. But I'd be lying if I wasn't worried about Samsung being rewarded for bad behavior if the Galaxy S25 flies off the shelves because it certainly could've done more here.</p>

<p>Samsung announced the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">at an Unpacked event in California on Jan. 22, 2025</a>. The phones became available for preorder on that date and officially released February 7. However, preorders from Samsung were delivered early this year — as early as late January.</p><p>There are three storage configurations of the Galaxy S25 available: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. With that being said, the 128GB variant isn't available in Australia, and the 512GB variant isn't available in North America. Despite rumors of a price hike, the Galaxy S25 matches the pricing tiers of the Galaxy S24.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (12GB/128GB):</strong> US $799.99 / UK £799 / AU N/A</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (12GB/256GB):</strong> US $859.99 / UK £859 / AU$1,399</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (12GB/512GB):</strong> US N/A / UK £959 / AU$1,599</li></ul>
<p>The Galaxy S25 comes in Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow colorways. I reviewed the Icyblue model, which photographs closer to white but looks like a mix of light blue and silver in person. There's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-color-should-you-buy">a trio of Samsung exclusive colors</a>: Coralred, Blueblack, and Pinkgold.</p><p>You'll find the Galaxy S25 available for purchase from Samsung's online store, third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon, and from cellular carriers.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-11" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's clear from a look down the spec sheet that the Galaxy S25 has to offer something unique to make buyers look past its shortcomings. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is a more complete package while costing only $100 more, which doesn't bode well for Samsung's base model. The good news is that Samsung did create something unique with the Galaxy S25. It's perhaps the last small Android flagship left.</p><p>I know, I know — it's crazy to say that a 6.2-inch smartphone is <em>small</em>. As a fond former iPhone 12 mini user, I feel you. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">Small phone</a> lovers like myself simply have to acknowledge that with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">the departure of the Asus Zenfone (as we knew it)</a>, the category is on life support. Unless you count clamshell foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, the Galaxy S25 is indeed the smallest 2025 flagship you can buy today.</p><p>While the iPhone and Pixel keep growing larger, the Galaxy S25 is getting smaller. The display on the Galaxy S25 is still 6.2 inches, but Samsung shrunk the chassis in every way. It's smaller, thinner, and lighter than the Galaxy S24. If that wasn't enough, the Galaxy S25 is also more compact than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> and iPhone 16 in every dimension.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JnkogAMm5hhnMqbLLYeFu7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-iPhone-16-Pixel-9" alt="A size comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S25 (left), iPhone 16 (middle), and Google Pixel 9 (right) on a record table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnkogAMm5hhnMqbLLYeFu7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A size comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S25 (left), iPhone 16 (middle), and Google Pixel 9 (right) on a record table. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get specific, the Galaxy S25 measures 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm and weighs just 162 grams. Those numbers don't quite convey how much thinner and lighter this phone feels compared to the competition. The base Pixel 9, for instance, weighs a whopping 198 grams. I already enjoyed the form factor of the Galaxy S24, and the Galaxy S25 feels better in every way. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> may be thinner when it releases, its rumored 6.8-inch screen will help the Galaxy S25 keep the title of best small phone through the year.</p><p>Overall, the design of the Galaxy S25 feels like a mix of the design trends we saw on Galaxy foldables and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>. There are still the same flat aluminum side rails with rounded corners and chamfered edges, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> on the front and back. Meanwhile, the rear camera lenses now have DSLR-style covers, matching the Galaxy foldables. While familiar, I have no complaints about the Galaxy S25's build — although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-gorilla-armor-2">Gorilla Armor and its anti-reflective properties</a> would've been a big addition.</p><p>Though some are quick to point out that the sharper edges of the Galaxy S25's design can be uncomfortable to hold, I don't think this is much of an issue on the base model. It's small enough that you should be able to hold it with one hand without needing to shove the corner into your palm. For the Plus or Ultra models, it may be something to consider.</p>

<p>When I reviewed the Galaxy S24 last year, I said that the display's bezels appeared smaller than any other phone I've tested. That's still visually apparent with the Galaxy S25, regardless of whether it's actually true. Especially with a light-colored phone, the contrast of the matte aluminum rails and the black display edges make bezels look half the size — and more than other flagships.</p><p>Compared to the Galaxy S24, the screen-to-body ratio has only increased by 0.2% on the Galaxy S25, so both devices will feel similar. The similarities probably have something to do with the fact that both phones appear to have the exact same display panel. It's an AMOLED 2X display that goes up to 120Hz with a variable refresh rate, HDR10+, and 2,600 nits of maximum brightness. The resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels, meaning it's only FHD+. As a result, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-arent-the-same">Galaxy S25 doesn't have the ProScaler for QHD+</a> that's now available on the Plus and Ultra models.</p><p>The lack of upgrades doesn't change the fact that the Galaxy S25 looks stunning in most conditions. If I had to nitpick, the brightness could be improved. Other handsets can do much better, and out-of-the-box brightness outdoors should be higher. Samsung's adaptive brightness tends to be too conservative, so I'd recommend disabling this and flipping on the "extra brightness" option if you're like me and love a bright screen. Of course, this comes at the expense of battery life.</p><p>Around the edges, you'll find a volume rocker and a side button used for power and voice assistant control. The side button can be mapped to Gemini for quick access to agentic assistance. On the bottom, there's a speaker grill, a USB 3.2 Type-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, and a physical SIM card tray. The right side merely offers a mmWave cutout for enhanced 5G connectivity.</p><p>To sum up, don't overlook the Galaxy S25's form factor. Its thinness and lightness, paired with the power we'll get to next, makes it a compelling option in a sea of large flagships.</p>

<p>The hardware on the inside of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is both the best and worst thing about this device. Let's start with the good. It's powered by the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy chipset, which was co-designed by Samsung and Qualcomm. This mobile platform is based on the Snapdragon X lineup, the laptop and desktop-class processors made using Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores. In essence, it means that the Galaxy S25 is the most powerful Android phone on the market.</p><p>This is reflected in benchmark tests, where the Galaxy S25 came out on top in Geekbench 6 runs. It decisively beat the Google Pixel 9, a phone that uses the underpowered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> processor. Previously, Google had the edge in AI, with 45 tokens per second supported for AI operations on the Pixel 9.</p><p>Samsung and Qualcomm completely flipped the script with the Galaxy S25. It can process up to 70 tokens per second for AI tasks, dethroning the Pixel 9. With performance, AI processing, and Galaxy optimization, it looks like the Galaxy S25 is the top-performing base model of any flagship offering in 2025.</p>

<p>What does that mean for daily use? It's twofold. First, it is unlikely that you'll notice the speed difference between the Galaxy S25 and another capable flagship while holding them side-by-side. Smartphones have been really fast for a while now, and we don't need Geekbench 6 scores to know it.</p><p>Second, it <em>is</em> likely that the massive performance increase of the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset will aid the Galaxy S25's longevity. Samsung is promising seven years of software support, and I suspect the Galaxy S25 will have an easier time achieving that than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered Galaxy S24.</p><p>This is not the kind of year-over-year performance improvement we usually see in smartphone SoCs. It's a once-in-a-decade type of upgrade, and that's why I can see the argument for upgrading now to the Galaxy S25 if you've been waiting a while.</p><p>To test how the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy pushes the battery and cooling system in the Galaxy S25 to its limits, I ran the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme stress test, which is a graphics-heavy test lasting 20 minutes in a continuous loop. I surprisingly found that the Galaxy S25 didn't get scolding hot to the touch. It got warm but didn't overheat like other flagships have in recent years.</p><p>However, the loop score during the stress test continually decreased over the course of the 20-minute stress test. The Galaxy S25 hit a peak of 15,336 in the second loop and dipped under 11,000 by the 13th loop. It finished with a final loop of 10,991. What does this all mean? Essentially, the Galaxy S25 will slow down the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor to keep the phone cool. As a result, its internal temperature only increased by 5 degrees Celsius during the test and used just 11% battery.</p><p>To be clear, this is a good result. You want a phone to know its limits and slow down before burning itself up and losing a ton of battery for the sake of a few extra frames while gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oQXsfWgx7ttJjGj6zGVDaL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-16" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oQXsfWgx7ttJjGj6zGVDaL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I said that the hardware was also the worst thing about the Samsung Galaxy S25, and here's why. There are some omissions that are extremely hard to justify. For starters, you don't get an ultra-wideband (UWB) chip on the base model Galaxy S25 — you have to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> or Ultra for that. It creates a situation where if you plan to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement">Samsung's own SmartTag trackers</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Google Find My Device network</a> over the life of your smartphone, you shouldn't buy the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy S25 still charges painfully slow. It only charges at 25W over a cable, which is unacceptable for a flagship in 2025. Wireless charging isn't that much better. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">It supports the Qi2.1 standard</a>, offering 15W wireless charging and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. It doesn't have internal magnets, so you can't use MagSafe accessories without a case. I may be in the minority here, but I think slapping a thick MagSafe case on the Galaxy S25 defeats the purpose of it being a compact phone.</p><p>Those are just a few small missed opportunities that might not matter much today but could limit you down the road if you plan to keep this phone for five or more years. There's still plenty of good, like the processor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7 support</a>, and Bluetooth 5.4 support.</p>

<p>The phone's battery capacity is 4,000mAh, just like last year. A bigger battery would be nice, but I can live with this capacity in this form factor. For most people, the Galaxy S25 should offer all-day battery life. I consistently got 6+ hours of screen-on time with a mix of phone calls, video streaming, camera usage, and social media doom-scrolling. That was paired with about 10+ hours of screen-off time between charges.</p><p>Most of the time, the Galaxy S25 lasts all day. If you're able to briefly top off the battery at various times throughout the day, you'll be golden. I find this easy to do, simply keeping a cable or wireless charging pad at my desk and in the car.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CRHV3gPNdj7YJzFsCboERF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-18" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRHV3gPNdj7YJzFsCboERF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung reused the rear camera system in the Galaxy 25 for the fourth straight smartphone generation. That's right — the Galaxy S25 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> share camera sensors. You get a 50MP, f/1.8 main sensor, a 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, and a 12MP, f/2.2 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The hardware is decent enough, but it's old and performs like you'd expect of four-year-old lenses.</p><p>The one entirely positive thing I can say about the Galaxy S25's cameras is that they include a telephoto sensor, which is crucial and isn't a given on flagships of this size. Some phones, like the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9, try to fake optical zoom using a technique called sensor crop. Nothing beats the real thing, and I love that the Galaxy S25 gives you 3x optical zoom in a 6.2-inch device.</p><p>Paired with the ultrawide lens, the camera system makes for varying zoom levels, as shown in the gallery below.</p>

<p>Samsung tries to make the most of the same camera hardware with computational photography improvements, like usual. There's some evidence to suggest that the Galaxy S25 is improved in a few areas, such as shutter lag and motion blur. However, keep expectations tame. The Samsung Galaxy S25's camera is still no match for a moving car on a nighttime street.</p><p>I've also found the Galaxy S25 camera to produce colors that look slightly dull compared to cameras in other flagships. I'm glad that Samsung doesn't take the Pixel approach, which includes over-saturating colors and adding faux vibrancy. I do think iPhone shots have a better natural pop of color, though.</p>

<p>The front-facing camera is only 12MP, but it gets the job done. Put simply, you're not buying the Galaxy S25 for its camera system. If that's something you really care about, you have no choice but to look to the OnePlus 13 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> for that.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kdfDyBSxTimtUY3xTAF4TF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-15" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kdfDyBSxTimtUY3xTAF4TF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been a consistent critic of Samsung's software approach, specifically One UI, in recent years. It got to the point that I refused to consider Samsung phones as my daily driver. That's why it should say a lot that I <em>love</em> One UI 7. I'm not sure if it's leaped the Pixel Launcher yet, but it's ahead of OxygenOS, Hello UI, and iOS in my book. That's something I couldn't even fathom saying before trying One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25.</p><p>What makes One UI 7 so great? It's hard to pinpoint one feature or two — it's more about how fresh and new the operating system feels. I prefer the split control panel/notification shade from iOS, and I genuinely like the bubbly and rounded look of One UI now. The app drawer is better, too. You can finally switch between One UI and other Android skins without the learning curve. Everything just makes sense.</p><p>Another big reason for my newfound One UI 7 love affair is the integration between Google and Samsung apps and services. The two companies are finally figuring out how to work together and deliver a cohesive software experience. It comes down to the little things, like how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wants-you-to-move-to-google-messages-and-its-for-the-best">Google Messages is the default and only messaging app</a> installed on the Galaxy S25. Or how the supercharged Gemini assistant is accessible with the press of a side button and can take multi-app actions on your behalf.</p><p>Of course, there's more to improve. Samsung should work on cutting down on the bloat further and eliminating unnecessary third-party apps from stock One UI. I don't know why my Galaxy S25 ships with LinkedIn and other Microsoft apps, but I hate it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wasn't too long ago when I recommended that Android buyers pick a Pixel due to Google's exclusive perks. Now, the situation feels reversed. The Galaxy S25 gets many of Google's best AI features, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and it gets Samsung's full Galaxy AI suite. It's like the best of both worlds.</p><p>Not every AI feature will be worth using. The Now Bar, a pill-shaped center for information, is overhyped by Samsung. If you're deep in the Samsung ecosystem or use select supported services like Spotify, it'll be neat. But I usually don't wear a Galaxy wearable and use Apple Music, so my Now Bar just told me the weather and inspirational quotes all day. Which, hey, is nice. Just not all that useful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NbsRmMjmFw7kLPqE4k7V2n" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Object-Editing" alt="Removing a drink from my hand with Samsung object editing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbsRmMjmFw7kLPqE4k7V2n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing worth calling out is how good Samsung's image editing features have gotten over the years. Object removal and generative editing with Galaxy AI is hands-down better than anything Apple or Google offer, as you can see above.</p><p>To sum up, if you haven't used One UI in a while or have been disappointed by it in the past, it's time to give it a second chance.</p>

<p>At the moment, the $799 Samsung Galaxy S25's biggest competitors are the Google Pixel 9 and the iPhone 16. You could argue that prospective Galaxy S25 buyers probably aren't considering an iPhone 16 and vice versa, so that leaves the Pixel 9 — also priced at $799.</p><p>There are some who will prefer Google's software or camera profile to that of the Galaxy S25, but I have a hard time swallowing how much bigger and heavier the Pixel is without providing enough benefits. The Samsung phone is thinner, lighter, and more compact but also faster and more capable.</p><p>With the Pixel 9 and iPhone 16 out of the way, there isn't a phone that directly competes with the Galaxy S25 in terms of size. However, if you're looking for an Android flagship for around $800 and can live with a bigger screen, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for $100 more. It's only a smidge slower than the Galaxy S25 while offering a better display, better camera, faster charging, and more base storage. This is the phone I'd buy if I were looking for a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra-esque phone at near-base Galaxy S25 prices.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a small phone with the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor</li><li>You have an older Galaxy phone, or aren't worried about camera quality</li><li>You want the best of both worlds with Google AI and Galaxy AI, and like One UI 7</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a MagSafe-compatible phone without using a case</li><li>You need newer camera tech inside your smartphone</li><li>You're willing to use a bigger and more expensive competitor, like the OnePlus 13</li></ul>
<p>After spending time with the Samsung Galaxy S25, two things are simultaneously true. This is a standout compact flagship, and Samsung also could've given it more upgrades. It feels like it's the same story every time a Galaxy device is released. There's just enough to make the Galaxy S25 a really compelling device and just as many recycled ideas and components to make buyers hesitate.</p><p>As I mentioned before, I'm concerned that buying the Galaxy S25 signals to Samsung that releasing four generations of phones with the same camera system is acceptable. It's simply not, and it feels like a sales hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">may be the only thing that pushes Samsung to innovate more</a>. The phone's cameras, charging speeds, durability ratings, and connectivity capabilities are just the quick hits of things Samsung could've easily improved with the Galaxy S25 — but chose not to.</p><p>I'm also aware that most smartphone buyers aren't trying to make a statement with their phone purchases. Most people just want a good, powerful, and reliable device, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 checks all those boxes. It's also perhaps the only compact Android flagship left on the market today. That's how I'm able to recommend it despite my frustration with how much Samsung reused from prior Galaxy generations.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Small but mighty</strong></em></p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 might not feel the most exciting, but it's definitively the best small flagship phone in 2025. If you can look past some deficiencies compared to the Plus or Ultra models, the Galaxy S25 is a solid buy at around $800. </p></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There is a report that Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-uwb-earphones-patent/">preparing to launch</a> a set of earbuds that use UWB (Ultra-Wide Band radios) to allow for mountains more music data to make its way to your ears. I have no idea if this is true and, if it is, when Samsung might launch a product like this, but I do know the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20250039604" target="_blank">filed a patent</a> to do just that. I also know it is a fabulous idea that needs to happen.</p><p>This would fix the one flaw with Bluetooth headphones — poor bandwidth. That's a pretty big deal.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-uwb-2">What is UWB?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-UWB-01" alt="Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) support on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-embraces-future-ultra-wideband-apis-android">UWB</a> is a radio tech that uses high-bandwidth and short-range radios to send a lot of data from one device to another. If you're the engineering or ham radio type of person, it's simply a new name for pulse radio >500 MHz with a complete set of standards.</p><p>You probably know that phone carriers use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">UWB to send 5G signals</a> and are probably disappointed by the results. UWB for 5G can be great (and probably is in a few places), but what it has in bandwidth is that it lacks in range.</p><p>The theoretical range of a UWB signal is 200 meters or about 650 feet. The realistic range is 50 meters with an uninterrupted line of sight. UWB for 5G does work, but it works best with cell sites every 30-40 meters placed above vehicle and foot traffic. Since that's hard to do, UWB 5G can be spotty and finicky unless you're in the sweet spot.</p><p>UWB is not just for cellular radios, though. It transfers data across a very wide slice of bandwidth, meaning it can send lots of it very fast. It doesn't care what the data is — it might be phone data from your carrier, it could be a signal to unlock a door, or it could be talking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">a device tracker</a>. It's just really good at sending big bursts of data over short distances and doing it without using a lot of power.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-it-for-headphones-2">Why use it for headphones?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="33NhG82db6SKwc694LKQmM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-2-Pro-all-colors-01.jpg" alt="All three Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/33NhG82db6SKwc694LKQmM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Using UWB for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> is both a great idea and a potentially costly one. Let's get the bad news out of the way first.</p><p>Right now, not every phone supports UWB. Most new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S models</a> offer it, as does the iPhone, then the list gets a lot slimmer. Google Pixels have it, as do some phones from Xiaomi. I'm sure some phone I can't think of supports it, too, but the idea is that the list is short, and there aren't any real budget models with it. You and I might like our "flagship" phones, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">those budget models</a> make up the bulk of the 4 billion phones that are in use today.</p><p>So, most phones won't be able to take advantage of anything these rumored headphones have to offer. And they are going to be expensive, at least until the cost to develop them has been offset by a little profit. Apple can get away with telling its customers they <em><strong>have</strong></em> to buy this shiny new thing, but Samsung can't. The product could bomb as soon as it's released, even if it works perfectly. That's a costly mistake that will make some heads roll in Korea.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="RJZWCjm3rGhHww5MvptQAK" name="Samsung-unpacked-Feb-2023-s23-family-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy S23 at Unpacked Feb 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJZWCjm3rGhHww5MvptQAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm going to ignore the "bad idea" part of this rumor because I like the "good idea" part so much. You probably shouldn't do that and do the whole grain of salt thing.</p><p>The problem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> of any shape or size is that they sound terrible. You might think they sound OK, but they still sound terrible, especially when trying to reproduce very high-frequency or very low-frequency sounds or sounds of multiple frequencies at the same time.</p><p>This isn't a "feelings" thing, either. They sound worse than wired headphones because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bluetooth-5-it-actually-better-and-do-you-need-it">Bluetooth's terrible bandwidth</a>. Companies have tried new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">codecs</a> (encoder/decoder, a way to compress music at its source and decompress it at the destination) to fight this, and they do help. Bluetooth sounds a lot better than it used to sound.</p><p>If the connection between the source (your phone) and the receiver (the headphones) had a higher bandwidth connection, it would be a lot easier to fix that terrible-sounding music. A stream of digital music is just data. It's the same as uploading a picture to Instagram or filing your homework in an online portal — ones and zeros fly across space and time. When more ones and more zeros can fly, we see faster data rates. Music would be the same — it could sound better because more of it can be sent.</p><p>Headphones are an excellent platform for UWB because of the tech's limitations: short range, optimal with a line of sight. You're going to be within 50 meters of your phone while listening to music wirelessly, and your phone in your back pocket is still mostly in the line of sight of the headphones. UWB is really good at passing through the human body, which is why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://raybaby.us/">a RayBaby</a> infant health monitor works so well.</p>
<hr>
<p>I really hope Samsung ends up making the things and the product survives long enough to become mainstream. I doubt you would be able to send uncompressed audio data over UWB, and more bandwidth means ample room for better codecs that allow more sound to be transferred on the go.</p><p>I'd buy a pair, and I might be able to cut yet another cord — the one to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.campfireaudio.com/products/solaris-stellar-horizon" target="_blank">my headphones</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>ASUS was onto a good thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">Zenfone 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a>. The Taiwanese manufacturer stood out by delivering small phones with the best possible hardware, and they were genuinely enjoyable to use. While I usually prefer larger phones, I'll agree that both the Zenfone 9 and Zenfone 10 offered something that was sorely lacking. <br><br>That's why it was puzzling to see ASUS switch tack with last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, reverting to a slab of a phone that was basically a rebadged version of its gaming device. The strategy didn't make much sense to me; in choosing to go back to a bigger phone, the brand lost the distinctiveness that made earlier models notable, and the device as a whole wasn't anywhere as good as the Zenfone 10. <br><br>Annoyingly, the Zenfone 12 Ultra doesn't do anything to rectify the situation this year — you get roughly the same design as the Zenfone 11 Ultra, and barring iterative updates, there isn't anything new. I was holding out on ASUS going back to a smaller design this time around, but that isn't the case. <br><br>While I still like the combination of hardware and software, the Zenfone 12 Ultra just doesn't do enough to distinguish itself against Chinese rivals that have much better camera systems, and ASUS's lackluster software update policy ultimately makes the device a non-starter.</p>

<p>ASUS unveiled the Zenfone 12 Ultra on February 6, and the device is launching in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Europe initially. The phone will be sold in a single 16GB/512GB variant outside Taiwan, and it will cost €1,099 ($1,141). To incentivize the launch, ASUS is discounting the device by €100 until February 28, so buyers will be able to pick it up at €999 ($1,037). <br><br>ASUS doesn't have definite plans to launch the Zenfone 12 Ultra in the U.S. or U.K. at the moment, and I'll add an update if that situation changes. It is possible we might see the device debut in North America at a later point — that has been the case in previous years — but it isn't a given at this point.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vGiGnXMyXYE9v8HWF7ygPR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vGiGnXMyXYE9v8HWF7ygPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I managed to break the Zenfone 12 Ultra after just three days of use, so that's as good a place to start as any. The device slid out of my pocket and hit the floor, and even though the distance was just over two feet, the angle of impact — along an edge — meant that it picked up a spiderweb of cracks originating at the back. <br><br>Let's talk about the protection — or lack thereof. The Zenfone 12 Ultra has a glass back with Gorilla Glass 3, and while the protective layer does a great job against scratches, it doesn't do much against tumbles (as evidenced with my unit). Most phones I use these days come with Gorilla Glass Victus or Victus 2, and they have much better resilience against tumbles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LAQpEFGZTVNMuad2KiJGSR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra back view showcasing broken glass" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LAQpEFGZTVNMuad2KiJGSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Brands like Vivo and Honor are using their own glass protective layers on their latest phones, and after extended use involving a half-dozen drops, I didn't notice any damage on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>. In fact, phones are generally resilient enough that I don't use a case with any of the devices I test outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>

<p>I guess the acute angle of impact probably contributed to the glass breaking, and it made using the phone all the more annoying as I had to put it in a case. Another point of contention is that because ASUS doesn't sell the Zenfone 12 Ultra in as many regions as it used to, there's no way to reliably get the rear glass changed — ASUS has no plans to launch the phone in India.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oGozhiwyxcHdxSM2rbo9PR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra back view in case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oGozhiwyxcHdxSM2rbo9PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Annoyingly, there aren't many accessories either. I tend to prefer ultra-thin cases as they don't add too much heft to the phone, but most case brands aren't releasing accessories for the device, so your choices are very limited in this regard. ASUS bundled a bulky Rhinoshield case with the phone, and that's the one I had to go with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z3kVUTSrGBayU96ugGJ9SR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra showing broken glass back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z3kVUTSrGBayU96ugGJ9SR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the phone itself isn't particularly noteworthy. You basically get a plain glass back with a rectangular camera island, and the design is largely forgettable. There isn't any defining feature to the phone, and it just doesn't look like a flagship that costs over $1,000.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="48iY9R2P2ZJY7VU94Zu9PR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra bottom view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/48iY9R2P2ZJY7VU94Zu9PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's an aluminum mid-frame, and ASUS says it's using 100% recycled aluminum this time, which is good to see. The Ebony Black variant doesn't stand out, but you can get the phone in Sakura White and Sage Green, with the green model the best of the lot. <br><br>Because the phone uses the same foundation as ASUS's gaming-oriented devices, the USB-C port is located to the side. This is inconvenient if you're trying to slot the phone into a mobile controller like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir G8 Galileo</a>, or charge the device when it's on a phone stand.</p>

<p>While the Zenfone 12 Ultra is lighter than last year at 220g, it is bulkier and taller than most other phones I used recently. Honestly, ASUS should have stuck with the flamboyant styling and bright hues that made the Zenfone 9 and 10 so distinctive — I used budget phones that have better character.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-display"><span>ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XtUPZRuCtmpCY44uZcKGXR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtUPZRuCtmpCY44uZcKGXR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS isn't making any changes to the panel this year, so the Zenfone 12 Ultra comes with the same 6.78-inch Samsung AMOLED panel as its predecessor. It uses LTPO tech to dynamically adjust refresh between 1Hz to 120Hz, and it goes up to 144Hz in select games. <br><br>The 2400 x 1080 resolution is unchanged as well, as is the max brightness of 2500 nits when viewing HDR content. While the Vivo X200 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Magic 7 Pro get brighter in regular use, there are no inherent issues with the Zenfone 12 Ultra in this regard — the panel is readable under harsh sunlight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gpjNsvMzSQCCt9GZSrXYWR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra home page with device in a case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gpjNsvMzSQCCt9GZSrXYWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS knows how to calibrate the panels on its phones, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra has great colors out of the box, and you get a good amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance. The bezels are just as thin as last year, and it makes using the device just that little bit more exciting. Also, the optical fingerprint sensor is located in the ideal position, and I had no problems accessing it. <br><br>You even get a 3.5mm jack, with ASUS being the only brand to still offer the feature on a high-end phone. It's not just the inclusion of the analog jack either; ASUS put in a lot of work to deliver great audio, and the collaboration with Dirac genuinely makes a difference.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the only thing I'll say about it is that ASUS should have used the same coating at the back too. Gaming or consuming content on the device is highly enjoyable, and other than the limited selection of always-on styles, I don't have any problems with the panel on the phone.</p>

<p>ASUS clearly knows how to make phones with top-notch hardware, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra is a true powerhouse. Similar to its predecessors, the device comes with the latest Qualcomm silicon, and it is about the fastest mobile chipset available today — it even outshines the A18 in single-core workloads. <br><br>I got the 16GB/512GB variant of the device, and this is the variant that ASUS is rolling out globally. ASUS did a fantastic job setting up the phone, and it absolutely flies — this is the fastest phone I used in 2025. There are no slowdowns, no glitches or stutters, and the phone does a terrific job in demanding games. It has stricter thermal limitations than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, and honestly, that's a good thing; the phone doesn't get absurdly hot, but it still manages to deliver stable framerates.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be astonishing that the Zenfone 12 Ultra posted the highest scores in the likes of Geekbench 6. A higher thermal limit than most other devices in this category — it went up to 46 degrees in 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test — combined with great optimization gives the phone a distinct advantage, and even though it isn't branded as such, this is basically one of the best Android gaming phones you can get today.</p>
<p>There are plenty of cool additions as well; ASUS has a back tap gesture that's inherently customizable, and interestingly, the gesture works even with a bulky case. ASUS also leverages the entire Qualcomm suite of options, so you get the AptX HD and AptX Lossless codecs as standard. <br><br>I didn't run into any issues with connectivity — either in the house or outside — and other than the vibration motor lacking granularity, there are no problems whatsoever with the hardware. ASUS continues to excel in this area, and if you want a powerful phone designed for gaming, you'll love what the Zenfone 12 Ultra has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CbitaGw8Se49Gq3ZPFhARR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra battery stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbitaGw8Se49Gq3ZPFhARR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the battery side of things, the phone gets the same 5500mAh battery as last year. It's split into dual 2750mAh units, and uses the standard USB PD 65W protocol to charge, so you can use any PD charger with ease. This is relevant, because ASUS no longer bundles a charger in the box. I'm annoyed that other Android brands are starting to follow Samsung and Google, and I don't see why ASUS couldn't just bundle the charger with the package. <br><br>Anyway, the phone lasts a day without any problems, and there's no anxiety whatsoever with regards to the battery running out before the end of the day — even with heavy use. It takes 44 minutes to charge the battery using a 65W PD charger, and while it isn't the longest-lasting device I tested in 2025 — that's the Vivo X200 Pro — it easily lasts a day, and that's good enough.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-cameras"><span>ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wbqwMmevvdhvbetyNNxLVR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra back view in case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wbqwMmevvdhvbetyNNxLVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS went with a 50MP main camera that features Sony's Lytia-700 imaging module, and you get a 32MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 13MP wide-angle lens. Alongside the new main camera, ASUS tweaked the gimbal stabilization system to allow the device to take even better videos. Outside of that, there are no differences to the Zenfone 11 Ultra — ASUS is using the same lenses on the auxiliary cameras as last year. <br><br>The camera interface hasn't changed from last year, but there's a document scanning option now, and an easier way to trigger a timer. You get the usual AI-assisted shooting modes, and they do a decent enough job ensuring the subject is always in focus. The new gimbal stabilization tech is better than last year, and you see a noticeable difference when you move around whilst taking videos. <br><br>However, video quality itself isn't the best, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra doesn't come anywhere close to its rivals in this area. Annoyingly, 4K60 video is limited to the main camera, so you can't use the mode with the auxiliary sensors. This severely inhibits the versatility of the cameras, and honestly, if you plan on taking a lot of videos, I'd suggest getting the Vivo X200 Pro instead.</p>

<p>Coming to photos, the Zenfone 12 Ultra has good dynamic range and color accuracy in daylight shots, and foliage is rendered accurately without any aggressive artifacting. It has issues focusing at times, and it doesn't do anywhere as well as the Pixel 9 Pro XL or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> at taking photos of fast-moving subjects. <br><br>The auxiliary lenses are decent enough, but yet again, they don't have the same level of detail or color fidelity as other high-end phones, and this is noticeable in low-light imagery. The main camera, however, does a much better job in challenging situations than previous years, and I have no qualms about that sensor. <br><br>I seem to say this every year, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra has the best camera package ASUS delivered to date. However, it isn't anywhere as good as what other Chinese brands are offering at the moment. If you don't intend to use the cameras too much and instead want a powerful phone that also takes passable photos, the Zenfone 12 Ultra is still a good choice. But if you want best-in-class imaging modules and camera tuning, you'll need to get the X200 Pro or the Find X8 Pro.</p>

<p>ASUS has one of the best software interfaces of any Android phone today. There isn't a vanilla UI as such with Android these days, but the Taiwanese brand did a great job balancing minimal styling with extensive customizability, and using the interface evokes fond memories of OxygenOS 9.5. <br><br>The interface is optimized incredibly well, and it has better fluidity than just about any other phone today — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, Vivo X200 Pro, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's just a delight to use the UI, and I'm a fan of the customizability on offer; you can endlessly tweak gestures, styling of the volume slider and notification pane, power menu, call screen, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p6eCwDjRia5UFYuN4jnyTR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra AI utilities page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p6eCwDjRia5UFYuN4jnyTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, ASUS put in the work in rolling out utilities you'll actually end up using, and that alone makes ZenUI stand out. The phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and like every other manufacturer, ASUS is doubling down on AI. Thankfully, ASUS clearly delineates between cloud and on-device AI, so if you don't want your data going to a server, you can just choose to use the built-in language models. <br><br>There's good news on that front, with ASUS noting that the Zenfone 12 Ultra uses Meta's Llama 3 8B language model to power on-device AI summarization. You also get real-time translation and semantic search — where it searches metadata to pull up useful info — and both of these are run entirely on-device. AI-assisted transcribing, document summaries, and article summaries use a combination of cloud and on-device AI, and all of these features do a good enough job in regular use. <br><br>Look, I'm not the biggest fan of AI features, and my usage of most of these utilities extends to testing them out for the review. But I do so with all phones that cross my desk, and I'll admit that ASUS does a better job in this regard than most manufacturers. I still think Google has the definite edge when it comes to phone-based AI utilities, but ASUS is doing all the right things.</p>
<p>Talking about doing the right thing, the one area where ASUS needs to be better is software updates. The Zenfone 12 Ultra will get just two Android platform updates and five years of security updates, and that just isn't enough. Even budget phones now routinely offer three updates — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing's Phone 2a</a> — so there's no excuse for a device that costs over $1,000 to get two platform updates in 2025. <br><br>This has always been a sore point with ASUS's devices in the past, and I assumed the brand would change its stance in 2025 — that just isn't the case.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gUU79VzmuNqQzV4vn4hu9g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUU79VzmuNqQzV4vn4hu9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need a high-end phone in 2025, you should consider getting the OnePlus 13. OnePlus nailed the basics this time, with the device featuring a design that's better to hold and use. The blue leather model in particular looks striking, and after nearly a month of use, I didn't see any issues with durability or build quality. <br><br>The cameras are outstanding, and the hardware is among the best you can get today. While it doesn't match the Zenfone 12 Ultra at gaming, that's about the only negative I can think of. The battery lasts a day and a half, it doesn't take as long to charge, and the software is optimized incredibly well. In short, the OnePlus 13 is the new yardstick, and coming in at $899, it doesn't cost as much as ASUS's offering. <br><br>If you don't need the best cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-review">Nubia's Z70 Ultra</a> is a decent alternative. It also has terrific hardware, and while the software isn't anywhere as good as the Zenfone 12 Ultra, it has a relatively clean UI and is optimized very well. And at $729, it is a much better value.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNo2WuCRAsUTjM8PgHTmWR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNo2WuCRAsUTjM8PgHTmWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best hardware package</li><li>You need clean software without any bloat</li><li>You want terrific battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need long-term Android updates</li><li>You want the best cameras</li><li>You need a phone with a stylish design</li></ul>
<p>I tend to like ASUS's phones for one simple reason: the software is tuned to my tastes. The clean interface along with extensive customizability and great optimization leads to an experience that's enjoyable, and it is a genuine differentiator. Of course, the hardware plays a big part in this as well, and ASUS has once again delivered one of the strongest hardware packages around. <br><br>But that's the thing — while I like using the phone quite a bit, I wouldn't recommend it. Given that the Zenfone 12 Ultra is a high-end device, I'll have to judge it against other flagships, and it just doesn't measure up in a lot of areas; the cameras don't come close to the X200 Pro, Honor Magic 7 Pro, or the Pixel 9 Pro XL, the design isn't distinctive enough, and ASUS's middling software update policy is infuriating. <br><br>It's not that the Zenfone 12 Ultra is a bad phone — far from it — but it is going up against strong rivals, and I can't help but feel that it just isn't good enough for what it costs. These shortcomings would have been excusable on a $500 phone, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra costs more than double that, and in this category, even minor flaws become deal-breakers — which is exactly the case here.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following the launch of the ASUS ROG Phone 9 FE, the company is dropping its newest Zenfone.</p><p>ASUS has announced the launch of the Zenfone 12 Ultra. At first glance, the latest device looks similar to the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">11 Ultra</a> from last March. This year, ASUS states that it has "prioritized simplicity, elegance, and beauty." The 12 Ultra has adopted a Zen-aesthetic with softer colors with its available designs. ASUS has also utilized recycled products to craft the phone, like its 22% recycled glass screen and 100% recycled aluminum frame.</p><p>Flipping over to the screen, users get a 6.78-inch FHD Plus screen with a 120Hz refresh rate for standard scrolling/browsing. Consumers can bump this up to 144Hz during gaming to ensure those frames in Honkai: Star Rail or Zenless Zone Zero stay fresh.</p><p>The back of the device features a rectangular camera array, consisting of a 50MP Sony Lytia 500 2x lossless primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 32MP telephoto sensor with "built-in" OIS (optical image stabilization). The punch-hole selfie camera arrives at 32MP with a 90-degree FOV (field of view).</p><p>The Zenfone 12 Ultra utilizes a 6-axis Hybrid Gimbal Stabilizer 4.0, which should aid users with anti-shake and "real-time FOV adjustments."</p>

<p>Performance-wise, the Zenfone 12 Ultra leverages Qualcomm's supercharged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. ASUS states this SoC is joined by the Adreno 830 GPU.</p><p>The latest device launch features a healthy array of on-device AI features for potential Zenfone 12 Ultra consumers. The press release states users will find tools like AI Tracking for subject detection in videos, AI Portrait Video 2.0 during 4K recordings for "precision tracking," and AI Voice Clarity.</p><p>Similar to what you'd find on a Google Pixel 9, ASUS has brought in AI Magic Fill, a tool that lets users remove objects from photos. There's also a way to use its generative AI to "perfectly fill the photo." Additionally, AI Unblur comes in to help spruce up those shots that you need to rush to take.</p><p>The phone's 5,500mAh battery with 65W HyperCharge and 15W wireless charging capabilities will help keep users scrolling. Internally, users can purchase the Zenfone 12 Ultra with up to 16GB RAM and up to 512GB of storage.</p><p>ASUS states the Zenfone 12 Ultra is available in three colors: Sage Green, Ebony Black, and Sakura White. Unfortunately, the company has not said when or if this device will arrive in the U.S. For now, folks in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Europe will see this for €1,099 (~$1,143).</p><p>As previously stated, ASUS also just wrapped up the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-fe-overseas-launch-details">the ROG Phone 9 FE</a>. Like the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-series-launch">Phone 9 series</a>, the recent FE and the newest Zenfone 12 Ultra all feature similar hardware specs that consumers may enjoy.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While AptX is standard on high-end phones, most manufacturers refuse to leverage Qualcomm's entire suite of codecs. Case in point is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>; it has AptX and AptX HD alongside LDAC and LHDC, but you miss out on AptX Adaptive and AptX Lossless. This isn't an issue most of the time, as an overwhelming majority of earbuds connect via standard AptX or LDAC anyway. <br><br>But if you bought earbuds or a headset that has AptX Lossless and want to get the best possible sound, you'll ideally want to buy a phone that integrates the codec. There's just one issue with that — not many phones have AptX Lossless, and outside of ASUS and select Xiaomi high-end devices, there aren't many choices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y2edSGyPV5cq5tHA2UKURj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2edSGyPV5cq5tHA2UKURj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, there's an easier alternative — Fiio's BT11. It is a Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter that you can use with your phone, tablet, PS5, Switch, and any other gaming handheld, and its key differentiator is that it includes all of Qualcomm's high-res codes: AptX, AptX HD, AptX Lossless, AptX Adaptive, and AptX Low Latency.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4q6Y3ew8WiV6v8uDK6zpKj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4q6Y3ew8WiV6v8uDK6zpKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BT11 comes with LDAC as well, making it one of the most versatile transmitters you can get today. I've been using it for the better part of two months, and while Fiio had issues with the product at launch — it wouldn't connect easily — those have been ironed out. The transmitter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008328307921.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt">costs $44</a>, and as of writing, it wasn't listed on Amazon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KFCAyimWvoEVXpLkdTRANj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KFCAyimWvoEVXpLkdTRANj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BT11 is tiny, and it doesn't take up much room at all. It connects via USB-C, and you can use it with just about any device that uses the standard. You get a USB-C to USB-A dongle in the box if you need to connect it to a Windows machine or older MacBook. <br><br>Before you pair buds to the BT11, you'll need to ensure it is connectable; just plug in the dongle to your phone and launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiio.control">Fiio Control</a>. It should detect the BT11 once it's plugged into your phone, and you'll be able to see that it is in pairing mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ftrqc9A2QTF6rQwT7mN9Uj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ftrqc9A2QTF6rQwT7mN9Uj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Connecting earbuds to the BT11 will sound counter-intuitive, particularly if you're using the transmitter with a phone. Basically, you don't use your phone's Bluetooth to connect to the buds, instead relying on the BT11. But as the transmitter doesn't have an interface to connect, you'll need to follow the flashing LED; it's ready to pair to earbuds when it's alternating between blue and red LEDs, and you then put the buds or headset you want to connect into pairing mode and bring it close to the BT11.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YEn4izuXUfRMQZkwHgv8Vj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YEn4izuXUfRMQZkwHgv8Vj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The buds should connect to the BT11 without any issues, and the transmitter changes color as soon as it pairs. It becomes a solid blue LED when using the standard SBC codec, purple with AptX and AptX Low Latency, yellow with AptX HD, and white if it's using LDAC. I'm testing AptX Adaptive and AptX Lossless, and in this mode, the BT11 switches colors to green.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9h3oP3pXqRfw7SxL8D7AQj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9h3oP3pXqRfw7SxL8D7AQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn't see any issues connecting the BT11 with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, nor did I run into problems pairing a multitude of buds to the device. It is confusing at the start to connect earbuds to the transmitter, but the LEDs on the BT11 act as a visual indicator, and connectivity itself wasn't a hassle — it has Qualcomm's QCC5181 module.</p>

<p>Sound quality is pretty decent, but your mileage will vary based on the music streaming service of choice. I tested it with Apple Music, and it just had too much interference to be usable. Switching to Spotify and YouTube Music sorted out the problems, so if you're using Apple Music on your Android phone, I wouldn't suggest using these until the bugs are ironed out. <br><br>Other than that, there aren't any problems with the BT11. If you have earbuds or a headset that would benefit from AptX Lossless but don't have a source device, the BT11 is a great way to rectify that problem.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OPPO is slated to launch the Find N5 later this month, and a new leak gives us an indication as to just how thin the device will be. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1887011931505955095">Abhishek Yadav on X</a>, the upcoming phone will be just 4.2mm while unfolded, and that's a considerable achievement. <br><br>Honor's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> is my favorite foldable, and the reason I prefer it to its rivals has to do with the weight; it is thinner and lighter than just about anything else in this category. That may change with the introduction of the Find N5, with OPPO clearly intent on outdoing Honor.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oppo Find N3 versus N5 thickness.Find N3: 5.8mm unfoldFind N5: 4.2mm unfold#oppofindn5 pic.twitter.com/3IxBWX9QlH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1887011931505955095">February 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While thickness and weight doesn't really matter when using a traditional phone, it absolutely makes a difference with foldables. The defining feature of the Magic V3 is that it feels just like a regular phone when folded, and it removes a lot of the friction that's associated with foldables.</p><p>The Magic V3's 4.4mm thickness when unfolded is only marginally larger than the USB-C port, so for OPPO to go even thinner is a considerable achievement. In fact, teasers shared by the manufacturer back in January show that the device is only a smidgen thicker than the width of the USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 shown next to iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1029" height="689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've generally been a fan of OPPO's foldables, and while I didn't use the Find N3, I tested its global alternative, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>. It's almost a given at this point that the Find N5 will be rebadged in global regions as the Open 2, and U.S. customers should be able to get their hands on the device. Of course, all of this is conjecture on my part — OnePlus hasn't said anything about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">Open 2</a> at this moment in time. <br><br>That said, the OnePlus Open 2 should pose a considerable challenge to Samsung in North America should it make its debut in that part of the world. While Honor sells its phones in the U.K. and other western markets, it hasn't reestablished its presence in North America, so there's no reliable way to get the Magic V3 in the region. Having a contender to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 with a significantly thinner design and better cameras has the potential to shake up the status quo, and I can't wait.</p>

<p>Qualcomm opened the 2025 fiscal year with its strongest revenue quarter in the company's history, hitting $11.67 billion primarily on the strength of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and its "long-standing strategic partnerships with Samsung and Google."</p><p>But the company also warned that the next quarter might be "flat" at best, in part thanks to strong Apple iPhone sales.</p><p>CEO Cristiano Amon headlined Qualcomm's Q1FY25 earnings call, saying that the company's "quarterly revenue records" reflect "the strength of our technology, product roadmap, and end-customer demand."</p><p>A 13% growth in handset revenue came from "stronger consumer demand for recently launched flagship smartphones and global share in Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> devices," said Qualcomm COO Akash Palkhiwala.</p><p>After touting the success of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, Amon focused on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/computers-desktops/snapdragon-x-is-finally-coming-to-mini-pcs-lenovo-unveils-new-ideacentre-and-thinkcentre-pcs-to-compete-with-mac-mini">Snapdragon X for mini-desktop PCs</a>, as well as Qualcomm's dominance in the XR space as the primary partner for Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan.</p>

<p>"We remain optimistic that we are at the beginning of an inflection point for smart glasses to gain scale," Amon said, which lines up with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments during his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">recent earnings call</a> that he hopes to see "hundreds of millions, and eventually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">billions of AI glasses</a>."</p><p>Just as Qualcomm saw a 68% automotive profit growth in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-fy-q4-2024-earnings">last quarterly earnings</a>, they saw another 61% boost for this quarter, up to $961 million — while IoT grew 36% to $1.5 billion. Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/01/qualcomm-and-amazon-announce-technology-collaboration-for-delive">announced</a> an Amazon partnership at CES 2025 to create "LLM-powered experiences in the car," and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-cockpit-elite-ride-elite-for-ai-in-cars">Snapdragon Cockpit Elite</a> has received a "strong industry reaction," Amon claims.</p><p>Amon predicts the company will earn $22 billion on "non-handset revenue by 2029," compared to about $8 billion total in 2024. This suggests that edge AI and XR business will grow on an exponential scale, making Qualcomm less dependent upon the smartphone business alone.</p><p>Amon explicitly referenced the recent, shocking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek AI</a> demo as evidence that "AI models are developing faster, becoming smaller, more capable and efficient, and now able to run directly" on Snapdragon-powered tech, with Microsoft bringing "NPU-optimized versions of DeepSeek R1" to Snapdragon X-based Copilot+ PCs.</p>

<p>In the shorter term, Qualcomm's executives warned that Q2FY2025 — or January through March 2025 — will see a "decline in QCT handset revenues" from $10 billion to as low as $8.9 billion. The main cause will be "seasonality and shipments to Apple," which makes its own custom chips.</p><p>Apple recently reported a 4% YoY growth in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">earnings call</a> last week, and is evidently expected to see even stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 series</a> sales next quarter while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> flagship sales may decline.</p><p>At the very least, Qualcomm can continue to make profits despite Arm's efforts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/arm-is-pulling-the-plug-on-qualcomms-chip-design-license">ban Qualcomm's chips</a> last year. Amon reported that "Arm recently notified us that it was withdrawing its October 22, 2024 notice of breach, and indicated that it has no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm architecture license agreement." If Arm hadn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-secures-key-win-against-arm-in-lawsuit-over-custom-snapdragon-chips">lost its recent legal battle</a>, future Qualcomm earnings would have been significantly deflated.</p>

<ul><li>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said in a leaked memo that 2025 will decide if the metaverse is a game-changer or a total flop.</li><li>Bosworth isn’t sugarcoating it—either Horizon Worlds takes off, or it could be the end of the road.</li><li>Reality Labs is under major pressure to sell more headsets and actually get people hooked on mixed reality, especially on mobile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is pouring a ton of resources into AI, but it’s still betting big on the metaverse. The problem is, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">metaverse</a> hasn’t really taken off or shown it’s worth the hype yet.</p><p>Meta’s CTO, Andrew Bosworth, says 2025 is the make-or-break year for the metaverse. In a leaked internal memo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>), he hinted that Reality Labs’ work in mixed reality will either be seen as groundbreaking or a total flop, calling it a potential "legendary misadventure."</p><p>Bosworth adds that Meta is sticking with the metaverse, including Horizon Worlds, through 2025. But after that, Meta needs to see real results and better performance to keep the cash flowing.</p><p>Reality Labs, Meta’s VR arm, has gobbled up tens of billions in funding, but VR still hasn’t hit the mainstream or lived up to its hype. The latest blow came after Reality Labs dropped another $5 billion in losses last quarter, showing just how tough it’s been to turn this ambitious project into a win.</p><p>Bosworth’s take on Horizon Worlds is pretty telling—it’s either going to be a game-changing win or a total faceplant. And honestly, it sounds like he’s leaning more toward the "this could go really wrong" side of things.</p><p>Even with Meta’s deep pockets, there’s only so much cash it can burn—something Bosworth made clear in his memo. He called out the urgent need to boost sales and ramp up engagement, especially in the mixed reality space. He also doubled down on Horizon Worlds needing to crush it on mobile.</p><p>Although 2024 was Reality Labs’ best year yet, Bosworth admits it still hasn’t made a big splash in the real world. He gave a nod to the team being leaner after layoffs and praised the wins with Meta’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Bans</a> and AI projects. But he’s betting on the smaller crew to be quicker, sharper, and more effective.</p>

<hr>
<p>Huawei may have teased good news for consumers who've been eyeing the world's first tri-fold.</p><p>Recently, Huawei posted an "innovative product launch" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/HuaweiMobile/status/1886942847104098398">teaser on X</a>, which leaves speculation to wonder if its the company's tri-fold (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/mate-xt-international-3523571/">Android Authority</a>). The Chinese OEM said, "Be part of the extraordinary as we unveil the ultimate." The final part "the ultimate," seemingly refers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">the Mate XT</a>, also known as the Mate XT Ultimate Design.</p><p>Additionally, the post features a teaser image that looks like the Z-Shape we often see the Mate XT in for promotional photos.</p><p>The brief teaser ends by saying the full reveal will occur on February 18 in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Be part of the extraordinary as we unveil the ultimate. Join us at #HuaweiLaunch on 18 February 2025, Kuala Lumpur. #UnfoldtheClassic pic.twitter.com/O1RbUrBg9P<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1886942847104098398">February 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It's worth noting that nothing is confirmed by Huawei at this point. Aside from users speculating it <em>could be </em>the Mate XT in its X thread, the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/HuaweiMobile/status/1886979608983298390">only responded with</a> "Stay tuned!"</p><p>As a reminder, Huawei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">launched</a> the world's first tri-fold — to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">Samsung's surprise</a> — in September 2024. When fully unfolded, the device features an immersive, tablet-like 10.2-inch display. The interesting thing about this phone is that users can use it in different "modes" or "states." Using a singular screen will grant you a more slab phone-style 6.4-inch OLED display while unfolding an additional screen provides a 7.9-inch experience.</p><p>At its maximum, the Mate XT is said to utilize the company's "golden ratio" of 16:11 in 3K resolution.</p><p>Huawei also highlighted its newly developed hinge for the Mate XT, which can accommodate internal and external bending. This was done to aid its durability with continuous opening and closing in a user's daily life.</p><p>The circular camera array offers three lenses: a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and a 12MP periscope lens. A wealth of Huawei's AI met users in China several months ago. AI features to help users write, edit pictures, and more were among its initial highlights.</p><p>The Mate XT, given its design, was quite expensive, starting at ¥19,999 (~$2,808).  It seems likely we'll see a high price here in the U.S. should this teaser point toward the tri-fold. But, perhaps we are looking at a global launch of the Mate XT as the publication states it received "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mate-xt-global-release-3483466/">confirmation</a>" that Huawei would do so in Q1 2025.</p>

The T-Mobile-driven operator TextNow is attempting to change all of that, offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.textnow.com/get-free-wireless"><strong>ad-supported wireless that gives you great coverage and doesn&apos;t cost a cent</strong></a>. So what&apos;s the catch? How does this free plan work, and is it worth it? Let&apos;s break it down and see if TextNow is going to be the right choice for you. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7d9b3f63-3f33-42c6-9b52-97109939f08a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get nationwide wireless for free with the Essential Data plan at TextNow" data-dimension48="Get nationwide wireless for free with the Essential Data plan at TextNow" href="https://www.textnow.com/get-free-wireless" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:93.57%;"><img id="MVKmWnK3TCRTthGQjvTMq5" name="textnow-new-logo-2024.JPG" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MVKmWnK3TCRTthGQjvTMq5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="871" height="815" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.textnow.com/get-free-wireless" data-dimension112="7d9b3f63-3f33-42c6-9b52-97109939f08a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get nationwide wireless for free with the Essential Data plan at TextNow" data-dimension48="Get nationwide wireless for free with the Essential Data plan at TextNow"><strong>Get nationwide wireless for free with the Essential Data plan at TextNow</strong></a></p>
<p>TextNow is a unique <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that utilizes T-Mobile's network and the occasional ad to bring you unlimited wireless that's actually free. All you need to do is download the app and order the SIM card (a single $4.99 payment) and your phone bill will drop to $0 per month indefinitely. </p>
<p><em>Preferred partner (</em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/content-funding-on-android-central" target="_self"><em>What does this mean?</em></a><em>)</em>  <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.textnow.com/get-free-wireless" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7d9b3f63-3f33-42c6-9b52-97109939f08a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get nationwide wireless for free with the Essential Data plan at TextNow" data-dimension48="Get nationwide wireless for free with the Essential Data plan at TextNow">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Just like your favorite streaming services, the wireless carrier operates by showing you the occasional ad in the TextNow app. These generally appear in the form of a small banner at the top of your screen that doesn&apos;t disrupt your wireless usage. Through these ads, TextNow is able to offer wireless service that&apos;s completely free every month, and all you need to do is pay for the SIM card ($4.99 with free shipping). There&apos;s a 30-day money-back guarantee if you decide you don&apos;t like the service, and there&apos;s no pesky credit check or contract to worry about if you do decide to quit. </p><p>As a foundation, the Free Essential Data plan gives you unlimited talk and text, plus unlimited data for essential apps like Maps, email, and rideshare. If you need more data for other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a>, you can easily add an hour of high-speed data for only $0.99, or a full 24 hours for $4.99. The paid data pass options also come with free roaming in Mexico and Canada. All of these passes can be added directly to your account in the TextNow app, and once your time allotments are up, the service will just revert to the Free Essential Data plan. It&apos;s that simple. </p><p>So yes, if you&apos;re a heavy data user or you need regular access to a bunch of social apps, you should probably skip TextNow and sign up for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a>. But for folks who are on a budget, trying to cut back on phone usage, or simply looking for a no-hassle wireless solution, TextNow can be a really great (and free) option.</p>

<p>ASUS is finally debuting its highly anticipated budget smartphone, but its release — for now — seems limited.</p><p>The Taiwanese OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://th.store.asus.com/rog/rog-phone-9-fe.html">revealed the third model</a> to its recent flagship series, the ASUS ROG Phone 9 FE, today (Feb 5) overseas (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidtreasure.com/asus-rog-phone-9-fe-launched-for-thb-29999/">Android Treasure</a>). According to the publication, the device debuted in Taiwan with a 6.7-inch FHD+ display with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. This can reportedly be boosted to a whopping 185Hz refresh rate for gaming.</p><p>The back of the device hosts the Phone 9 FE's triple camera array. Leading it off is a 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 5MP macro lens.</p><p>Interestingly, ASUS seems to have continued to support its new LED dot matrix on the back panel. However, its slightly watered down as the company delivers 85 programmable dots, instead of 648 like its Pro model.</p><p>The front of the ROG Phone 9 FE features a centered, punch-hole selfie camera at 32MP.</p><p>Regarding its internal specs, ASUS states the Phone 9 FE sports the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC, which was likely done to help keep costs low. The device also grabs a slightly lower capacity battery than the Phone 9 Pro at 5,500mAh. ASUS states it retains the 65W fast charging capabilities in addition to 15W Qi 1.3 wireless charging strength.</p><p>Consumers in Taiwan will find the device available with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>With the launch, ASUS states users can purchase the ROG Phone 9 FE for THB 29,999 (~$894). There's no word on whether consumers in other countries will see the device.</p>

<p>ASUS briefly glanced over the Phone 9 FE's feature; however, they very closely mirror what you'd find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-series-launch">the Phone 9 and 9 Pro</a>. Its launch details highlight Game Cool 8, an internal structure designed to help wick heat off of the SoC when gaming for longer periods — and on higher graphics. The company then reiterates "X-Mode," which is designed to help gamers "unlock the limits of gaming."</p><p>Moreover, it seems that the budget version features ASUS' AI features to help users game, like X Sense, X Capture, and AI Grabber. Each of these is designed to help people record highlights, hunt down gaming tips, and more.</p><p>The Phone 9 FE also contains AirTriggers to help you control what you're uniquely doing on your device. These triggers can even help you play retro games on the back of the panel using its mini-LEDs.</p><p>While there's no telling when — or if — the U.S. will see this budget phone, the flagship duo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-is-the-best-gaming-phone-and-its-here-in-the-us">arrived early in January</a>. Consumers can find the phones for $999 and $1,199, respectively.</p>

<p>Pixel 9a happens to be the next product launch from Google happening this year. Although the launch timeline is rumored to be earlier than before, new information indicates that the Pixel 9a buyers are in for a treat with freebies.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-freebies">Android Headlines</a> has learned that the potential Pixel 9a buyers would be getting freebies from Google, which include a Fitbit Premium subscription for six months and, a YouTube Premium subscription for three months. Additionally, users can also expect a Google One subscription for three months.</p>
<p>While it sounds familiar to the goodies offered with the purchase of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, users need to remember that they won’t be getting the popular Google One’s AI Premium Plan.</p><p>It is always encouraging to see Google giving such goodies for its Pixel phone buyers irrespective of the pricing and the segment they fall in. Pixel 9a, meanwhile, falls under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range segment</a>. The device is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-storage-options-leak">already tipped</a> to cost $499, the same as the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, for the base 128GB variant.</p><p>However, the larger 256GB storage option is expected to see a hike of $50, making it $599 instead of $559 from the previous iteration for the same storage variant.</p>

<p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">expected specifications</a> of the Pixel 9a, it will likely feature a 6.28-inch 120Hz refresh rate display. The device will have a familiar design featuring rounded corners. The signature camera bar famous for the Pixel lineup might see a departure this time, as the Pixel 9a might be featuring dual cameras (rumored 48MP primary lens coupled with 13MP secondary sensor) flushed into the back of the panel — as seen on several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">leaked renders</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">hands-on images</a> ahead of the launch.</p><p>The device underneath is further predicted to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chipset as seen on the Pixel 9 series, and the battery capacity is expected to be 5100mAh. The color options of the device could include Porcelain, Obsidian, Iris, and new Peony. Lastly, the device is tipped to have an earlier launch than before, likely next month, notes Android Headlines.</p>

<p>Threads, launched as a rival to X (formerly Twitter), has announced new abilities that allow users to make their custom feeds public and share them with others.</p><p>Feeds are a quite important part of Threads as users can create them on their own and pin them to their home screen. With the new ability, the company wants to make the platform more interesting as it creates a new way to connect to other people.</p>

<p>Making your custom feeds available to everyone is fairly simple: users can head over to their feed from the top of their Threads app, click on “Edit feeds,” and enable the toggle, which says “Public,” and that's about it. Similarly, users can follow the custom feeds of others who have made their custom feeds public.</p><p>Once a user makes the feed public, they can further share the custom feed to others. Users can head to their “View feed” page, check for the “Quote” option on the top, and post it on their profiles as a Threads post. The option is to give their followers an idea of what to expect with the shared custom feed. Alternatively, instead of selecting “Quote,” a user can copy the link of the respective feed and share it as a link or to a DM.</p>

<p>Custom feeds were initially launched last year, allowing users to create their own based on popular interests like sports, books, arts, fashion, design, and several others. Users can add up to 150 profiles and five topics to a feed — further, users can create as many as 128 feeds.</p><p>As mentioned, Threads launched as a rival to X back in 2023 while Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk, who later changed it to X. Since the launch, the platform has kept growing primarily backed by Instagram, in addition to new, interesting features. Within a year of launch, the platform has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-cements-itself-as-the-antithesis-of-twitter-as-it-hits-175-million-users">hit 175 million users</a> as of July 8, 2024.</p>

<p>Everyone loves a good "Doom on a calculator" headline, so it's no surprise that tech blogs lit up when a Redditor posted footage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-5-transforms-into-a-mini-gaming-rig-with-psp-emulation">playing classic video games on their Galaxy Watch 5 using sideloading</a>. GTA and God of War running on a 1-inch screen is undeniably cool. Only problem is, very few people have the patience and know-how to pull this off.</p><p>That's why I wanted to post a simple PSA for regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> owners: There are actual Wear OS games you can play on your Galaxy or Pixel Watch that <em>don't</em> require hacking or destroying your battery life.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/ANDROID_WEAR">Wear OS Play Store category</a>, you should find a curated list of free and paid Android watch games that are optimized to use limited storage and RAM.</p><p>The list of native Wear OS games available isn't nearly as long as I'd like, and they all have to reckon with limited screen space. But I did find the kind of games you'd <em>want</em> to play on your wrist: simple, classic games that you can enjoy for a few minutes in case you don't have your phone on you.</p>
<p>There are basically two main types of Wear OS games: single-tap games and swipe games. The appropriately named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxxymobile.singletapgames">Single Tap Games</a> has a variety of simple time-waster minigames, while there's a spin on the classic Dino Run browser game called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.retro.cactusclassic">Cactus Run: Classic</a> where you have to react quickly to and leap over objects rushing you from the right.</p><p>I'm personally a fan of this infinite, timing-based space adventure called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nosixfive.nemesis&hl=en_US">Jump Drive: Get Away</a> where you have to tap at the right moment to zoom through obstacle gates while collecting gems to advance. I don't know how it looks on older Android watches, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> has it running surprisingly smoothly thanks to the 2GB of RAM and 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>As for "swipe" games, my immediate favorite was the simply-named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastsoft.game2048w">"2048 for smart watch"</a> app. Because the gameplay is so suited to simple, deliberate swipes, it doesn't matter that the screen is so small. And unlike other games that start to get repetitive quickly, this one stays interesting for longer because there's a bit of strategy involved.</p><p>Several other popular Wear OS game apps are all about mental training or relaxation, like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astepanov.mobile.mindmathtricks&hl=en_US">Speed Math game</a> where you test your skills by tapping the correct answer, or swipe to rotate shapes and form beautiful objects in this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infinitygames.shapes&hl=en_US">Shapes Logic game</a>.</p><p>Plus, of course, now that Google has made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">kids' version of Wear OS</a>, you'll find a dozen or so kid-centric games that prioritize creativity and learning.</p>

<p>Many of the Wear OS games I've tried are on the low-quality side, and certainly you'll hardly find anything on the level you'd see from most Play Store games optimized for higher-end Snapdragon hardware.</p><p>But considering we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1eilr9r/android_app_sideloading_games_on_my_ultra/">sideloaded Android games like Temple Run</a> on Wear OS, and there's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon Wear chip</a> coming, I wonder if we could one day hope for better.</p><p>Google curated kids' games for Galaxy Watch for Kids; why can't it leverage its Play Store partnerships for a few non-kiddie games optimized for a tiny screen? Particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-games-google-play-pass">Play Pass games</a> that could fit on a small screen without ruining the experience?</p><p>I've already written about how I want to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-should-add-virtual-pets-like-tamagotchi-for-fitness-motivation">return of virtual pets like Tamagotchi</a> on Wear OS; they could be "fed" by your steps or activity minutes to encourage physical fitness, or look perky or exhausted based on your sleep data. There <em>is</em> a cute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stoneGolemStudios.Wearamon.Wearamon&hl=en_US">Wearable Monsters app</a> for raising an on-wrist pet, but it's more of a traditional pet game with no health data involved.</p><p>There's also the potential for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini on Wear OS</a> to enable AI-generated, text-based experiences on watches. Imagine an interactive fitness game that has you run to a destination while Gemini describes a virtual adventure at every checkpoint, or just a simple choose-your-own-adventure prompt where you pick between several options and have the LLM read out where the story goes next.</p><p>But that's all hypothetical. For now, I'd recommend Android Watch fans take a few minutes to download some games! They're not gonna replace your Android game library or Steam Deck, but they're a chill way to kill time.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Translate’s next upgrade might be an AI-powered feature to add more context to translations.</li><li>Spotted in the latest app update, a new "Ask a Question" button could pop up next to translations, letting users dig deeper.</li><li>While details are slim, the feature might use AI to explain translations, helping users understand nuances and avoid mix-ups.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is testing out a smart new feature for the Google Translate app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-ai-accessibility-improvements">powered by AI</a>, that could give users extra details and context about their translations.</p><p>Google Translate has come a long way, nailing translations across tons of languages and even pulling off real-time conversations between speakers of different tongues. But language is messy, and word-for-word translations don’t always cut it.</p><p>Interestingly, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-translate-ask-a-question-apk-3522073/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the app is gearing up for a new feature that’ll add more context to translations, helping users better understand the subtleties behind the words.</p><p>Hints about this new feature popped up in the latest Google Translate app update (version 9.1.76.720631521.2). Looks like it could show up as a little floating button labeled "Ask a question," sitting right next to your translation results.</p><p>There’s not much info on how it’ll work yet, but Android Authority guesses the "Ask a question" button could use AI to give users more context and a better grasp of their translations.</p><p>Android Authority points out how teaming up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>’s question-answering smarts with translations could be a game-changer. Imagine being able to clear up confusing translations, brush up on grammar rules, or tackle tricky language hurdles.</p><p>Machine translation has its limits. Apps like Google Translate can’t quite read between the lines, leading to translations sometimes coming off clunky or just plain wrong, which can muddy the meaning.</p><p>Words can mean different things depending on context, so having extra details helps avoid confusing or awkward translations. This is especially useful for slang, idioms, or culture-specific phrases.</p><p>When users understand why something was translated a certain way, they’re more likely to trust it. Instead of guessing or searching for more info, they get everything they need in one place, making translations clearer, smarter, and way more useful.</p>

Apple cancels projects all of the time, but more than being risk-averse, the Silicon Valley company has shown very little interest in the categories where it doesn't already dominate sales. And Samsung, which seems less afraid to experiment, will reap the benefits.</p><p>This is a conservative time for U.S. Big Tech. Not strictly politically — though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vox.com/politics/397525/trump-big-tech-musk-bezos-zuckerberg-democrats-biden">most tech CEOs have paid homage to Trump</a> — but rather that these companies keep laying off tens of thousands of employees in the name of "efficiency," typically those working on non-AI projects without a tangible, quick path to profits.</p><p>Unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alphabet-googles-parent-company-is-going-to-cut-about-12000-jobs">Google</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-cuts-employees-in-its-biggest-lay-off">Meta</a>, Apple hasn't had the kind of <em>mass</em> layoffs that prioritize profits over caring about your workers, but it did have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-layoffs-tech-iphone-workers-9f10788b1d3552385ee8c7b20209ce17">several</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/apple-hands-out-pink-slips-to-100-workers-in-its-services-unit_id161897">rounds</a> of 2024 layoffs at a smaller scale. And in this kind of environment, everyone needs to justify that their project has a future.</p><p>Maybe Apple's "Apple Vision Lite" or "Apple Glasses" didn't have a future. Wired AR glasses have their niche, but the fact that they reportedly couldn't work with an iPhone limited their potential usefulness and portability outside of XR superfans.</p><p>But in this environment of skeptical, penny-pinching executives looking for products that immediately stand out from competitors, it's not surprising that we haven't seen much that's <em>new</em> from Apple in years, aside from the Vision Pro.</p>

<p>Want an Apple Ring as a petite alternative to an Apple Watch? Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/samsung-and-oura-can-rest-easy-apple-isnt-developing-a-smart-ring">says,</a> "Apple isn’t actively developing a ring and has no plans to launch one," despite years of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> patents and rumors. That gives Samsung, Oura, and other indie brands free reign.</p><p>Want an Apple Flip or Fold?

<p>You can criticize Samsung's tendency to rush products to market and count on name recognition instead of innovation to drive sales. The relatively mid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> is a fair example of this. But what matters more is that it hasn't lost that greedy, ambitious, experimental tendency to try <em>anything</em> new and then iterate to make these products better year after year to strengthen its place in every category.</p><p>Frankly, as long as Apple stays out of these product categories, Samsung has less incentive to compete and innovate against its biggest rival, as it does with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy phones</a>.</p><p>Apple has never fully lived up to its Steve Jobs-era reputation for "thinking differently," but it truly feels like it has become so risk-averse in recent years that the only thing its users have to look forward to is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-has-turned-into-just-another-tech-company" target="_blank">Apple Intelligence</a>. And that applies to other Big Tech brands like Google, too, with its Gemini push and Graveyard of other ideas behind it.</p><p>My complaint isn't just about "Apple Vision Lite," any more than it is about the Apple Car. It's the fact that, again, my first reaction to the cancelation news was a weary, cynical lack of surprise.</p><p>As someone who writes for an Android site but used to exclusively use Apple products out of laziness, I've never been invested in judging one company or ecosystem as "better" or mocking Apple when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">arrives years late</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">common Android features</a>. All I care about is the traditional capitalistic idea that competition is good for consumers like you and me.</p><p>So, as the biggest tech brands retreat into their most successful niches and monopolies to keep shareholders happy and use shiny AI tricks to keep us complacent, I'll continue to lament how companies other than Samsung seem to be giving up on trying new things.</p>

It has a 25000mAh battery, charges three devices at once, and goes up to 200W. While it is ideal for travel, it is quite heavy, and not exactly pocketable. Sometimes, I just need a smaller power bank that I can take anywhere, so in recent weeks, I turned to Stuffcool's Roam power bank. <br><br>Stuffcool is a leading manufacturer of charging accessories in India, and I used the brand's products for half a decade now, including recent launches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-giga-is-the-indian-brands-best-65w-power-bank-yet">Giga</a>. With the Roam, the brand is switching to a new design that looks modern, and the white color scheme looks really good. And coming in at just 182g, you can easily carry it in your pocket or a bag, and pocketability is one of the biggest selling points of the power bank.</p>

<p>The Roam has a 10000mAh power bank, and it is quite affordable, retailing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Roam-10000mAh-Powerbank-Universal/dp/B0DFYZTJMC">just ₹1,399 on Amazon India</a>. Stuffcool just came out with a bigger model dubbed the Roam+ that has a 20000mAh battery, and that is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Roam-20000mAh-Powerbank-Charging/dp/B0DFYZWRFQ">even better deal at ₹1,799</a>. Regardless of whichever model you choose, you get a similar design and 20W charging.</p>

<p>The power bank is made out of plastic, and you get an acrylic fascia with Stuffcool branding and travel-related icons. What I like about the design is that there's an LED bar at the bottom that shows the remaining battery level, and it is a nifty inclusion. Although the Roam is significantly smaller than most power banks I used, you still get a USB-A port in addition to USB-C connectivity, and that's good to see.</p>

<p>The internal 10000mAh battery charges at 18W over the USB PD protocol, and the power bank is able to deliver 20W of power over the USB-C port for charging phones and accessories, and 22.5W over USB-A. It takes over two hours to charge the internal battery, so your best bet is to do so overnight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CKmmkhBWRpBraEMdCvTtT4" name="Stuffcool Roam" alt="Stuffcool Roam back view showcasing charging details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKmmkhBWRpBraEMdCvTtT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While 20W charging is limiting at times, it isn't a problem if you're using an iPhone or Samsung device. If anything, the power bank managed to do a decent enough job with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. Now, although it has a 10000mAh battery, you can't use it to charge two phones with 5000mAh batteries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2u9DnVun5kqDhGvrzFCna4" name="Stuffcool Roam" alt="Stuffcool Roam power bank with LED battery indicator highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u9DnVun5kqDhGvrzFCna4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inherent nature of charging means energy is wasted, and in my testing, I was able to charge the X200 Pro's 6000mAh battery just via the power bank, so you get decent charging efficiency. In daily use, you should get about 6000mAh worth of usable charging power, and that is in line with other 10000mAh power banks I tested recently.</p>

<p>Power banks come in all sizes and designs these days, and the Roam does a good job delivering plenty of power in a small package. I'd suggest getting the Roam+ if you need a bigger battery, but if you just want something to charge your phone over the course of a day, the convenience of the standard Roam is unmatched, and it costs less than equivalent products from other brands.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nubia clearly knows how to make phones that stand out; its Redmagic series of gaming phones have flamboyant designs, and the Z series has unique cameras. I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Z60 Ultra</a> last year, and while the software was buggy at times and the camera quality wasn't the best, the hardware was among the best of any phone I tested. <br><br>Not much has changed with the Z70 Ultra, and that's a good thing. The phone shares the same design language, and it's just as massive as last year. Another plus point is the AMOLED panel; Nubia continues to deliver a screen that doesn't have any noticeable camera cutout, and that's a big deal. <br><br>The internal hardware has been refreshed to include Qualcomm's latest silicon, and you get an even bigger 6150mAh battery this time around. The 50MP camera at the back has a 35mm lens, and you get extras that aren't available on any other device. Nubia didn't mess with the software either, and you get a clean interface that doesn't have much bloatware. <br><br>Like previous years, Nubia managed to undercut its immediate rivals, and the result is a device that gives you the latest hardware without the inflated price tag.</p>

<p>Nubia unveiled the Z70 Ultra on November 21, 2024, and the phone is now available globally. The base 12GB/256GB model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://intl.nubia.com/products/nubia-z70-ultra?variant=44253397942470">available for $729 at Nubia's website</a>, and if you prefer Amazon, you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/nubia-Z70-Ultra-Android-Cellphone/dp/B0DM5XSD6X">pay an additional $20</a> to get the same variant. The 16GB/512GB edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://intl.nubia.com/products/nubia-z70-ultra?variant=44253397975238">costs $829</a>, and there's also a 24GB/1TB model that will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://intl.nubia.com/products/nubia-z70-ultra?variant=44253398008006">set you back by $949</a>. <br><br>If you are interested in the phone, I'd recommend getting the Starry Night color option. It looks particularly striking, and makes the device that much more distinctive. It is limited to the 16GB/512GB variant, but the unique styling alone makes it a great choice.</p>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-design"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gUU79VzmuNqQzV4vn4hu9g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUU79VzmuNqQzV4vn4hu9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nubia didn't change the design to any noticeable degree, and other than a cleaner camera island at the back, the Z70 Ultra is virtually indistinguishable to its predecessor. It's still a giant slab of a phone, and while it is 18g thinner than the Z60 Ultra, it still weighs 228g, and it's the heaviest phone I used by some margin in recent months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hnq646pTkMXB96vp7TvJCg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hnq646pTkMXB96vp7TvJCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the Z70 Ultra is heavier than foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a>, and that's without adding a case into the mix. While the Starry Night model is obviously the most interesting of the lot, I got the regular black model, and it doesn't have anywhere close to the same design flair. The back has a satin finish that feels good to hold, and it doesn't attract smudges, so that's a win.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xmFaQZjhXhTQAGGssUPu9g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xmFaQZjhXhTQAGGssUPu9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You still get a sizeable camera island that covers the entire top third at the back, but Nubia did a good job tidying up the arrangement of the modules. The main camera is the only one that gets a red-accented ring this time, with the other modules and LED flash sitting underneath. While it looks cleaner, the main lens protrudes quite a bit from the chassis, and it makes the phone wobble when using it on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BKPJLVAeWv8ZXsHFRM4b3g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BKPJLVAeWv8ZXsHFRM4b3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone these days, the Z70 Ultra has flat sides, but there are ever-so-slight bevels that make holding it comfortable. What I like is that the sides have the same texture as the back, and that also makes a difference in usability. Weight distribution is balanced as well, and the phone doesn't feel unwieldy in spite of its size and heft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WVVMjJNFjnsLk7enHrnQ3g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WVVMjJNFjnsLk7enHrnQ3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power button gets the usual red accent, and it sits below the volume rocker. Interestingly, Nubia added a shutter button on the right side that lets you launch the camera and take photos. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, it is a physical button, but it doesn't quite have the same tactility as the power and volume buttons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7vVLnJdrsbQPV8myPxBhzf" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vVLnJdrsbQPV8myPxBhzf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That isn't all either; Nubia also added a slider button that sits to the left, and you can use this to launch the camera as well. The slider is customizable, so you can use it to toggle the flashlight, launch the gaming utility, switch to silent mode, or start dictating notes. I would have liked granular control, but the ability to toggle silent mode with a physical button is a decent enough start.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eC9eWmdtEvwGfiMFwCHU2g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eC9eWmdtEvwGfiMFwCHU2g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no issues with the optical fingerprint module; it's located high up that accessing it isn't a problem, and it is fast to authenticate. The phone also gets IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, so you can submerge it in 1.5 meters of fresh water and clean it with a pressure washer if so inclined. <br><br>I get the feeling that Nubia went overboard with physical buttons this time, but outside of that, the Z70 Ultra doesn't have any shortcomings as such.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tGfeuXYjaWTPYADdNCG9Bg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGfeuXYjaWTPYADdNCG9Bg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the defining characteristic of the Z70 Ultra is that you get a massive 6.85-inch AMOLED panel without any visible cutouts. The phone uses an under-display camera module, and it isn't noticeable unless you launch the selfie camera to take photos or make video calls. Not having a cutout mar the screen is amazing, and it definitely makes using the Z70 Ultra that much more immersive when streaming videos and gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hL4w4ccwGZ2JQ4frdEcbAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hL4w4ccwGZ2JQ4frdEcbAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel itself has vibrant colors and a decent amount of customizability, and while it doesn't get as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> or Find X8 Pro, I didn't have any issues under harsh sunlight. It goes up to 144Hz refresh, but that's exclusive to gaming, and it defaults to 120Hz in daily use — like all other phones in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="woEHkJXAoDLpwQVGFQMVAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woEHkJXAoDLpwQVGFQMVAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a dedicated reading mode that switches the panel to monochrome, and I used this feature extensively. At the other end of the scale, there's HDR10 available, and I didn't have any problems streaming HDR content in YouTube. Stereo sound is detailed, and it gets loud enough that you don't need to use earbuds for casual gaming.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PZezBbHuF3yzmUHTrGLaAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZezBbHuF3yzmUHTrGLaAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nubia knows how to deliver a strong hardware package, and while it isn't billed as a gaming phone, it holds up incredibly well in this regard. Of course, the Snapdragon 8 Elite contributes to this in a big way, but Nubia did a good job tuning the device to take full advantage of the platform. The base model has 12GB/256GB, but I'm using the 16GB/512GB edition, and I think this is the variant to get.</p>

<p>There's no lag anywhere, and the interface is fluid — even more so than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>. It is similar to what ASUS does on its phones, and it's a delight to use. It does a much better job while gaming as well, easily able to cross 60fps in visually-intensive games. This is still a point of contention on most phones as manufacturers tend to be on the conservative side in this regard, so it's good to see Nubia not limit gaming in any way. <br><br>It tends to run warm as well, but the upside is that it isn't throttled anywhere as aggressively as other phones I used this year. In 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test, the device went up to a ridiculously-high 59 degrees Celsius — the hottest any device has gotten in my testing. Thankfully, this isn't a problem in daily use, and it doesn't get so hot as to be uncomfortable to use. <br><br>The vibration motor isn't quite on the same level as what you get on other high-end phones, but outside of that quibble, I don't have anything to point out on the hardware side of things. The Z70 Ultra uses the entire suite of Qualcomm codecs — just like ASUS — so you get all the high-res AptX codecs you need.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="havQ94HswZhLZM8HzrSaAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/havQ94HswZhLZM8HzrSaAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to battery life, the Z70 Ultra easily manages to last a day and a half between charges, and that's down to the massive 6150mAh silicon-carbide battery. While not the best phone I used in this regard — Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> still holds that title — there's no battery anxiety whatsoever, and even with heavy use, the phone managed to last over a day with relative ease. <br><br>When you do need to charge the device, the bundled 80W charger takes under 50 minutes to top up the device, getting to the 50% mark in just 15 minutes. Nubia includes the charger in the box, and that's something I need to mention these days, because even Chinese brands are now starting to emulate Samsung and just have a cable bundled with the phone. <br><br>Connectivity wasn't an issue either, and I didn't see any problems in regular use or while making calls. On the whole, this is one of the best hardware packages you can get today, and Nubia nailed the basics.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-cameras"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S7u32rL4VyLmy7zVxTm38g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S7u32rL4VyLmy7zVxTm38g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Z70 Ultra comes with a 50MP Sony IMX906 main lens, and it goes from f/1.6 to f/4.0, providing decent flexibility in this regard. It's joined by a 64MP OmniVision OV64B telephoto with 2.7x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. There's a 16MP camera at the front, and while it doesn't have autofocus, it is invisible in daily use, and that's just plain cool. <br><br>The interface itself hasn't changed much, and you get the ability to easily switch between the lenses and shooting modes. There's 4K60 video with all the cameras at the back, but video quality just doesn't hold up to what Vivo and other Chinese brands are doing.</p>

<p>Shots taken in daylight have good colors and dynamic range, but there are times when the resultant photos had cooler colors than usual. The wide-angle lens also has these issues, and it tends to wash out colors at times — you don't get the same tonal balance as the main lens. The phone takes a smidgen longer to focus on a subject, but thankfully there's no shutter delay when you take an image. <br><br>Both cameras are decent at night, but again, they're nowhere at the same level as the Vivo X200 or Find X8. You get usable photos with good details, but they're not the best cameras — not by a long shot. The 64MP telephoto holds its own, thankfully, delivering detailed shots at 2.7x. What I like about the lens is that it doubles as a portrait shooter, and it does a good job in this area. <br><br>While it doesn't go toe-to-toe with the best Vivo and OPPO phones, the Z70 Ultra produces decent photos in any situation.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-software"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Software</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5hrjouSVBTo4xzUuawTABg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5hrjouSVBTo4xzUuawTABg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other manufacturer these days, Nubia is leaning heavily into AI with its software, and the result is a rebadged name: Nebula AIOS. That said, the interface is identical to last year's MyOS, and I don't really see any difference in the visual design or feature-set. <br><br>Dubiously, you don't get much in the way of AI-assisted features on the Z 70 Ultra; other than a real-time call translation service and smart signal boosting, there isn't anything that stands out. I don't mind this as most AI features are of questionable value anyway, but Nubia went to the effort of rebranding its software, so the least it should have done is add some features that leverage on-device machine learning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EUfznYnd5vXe5J3yv9SJ8g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EUfznYnd5vXe5J3yv9SJ8g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that though, I have no issues with the interface. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based UI is clean and doesn't have any overt styling, and Nubia deserves credit for not going overboard in this area (looking at you, Xiaomi). The fluidity is one of the best around, and it comes close to what ASUS manages on its own devices. While there's no such thing as a vanilla Android interface any longer — even Pixels have distinct styling — the Z70 Ultra manages to stand out for its clean UI. <br><br>However, Nubia is still aggressive with memory management, so background services routinely close, and I had issues with push notifications once again — they just wouldn't show up reliably. Overall though, it feels much better optimized than last year, and other than the issue with memory management, Nebula AIOS is great to use. <br><br>Nubia usually lags behind its Chinese rivals when it comes to updates, and that's no different this time. The Z70 Ultra is guaranteed to receive three Android OS updates alongside three years of security updates, and that's not on par with what you get with other brands. Considering that the Z60 Ultra is still on Android 14 with no mention of when the stable Android 15 build will roll out to the device, the Z70 Ultra isn't likely to switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> in a timely manner once the software version becomes available later this year.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h3>

<p>If you need a high-end phone that nails the basics, the OnePlus 13 is the ideal starting point. The device also has the same Qualcomm silicon, and it holds up well while gaming. You get much better cameras, and the design isn't anywhere as unwieldy — particularly with the unique leather-backed model. <br><br>Vivo's regular X200 is also a strong alternative. While it doesn't quite have the best overall cameras, it's a definite step up over what you get on the Z70 Ultra, and you're not limited by the hardware — it has the same internals as the X200 Pro. Availability is an issue as Vivo doesn't sell the device in the west, and Funtouch OS isn't quite as good at extended gaming.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a gaming phone that undercuts its rivals</li><li>You want an AMOLED panel that doesn't have any cutout</li><li>You need a clean UI without much bloatware</li><li>You want all the extras: IP68/IP69, AptX suite, and USB-C 3.2</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need feature-rich software and timely updates</li><li>You want the best cameras</li></ul>
<p>Ultimately, Nubia didn't change the narrative too much with the Z70 Ultra; the phone retains a familiar design and has a clear focus on delivering one of the best hardware packages. The all-screen panel is a huge advantage, and it makes using the phone that much more immersive and enjoyable. <br><br>Other than the fact that it doesn't last as long as the X200 Pro, I can't find anything to fault with the hardware; the Z70 Ultra is incredible at gaming and everyday tasks, and you get the latest Qualcomm silicon and meaningful gaming-focused features. While the software isn't quite as polished, I like that it has better optimization this time around, and the minimal styling makes it a decent alternative to bloated skins that are a mainstay with other Chinese brands. <br><br>The cameras are a sticking point; although the Z70 Ultra does a decent enough job in this area, the camera quality just doesn't measure up to the likes of the OnePlus 13, Vivo X200, and the Find X8, and the inconsistent nature of the images suggests Nubia still has a long way to go in this area. <br><br>If you need the best hardware and don't mind average cameras, the Z70 Ultra is a great choice — Nubia didn't leave anything out, and it is one of the fastest phones I used. But if you need a great overall package, you'll need to consider one of the Chinese alternatives.</p>

<p>Not to exaggerate, but I have seen bars of soap that are more physically attractive than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>. If you are as unaroused by the mundane design of the S25 series as I am, there's a little hack to switch things up. Dbrand's slick skins for the S25 lineup can give your Galaxy S25 a much-needed facelift almost instantly.</p><p>I always advocate for protective phone cases, but this is the one time I'll break my own rule. Not because you shouldn't use a phone case — you definitely should, especially if your fingers are as slippery as mine. Purely aesthetically speaking, however, a phone's skin looks far more appealing than a case.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, the curved edges of the S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-one-week-later">S25 Plus</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">S25 Ultra</a> are welcome changes that make it much more comfortable to hold the phones. The S25 devices aren't ugly, either. However, the trio looks nearly identical to last year's S24 lineup, and it's starting to get very stale.</p><p>Dbrand launched its Galaxy S25 skins even before the boring phone series itself. I have used the brand's skins before, as have many of my colleagues here at Android Central. We've all always loved the ease with which a Dbrand skin can be applied, their cost-effectiveness, and their high quality.</p><p>The instructions are simple enough to follow and very straightforward. All you need is a good head on your shoulders, a hairdryer to get the perfect application, and about 15 to 20 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>There are various sorts of Dbrand skins available for the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. You can choose from intriguing patterns, solid monochromes, and leather finishes. Dbrand gives you the leeway to jazz it up to your heart's content.</p><p>You could always choose plain black, but that would defeat the purpose of giving your device a makeover. Instead, I say opt for louder colors like the yellow Area 51 (Hazard) pattern or the glow-in-the-dark Glow Circuit skin.</p>

<p>Available in black, brown, and tan, the leather skin is especially fantastic. It has that grainy texture only genuine hide can produce and adds a ton of grip. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">his review</a>, Nick Sutrich described it as a "time-honored classic" that only gets better looking over time.</p><p>Unfortunately, beauty comes at a cost. The leather skins cost $34.95 as opposed to the $16.95 starting price of other basic skin designs. That's admittedly a lot for glorified "premium" stickers that don't do much in terms of drop protection for your Galaxy S25. You're paying purely for the looks, added grip, and maybe some basic scratch protection on select covered body parts of your phone. However, it could be well worth it to give your phone a classy look.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> is the most popular music streaming service on the planet, and it continued growing in 2024, per its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-02-04/spotify-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-earnings/" target="_blank">fourth-quarter financial results</a>. In a year that saw Spotify double-down on podcasts, video, and AI, all while not delivering on its lossless audio promise from 2024, the platform still grew its subscriber base by 11% year-over-year.</p><p>The company reported having 263 paid subscribers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">Spotify Premium</a> in the fourth quarter, which is an increase from 252 million in the third quarter. It's also above Spotify's internal expectations, which it attributed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-wrapped-2024-arrives">Spotify Wrapped</a> and other holiday marketing campaigns. Additionally, it says it edged out music streaming competitors in emerging markets, like Latin America and global markets.</p><p>Spotify's total monthly active users saw an uptick last year, too, reaching 675 million in 2024. That represents a 12% increase year-over-year, and is also 35 million more monthly active users than Spotify had as recently as Q3 2024. Again, the brand says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">Wrapped</a> and other campaigns helped the service grow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oddly, Spotify's press release and investor presentation shows off a lot of non-music features prominently, signaling that the service may be growing due to its extra-curriculars. These include Wrapped, which Spotify reports saw 10% higher engagement than last year, and its closely-related AI DJ experience.</p><p>Additionally, the company called out its push on the video podcast front and the Spotify Partner Program — a way for audio and video creators to earn on the platform, like competing platforms TikTok and YouTube offer.</p><p>Spotify didn't mention <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio">the state of its lossless audio project</a>, which was announced in 2021 and missed its target release window with few updates. Tidal and Apple Music have offered high-fidelity audio for year, eclipsing Spotify in this regard despite Spotify's market dominance.</p><p>The company expects its growth to continue in the first quarter of 2025, when it projects to add two million Premium subscribers.</p>

<ul><li>Alphabet sees a 12% revenue increase year-over-year in Q4 2024.</li><li>CEO Sundar Pichai says this was a strong quarter "driven by our leadership in AI and the momentum across the business."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced a 12% revenue increase <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q4-2023-earnings-report">year-over-year</a> to $96.47 billion in Q4 2024. The company's revenue at the end of its fiscal year totaled $350 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year.</p><p>The company's shares fell nearly 7% after the trading day Tuesday.</p><p>Operating income was $30.97 billion, up from $23.69 billion in the same period last year. Net income was reported at $26.53 billion, up from $20.68 billion in the same period from the previous year. <br><br>Google Service's revenues increased to $84.1 billion in the quarter, a 10% increase from the same period a year ago. The company said this is a reflection of "strong momentum across Google Search & other and YouTube ads."</p><p>The company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/a3/91/6d1950c148fa84c7d699abe05284/2024q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf" target="_blank">in the earnings statement</a> that the quarter was strong "driven by our leadership in AI and the momentum across the business."</p><p>"We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficients," he said.</p><p>"In Search, advances like AI Overviews and Circle to Search are increasing user engagement. Our AI-powered Google Cloud portfolio is seeing stronger customer demand, and YouTube continues to be the leader in streaming watchtime and podcasts."</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-google-parent-alphabet-stock-ahead-of-earnings-q4-fy-2024-8784161" target="_blank">Investopedia</a>, Bank of America analysts told clients that based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings#:~:text=Meta%20announced%20its%20Q4%202024,%244.9%20billion%20in%20operating%20costs." target="_blank">Meta's strong results last week</a> (where most of its plans were on AI spending), Alphabet also has positive momentum.</p><p>Analysts from BoA and Raymond James indicate that because of the boom of DeepSeek, Google may "push the tech giant to act with greater urgency on AI developments."</p><p>Pichai did not respond directly to the increase of interest in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> or its launch but addressed that Google has been working hard to push development on its AI.</p><p>"I think, you know, part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space, you know, it's as big as it comes. And that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment," he noted during the earnings call.</p><p>An email from Investing.com indicated the company saw a shortfall in its earnings "driven by slower Google Cloud growth," which highlights the "challenges of scaling its enterprise business amid fierce competition from Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure."</p><p>While the company has been pushing forward with AI investments, the drop in the market after hours "reflects investor disappointment."</p><p>"The street is demanding clearer timelines on when AI spending translates to earnings and sales growth, not just promises. The reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue. For Alphabet to reassure investors, it needs to demonstrate that its AI bets, from Gemini models to Workspace integrations, can reignite Cloud momentum while core advertising remains stable in an uncertain economy," the note read.</p><p>When asked how AI can be monetized in the future, Pichai indicated that the company has very good ideas for native ad concepts and will give people options over time, but that this year, Google will stay focused on the subscription direction.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung subtly indicated that it will not be providing monthly updates to its Galaxy S21 series.</li><li>Since the series was destined for 4 years of full software updates, it means One UI 7 is its last.</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 FE still makes the cut for monthly updates, given its later release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank"> Galaxy S25 series</a> recently launched with seven years worth of updates, which should begin with monthly security updates. However, anyone with the Galaxy S21 series will start noticing a slowdown in update cadence just four years after the phone's launch.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb" target="_blank">security updates post</a>, Samsung lays out the devices that will get monthly, quarterly, and bi-annual updates. As recently spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/samsung-galaxy-s21-monthly-updates-end/">9to5Google</a>, the S21 series will now be downgraded to quarterly updates.</p><p>Monthly, quarterly, and biannual firmware security updates include patches for Android OS-related security issues released by Google, as well as patches for Samsung-specific security issues.</p><p>This change in update cadence will impact the standard Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and Ultra models since they were. However, owners should note that the phones are still expected to receive the massive One UI 7 update, as they were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-now-offers-four-years-security-updates">promised four years of OS upgrades</a> after launching with Android 11. This will bring a revamped UI and perhaps additional Galaxy AI features in tandem with the latest flagship models. So, the S21 owners still have something to be excited about.</p><p>That said, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-moves-step-closer-launch"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe">Galaxy S21 FE</a> was launched later in 2021, so it will continue to receive monthly updates for now, along with all subsequent S series models, starting from S22 until the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>Some of the other devices still eligible for monthly security updates include the following models: Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G, Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G, Galaxy Z Fold 4, Galaxy Z Flip 4, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Flip 6, W23, W23 Flip, W24, W24 Flip, W25, W25 Flip, Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition and Enterprise Models starting with the Galaxy A53 5G.</p><p>Along with these phone-related updates, Samsung is releasing a security patch for its wearables as well, listed below:</p>
<ul><li>Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</li><li>Galaxy Watch 5, Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</li><li>Galaxy Watch 6, Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</li><li>Galaxy Watch FE</li><li>Galaxy Watch 7</li><li>Galaxy Watch Ultra</li></ul>
<p>As for the Galaxy S21, owners should continue to see updates last until sometime in early 2026, although it's unlikely it'll receive the next major Android release.</p>

It often seems to forget that people want to use Google Search and don't care about ads or AI or any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-update-brings-2-0-flash-experimental-model-and-google-home-photos-extensions-to-ios-app">other things Google loves to do</a>. Google became successful because it was so good at searching.</p><p>The company just sent out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-widget-customization-shortcut-option-spotted">tiny update to its Search widget</a>. It probably isn't the kind of update you're thinking of because it's not about shoving AI down your throat; it's a small change that actually improves the widget. It's been testing the update since last fall, and it seems like nothing is broken.</p>
<p>You can now set up a custom shortcut for your widget that adds a new icon to the bar and its associated behavior — unless you use a Pixel, of course, because that persistent bar on your screen hasn't changed even though these settings seem like they should be there, too.</p><p>Anyhoo, you can now set up the Search widget to translate text, translate via the camera, search for the name of a song, search the weather, search sports news, act as a dictionary, search finance and stock prices, and help with your homework. Oh, you can still use it as a way to search the web, too.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-google-search-widget" target="_blank">Finding the settings</a> is the most ridiculous Google thing ever — put the widget on your screen, tap the <strong>G</strong> icon, tap your profile picture in the upper right, choose <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Customize Search widget</strong>. Once you've done all that, you'll see a <strong>Shortcuts </strong>option. Tap it, and you'll find them.</p><p>It's like looking for pirate treasure, except it's actually there.</p>

<p>With many changes to the things your phone does and how it works, you'll find a lot of disgruntled people who hate them. That's why adding options instead of outright changing a behavior or feature is the better way. If you don't care about any of these custom shortcuts, you don't have to add one.</p><p>The real problem is that you probably didn't know they were there or had any idea how to get to the settings. Google needs to work on communicating with its users.</p><p>I might use the translate or song search shortcut once in a while, but this is less about what you or I might like and more about the way Google updated a core app the right way.

<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out an update for its enrolled testers experimenting with "Ask Photos" in the Photos app.</li><li>The "Ask" tab introduced in the beta no longer drops users into Gemini, instead, it offers suggestions and other photo/video options with the AI.</li><li>Google started its test of Ask Photos in September and its waitlist is still open for those interested.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems Google is rolling out an update for its AI-powered feature in Photos that makes it a little easier to manage.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/google-photos-gemini-search-ui/">9to5Google</a>, the app's "Ask Photos" feature, which leverages Gemini, is picking up a slight UI rework for its testers. Update 7.14 is changing the newly introduced "Ask" tab at the bottom of the app. Tapping it displays a completely reconfigured page that offers more options rather than tossing you directly into a chat with Gemini. Now, users will see a slightly reduced search bar and an "Ask" button beside it.</p><p>Beneath this is a change — or, rather, a reversion — to what testers reportedly experienced at the beginning: a panel of suggestions. The latest experimental version adds a list of suggested actions users can ask the AI to perform. It seems that these suggestions are based on content within your collections and albums in the Photos app.</p><p>Gemini's "Ask Photos" can dig into your screenshots or a specific timespan of photos you've taken. Additionally, the AI can go into your videos and favorites if you desire.</p><p>If users are interested in chatting with Gemini directly, tapping the button produces a slightly retuned chat. Users will now have a clean UI, minus their profile icon at the top right. Under the star, there are reportedly a few suggestions to help users get started. The "Try Asking" section gives users ideas about their photos and it also goes off on a tangent with "Write a funny poem about me."</p><p>These changes are reportedly rolling out to all users enrolled in the "Ask Photos" test in Photos in the U.S.</p>

<p>We've been expecting "Ask Photos" to drop ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini">Google teased it</a> during I/O 2024. Several months later, in September, the feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">finally arrived experimentally</a>, opening its waitlist for interested testers in the U.S. One of the headliners for this feature was Gemini's ability to "understand the context" of your photo gallery. This means that the AI should be able to recognize the people you're looking for, as well as food and other objects/items.</p><p>In the event that Gemini gets it wrong (which is possible), Google encourages users to add additional details to help it.</p><p>Aside from surfacing memories for you, Ask Photos can also create a collage of images for you from a recent trip or from whenever.</p><p>The waitlist for Ask Photos is still in testing, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/#ask-photos">its waitlist is still open</a> and ready to enter your email address.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is updating Galaxy Buds Manager control widgets ahead of One UI 7's widespread rollout.</li><li>The widget takes up more space on your home screen by default, and shows less information when collapsed.</li><li>While the update is already appearing for some, it might not be available immediately for your device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is tweaking the look of Galaxy Buds Manager widgets with an OTA update, and some users aren't happy. The design aligns with current One UI trends, but makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> control widgets bigger by default — and show fewer bits of information when manually collapsed.</p><p>The update is now rolling out as part of Galaxy Buds 3 Pro Manager v7.0 for some users, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-3-pro-widget-update-one-ui-7-design/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. While starting with the newest and highest-priced Buds 3 Pro, it's likely that this change is reflected across the full suite of Galaxy Buds Manager apps in the near future. The new widget has more rounded corners, taking an oval shape with a translucent look and an opacity that can still be customized.</p><p>The default widget is larger than the old one, and still shows the same amount of information. Unfortunately, the 4x1 and 2x1 sizes of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro control widget show less information, no longer providing the device name or full noise control slider. This was negatively received by some users of the One UI subreddit, as described by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1ihksku/new_buds_manager_widget_change_is_the_only/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1ihksku/new_buds_manager_widget_change_is_the_only">New Buds manager widget: Change is the only constant but this is just bs!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>There are some neat changes that come with the refreshed Galaxy Buds 3 Pro control widget. For starters, you can now choose between one of three options for background coloring: light, dark, and match phone setting. Previously, the options for white and black backgrounds were combined with an intensity slider. Now, there are separate toggles for background color and an opacity slider.</p><p>While the official Google Play Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.accessory.paranmgr" target="_blank">listing</a> shows the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro Manager app was recently updated, it may take a while for it to appear on your device. Android Central tested the change with Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> on One UI 7, as well as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> on One UI 6 — but the update was not available for either device yet. It also wasn't available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/04/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-one-ui-7-control-widget/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> over-the-air.</p><p>The reception to this change will almost certainly be mixed. It'll make the Galaxy Buds Manager control widgets blend in with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, but also arguably places form over function.</p>

<p>Google is kicking off February with multiple updates across its Pixels, Play Store, and Android systems.</p><p>To begin, Google posted its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/322457106/google-pixel-update-february-2025?hl=en&sjid=7989698189977629535-NC">patch notes</a> for the February 2024 security updates for its line of Pixel devices. This month's security patch will arrive for devices ranging from the Pixel 6 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> (including its Fold and Tablet) as version <strong>AP4A.250205.002</strong> globally.</p><p>This month's patch notes are relatively light. Google states its Pixel devices will fixes for "audio output in Android Auto under certain conditions." According to its changelog, this fix involves every eligible Pixel device for the February patch.</p><p>Additionally, the patch brings the following Bluetooth fix: "occasionally preventing connection with certain Bluetooth devices or accessories." Google says this was an issue primarily on the entire Pixel 9 series, meaning those users should now find relief.</p><p>Those with a Pixel device under T-Mobile will see vAP4A.250205.002.C1 for the Pixel 9 series. Pixel 7 devices up to the Pixel 9 under Telstra will find vAP4A.250205.002.B2 and the Pixel 6 series in EMEA will find vAP4A.250205.002.A1.</p><p>In other news, Google detailed its wave of early February updates on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">a support page</a>, which begins by highlighting a couple of updates for the Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/february-2025-google-system-updates/">9to5Google</a>). The changelog states there's an update rolling out for "Tablet pQuality" titled "version 3." Google says this patch "updates the system to evaluate the app quality on tablets and ChromeOS devices."</p><p>There are also a few UI updates on deck for the Play Store for users creating a Game Profile. These updates are reportedly arriving for Android phones as v44.8 of the Play Store.</p><p>Several updates are arriving for Play Services, which can be seen below.</p>
<ul><li>[Developers - Auto] New developer features for Google and third-party app developers to support machine learning and AI-related processes in their apps.</li><li>[Account Management - Phones] With the new entry point for Family Link in Google Settings, you can now manage your family group more easily.</li><li>[Utilities - Phones] New developer features for Google and third-party app developers to support utilities-related processes in their apps.</li><li>[Connectivity - Phone, TV, Wear OS, Auto] Bug fixes for device connection-related services.</li><li>[Connectivity - Phone] With this new feature, you can continue your Quick Share transfers over Wi-Fi or mobile data even if the sender or receiver loses direct connection.</li></ul>

<p>One important note to keep in mind is that this February security patch should tackle a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-zero-day-exploit-february-2024-detailed">crucial zero-day Android exploit</a>. The company recently detailed that the issue, marked as CVE-2024-53104, attacks the Android OS at its Linux kernel and gives the attacker free rein to harm your device, causing instability. Early on, there were reportedly "indications" of this being a real threat, thus the fix that's rolling in for February.</p><p>Google stated that the problem was "limited" and saw "targeted exploitation," but this is still something users should be aware of. Continue to check your Pixel device — and other Android devices as this plagues all — for the fix.</p>

<hr>
<p>Looks like one of China's exclusive flagship phones is making its way to India. Vivo's X200 Pro Mini is reportedly set for its launch outside home ground as early as Q2 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-vivo-x200-pro-mini-to-launch-in-india-by-q2-2025/">Smartprix</a>).</p><p>Prominent tipster Yogesh Brar took to X (previously Twitter) to talk about the X200 Pro Mini's arrival and said that the phone would cost close to 70,000 rupees, which is about $804. Considering the phone was already released in China in October last year, it is safe to say that we are more than aware of the specs this phone is said to come with.</p>

<p>The Vivo X200 Pro Mini is built with an aluminum alloy frame, weighing about 187g. When it comes to design, the Vivo X200 Pro Mini sports a 6.31" LTPO AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 1.5K resolution, and 4500 nits of peak brightness. It's not exactly "mini" but small enough to match other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">small Android phones</a> like the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>At the heart, it is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">MediaTek Dimensity 9400</a> chipset and comes equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.

The X200 Pro Mini comes with a triple camera setup with a 50MP main camera, a 50MP ultrawide lens, and a 50MP periscope telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom and 100x zoom.  On the front, it will get a 32MP ultrawide selfie camera capable of 4K video recording.</p>

<ul><li>Google is delivering a warning to Android users about a crucial zero-day exploit in the wild.</li><li>The issue can reportedly allow an attacker to cause widespread software instability and more if they've gained access to your phone.</li><li>Google has posted its February security patch notes, which includes a fix for the issue; however, OEMs are up next to deliver it to users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is warning Android users, including the Galaxy S25 and S24, of a critical Android software flaw.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/02/03/samsungs-android-update-bad-news-for-galaxy-s25-s24-owners/">Forbes</a>, Google has identified an issue within Android that could be under "targeted exploitation." Digging further, the publication states that this issue could let evil actors trigger memory instability, alter video frames, and more. The problem is reportedly labeled as CVE-2024-53104 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/02/03/google-warns-all-android-users-your-phone-is-now-at-risk/">another post</a> went into more detail.</p><p>This vulnerability was highlighted in Google's changelog for its monthly February <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-02-01">security patch</a>. The publication cites the company in saying the exploit "could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed." Additionally, this Android problem is attacking the OS at its Linux kernel, meaning it could widespread damage should an attacker gain access to your device.</p><p>While this is certainly dangerous, at the moment, the attacks are reportedly "limited" — but that doesn't mean you shouldn't update quickly once it's available.</p><p>The post highlights the Galaxy S25, considering its most recent One UI 7 patch only includes security updates up to December 2024. Samsung pushed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-january-2025-security-patch-is-rolling-out-for-a-long-list-of-galaxy-phones">January patch quite late</a> for the S24 series; however, that didn't involve this Android exploit.</p><p>As previously stated, this update plagues <em>every </em>Android device, so it's wise to update as soon as possible. With Google dropping the update, it's now sent to the respective OEMs to get it to users quickly.</p><p>Forbes adds that there's one more problematic bug involving devices with Qualcomm tech. This one appears to let attackers gain "remote access" to your device, but the publication says there aren't any victims yet. Nonetheless, a fix for that is likely soon.</p>

<p>Zero-day exploits (sadly) happen in the world of tech, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-chips-zero-day-targeted-android-confirmed">the issue Qualcomm ran into</a> in October. A few months ago, Qualcomm confirmed that there was a zero-day chip exploit running wild in the world of Android with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. The issues were "limited" and "targeted," so it refrained from causing widespread panic. The company was unsure of <em>who </em>the attacks were targeting; however, what was clear was that Google, Motorola, OnePlus, and others had devices involved.</p><p>The Google Threat Analysis Group provided "indications" that there was an issue running about user devices before passing it onto Qualcomm for confirmation. Aside from the SD 8 Gen 1, Qualcomm further concluded that the exploit affected 64 of its chips.</p><p>Luckily, the issue was patched a month before Qualcomm's official confirmation to the public.</p><p>Google was also busy in 2024 discussing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-report-zero-days-exploited-in-2023">97 zero-day vulnerabilities</a> that were exploited in 2023. It was a chunky rise of over 50% compared to 62 vulnerabilities from 2022. Most of those issues plagued Android phones, tablets, and operating systems.</p>

Plenty of others on the road don't offer that kind of luxury, and frankly, some aren't even that old. This was always the premise behind AAWireless as an adapter to bridge that gap. The AAWireless Two smooths out the rougher edges of the original and makes it easier to set up and use.</p><p>The main focus remains the same, which is to enable you to run wireless Android Auto where it's not possible. It's just that you can also share the connectivity with other drivers or passengers along the way.</p>

<p>AAWireless Two first launched in October 2024 and, unlike its predecessor, didn't come with a crowdfunding campaign.  The best places to find it are on Amazon and its own website, where it sells for $65. The only catch is availability, which fluctuates based on inventory from the European manufacturer. That's cheaper than the original AAWireless, which has basically been retired.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-what-s-good"><span>AAWireless Two: What's good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pGiKAoZEjw8dEEod2PvpXW" name="AAWireless-Two-in-hand" alt="AAWireless Two Android Auto adapter in hand and plugged in." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pGiKAoZEjw8dEEod2PvpXW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most obvious difference in this second iteration is that it's about half the size of the previous model. That puts it more in line with what other brands, especially those based in China, are bringing to market. These types of dongles and adapters keep getting smaller.</p><p>As they slim down in size, they're becoming easier to set up and manage. Mind you, the "manage" part is very relative because most others are simple "set it and forget it" types. Not so with the AAWireless Two, which encourages usability and customization however it can provide it.</p><p>Much of that comes from the button on the device, whose main function is to switch between paired phones or place the connection on "standby."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="Z3PTqMunemtSa5prViLMu6" name="AAWireless-Two-app-screenshots" alt="Screenshots of AAWireless app showing firmware update and button configurations." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3PTqMunemtSa5prViLMu6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AAWireless even lets you map the buttons within the limited parameters available. The point is that it makes it significantly easier to pair multiple devices and swap between them while on the road. Not only should it make road trips or commutes simpler, but it also allows drivers sharing the same car to utilize the wireless Android Auto connection. The one catch here is anyone connecting to this must use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. There's no Apple CarPlay here (except an AAWireless Two Plus model supporting it is coming in 2025).</p><p>The LED ring light is highly visible and easy to interpret, with solid blue confirming a phone is connected and running Android Auto. A single or double-click can switch over to another phone — a process that's impressively quick.</p><p>I liked it all the more because the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/aawireless-review">AAWireless</a> came with inconsistent connectivity, particularly on ignition. That smoothed over with subsequent firmware updates, but this sequel is already off to a good start. From the initial setup to connection stability, the Two delivers.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's also pretty seamless to pair a second phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's also pretty seamless to pair a second phone. All I had to do was press and hold the button until it flashed purple (indicating pairing mode) and then pair the second phone via the Bluetooth settings. Once done, the app lets you choose which device to prioritize first every time, or you can opt to have it first go to whichever phone it last connected with.</p><p>The process is sturdy throughout, and I found just pressing the button on the adapter was good enough to switch phones when necessary. It also proves super convenient with phone calls in case your partner or passenger needs to make a call and wants to use the car stereo as a speaker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WX5vEEuht377wyAkNjXffQ" name="AAWireless-Two-phone-app" alt="Holding an Android phone running the AAWireless app showing home screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WX5vEEuht377wyAkNjXffQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app's settings include a slew of extra features and controls, most of which you probably won't even need to consider.</p><p>One is "Audio stutter fix," a setting you'll want to toggle on if you encounter audio issues at any time while using the AAWireless Two. That said, Android Auto is supposed to set the buffer for audio playback to ensure it keeps playing without fail. If there's a problem, setting it to "Unlimited" should solve it.</p><p>AAWireless also brings back Passthrough as a means to play around with defaults, like adjusting the DPI (dots per inch) displayed and more. There are several other options in the settings in the app, but the disclaimer notes to "please make sure you know what you're doing" before trying them.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-what-s-not-good"><span>AAWireless Two: What's not good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6" name="AAWireless-Two-adapter-next-screen" alt="AAWireless Two adapter next to aftermarket infotainment head unit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first few times, the AAWireless Two connects took longer than usual. The delay eventually corrects itself as things are set up but it is a bit jarring if you're used to more immediate access to Android Auto like you get with a wired connection.</p><p>Naturally, a wired connection means you're also charging your phone at the same time. If your car has a wireless charging pad, you can take advantage of that anytime. It's still a good idea to keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-android-auto">charging cables</a> inside to charge the device whenever you need them.</p><p>Make sure to keep a USB-C-to-USB-C cable handy in case your car doesn't have USB-A ports. The included cable here is only a short USB-C-to-USB-A. There's also no adhesive pad included to keep the adapter upright on the dash — less of an issue with the previous one but more important here because of the phone-switching feature.</p><p>Then there's general availability. Unlike other similar adapters, the AAWireless Two is manufactured in Europe, so inventory tends to come in waves, meaning you'll have to catch one to get your hands on this device.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-competition"><span>AAWireless Two: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-close-up.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter close-up stuck to dash." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's hard to look at the AAWireless Two and not conclude it's the best of the bunch right now. Even more so given its predecessor occupied that spot before. Still, there are other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories">dongles and devices that can run wireless Android Auto</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/motorola-ma1-review">Motorola MA1</a> is recognizable by the name, but it's since been outshone by others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/carsifi-review" target="_blank">Carsifi</a> is a good example; only app updates are like UFO sightings, and they're never around. But at least it lets you pair more than one phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/automotive/carlinkit-5-review" target="_blank">Carlinkit 5.0</a> is solid except for the clunky firmware update process and poorly written manual. It does the job if you only care to go wireless and never really interact with it thereafter.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want wireless Android Auto in a vehicle with no other option but wired Android Auto</li><li>You share your car with at least one other Android user</li><li>You want app support for tweaks and troubleshooting</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are fine with plugging in to run Android Auto</li><li>You don't have a wireless charger</li><li>You use iPhone</li></ul>
<p>Whether you're new to going wireless or have done it many times running Android Auto, what's not to like about it? I've used the word "liberating" before in the same context, and it feels just like that with the AAWireless Two.</p><p>Possibly more so because of how it seamlessly involves another user without any snags. In that sense, going wireless is already a win, and switching that privilege over to another is a win-win.</p>

Ideal for jotting down notes, sketching, or even simply more comfortable navigation than using your finger, it’s a handy tool for both work and play.</p><p>Samsung’s S Pens are among the best styli you can buy, but what if you want to use multiple S Pens on your device? Maybe you have an old one lying around that you want to keep at home while your new one stays at the office. Or perhaps you want to swap among multiple S Pens as needs require or to ensure you always have one ready to go if the other’s battery is dead.</p><p>Whatever the case, the process is not quite as simple as just pairing a new S Pen to the device. There are specific settings you need to adjust to make things work smoothly.</p>

<p>The process is a little different when it comes to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold phones, which count among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a>.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is the latest premium phone in the company’s line-up. But when it comes to the S Pen, Samsung made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">controversial change to the S Pen</a> that comes with this device. It does not use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which means you can’t leverage Air Actions, even if you already own (or decide to buy) a Samsung S Pen Pro.</p><p>It is still <em>technically </em>possible to use multiple S Pens with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, the process to do so requires a few extra steps. You would need to first pair the S Pen Pro with another compatible Samsung Galaxy device, which means having one on hand. Both the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the other Galaxy device also need to be signed into the same Samsung account. Once you do this, you can use the S Pen Pro across multiple devices within your arsenal, like a Samsung Galaxy tablet and a phone.</p>

<p>The great thing about the Samsung S Pen is that it works wonderfully with Samsung Galaxy devices. But there are several different models, some specific to a certain device, like the Fold edition. Some Galaxy devices come with an S Pen and in these cases, you’re best to use the S Pen that comes with it. But if there’s a viable reason you want to use other S Pens, there is a workaround in most cases. Follow the steps above, noting the limitations, and you should be off to the races.</p>

Mark Rabkin, who has had the title of VP of VR/MR since the Oculus Quest 2 launched in 2020, is passing the baton on to Ryan Cairns, who formerly led on Portal and Meta for Work initiatives. Cairns is expected to assume the full title of VP of VR/MR at the beginning of March and will report to Vishal Shah, who will remain VP of Metaverse.</p><p>In a letter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/mrabkin/posts/pfbid02UZ2ivLB5d1fXnGhckaTyy3jzYB5AsR9m65QNEFfeeDkGPaLDFbGoQgPVhMH771Vzl">shared on Facebook</a>, Rabkin describes his nearly two decades time at Meta as a "foundational, formative experience." Rabkin cites that his main reason for leaving is because of family health struggles at home, noting that he'll be taking some time off work rather than just moving to a different position inside the company.</p><p>Rabkin has helped shape the ecosystem that drives Meta Quest headsets over the past six years, including the transition from Oculus to Meta branding, steering the division to record revenues of over 1 billion dollars last quarter alone. He also shaped the transformation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta Horizon OS</a> from an Oculus-branded product to one that third parties will soon be using. At Meta Connect 2024, he was a big proponent of the recently launched Meta Quest 3S which is part of a 40% sales increase according to a leaked memo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reality-labs-sales-grew-40-in-2024-leaked-memo/">UploadVR</a>).</p><p>But Rabkin was also behind a controversial change last Fall to the Meta Horizon Store — the digital marketplace where Meta Quest users can purchase and download games and apps — which saw app curation replaced with what developers have described as "utter chaos." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">A bad update</a> this past Christmas also left many customers with a poor first impression of Meta Quest headsets. We expect some big changes as Ryan Cairns heads into the new position, starting with the Meta Horizon store.</p>
<h2 id="big-changes-on-the-horizon-2">Big changes on the Horizon</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bCwDwsXy9wxPf4ecwDjVrP" name="Meta-Quest-3S-Yoges-Elite-Strap-01" alt="The Yoges Y14 Elite Strap with battery on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCwDwsXy9wxPf4ecwDjVrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Horizon ecosystem has seen massive changes over the past year and we expect Shah's promotion to usher in even more. Since the Meta Horizon OS announcement last April, we've seen the Meta Quest app change names to Meta Horizon and get a huge facelift, Meta's Horizon metaverse (we're confused too) become a prominent promotional part of the Meta Quest, and the app store's curation model get completely removed.</p><p>The previous content curation headed by Meta's Director of Games, Chris Pruett, was axed in favor of a more "open" ecosystem last Summer. Previously, apps and games only appeared on the main Meta store if Meta approved them. This model created problems because Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-user-reviews">lack of transparency</a> meant developers rarely understood why their apps or games were approved or rejected. Meta often relegated unapproved games to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/quest-app-lab-more-doubles-official-store-almost-850-apps-within-year">App Lab</a>, making them difficult to find and monetize.</p><p>Pruett came under fire several times because his own development studio, Robot Invader, had no problem getting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/dead-secret-circle/">Dead Secret</a> series of games approved on the store more than once. After years of complaints from developers, Meta abandoned its content curation methods in favor of a wild west approach, spearheaded by Rabkin and paraded heavily at Meta Connect 2024.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Horizon store went from heavy curation under lock and key to the wild west in a few short months, and developers aren't happy about the whiplash.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Developer and customer response to the change has been less than positive. Over the past few months, I've spoken with several developers who feel their game has "been buried" on the Quest store by dozens of Gorilla Tag clones that flood the store every day. Meta has also heavily promoted its Meta Horizon "metaverse" app, which is built into every Quest headset, over other paid apps and games on the store.</p><p>It has left a bad taste in some developers' mouths and customers aren't happy with the new curation options, either. Over the past few months, I've seen many people on social media ask why they're being served Horizon Worlds content instead of big-name games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/behemoth-hands-on">Behemoth</a>, and Alien Rogue Incursion.</p><p>But if you think this era of Meta Horizon store curation is about to end, think again.</p>

<p>Mark Rabkin's successor, Ryan Cairns, will report to Vishal Shah, the man who has been in charge of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">the Metaverse</a> since Mark Zuckerberg introduced the concept in August 2021. The grandiose presentation was always underscored with an "eventually" clause and the company was ridiculed for years because Zuckerberg's vision is proving to be a difficult task to achieve.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/boztank/3560193565323649208/">most recent Instagram AMA</a>, Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth answered a question directed at the future of Horizon Worlds and the Metaverse the company has been trying to build. Boz admitted that "I think we had to get a lot of a lot more pieces in place than we thought when we started," in relation to executing on the vision of the Metaverse and, more specifically, the successful rollout of Horizon Worlds.</p><p>Boz went on to say that the metaverse concept as a whole is already alive and well among gamers. "People are already having very Metaverse experiences in Fortnite, in Roblox, in all these other platforms." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-next-generation-is-already-living-in-the-metaverse">I also wrote about this</a> before Fortnite started calling itself a metaverse platform, and now Meta has to push hard to get Horizon Worlds to be even a fraction as popular as Roblox or Fortnite currently are.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It is about filling our products with "Give A Damn". This is about having pride in our work.</p><figcaption><cite>Andrew Bosworth, CTO of Meta</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>That push all starts with <em>mobile</em>, not VR or MR. In a memo leaked to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2?ref=uploadvr.com">Business Insider</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-cto-to-staff-leaked-memo-2025-year-of-greatness/">UploadVR</a>), Boz outlined that 2025 "likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure." It's a fiery line that echoes what Mark Zuckerberg just said in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">Meta's latest earnings report</a> when he touted that 2025 would be a "pivotal year for the metaverse."</p><p>Boz's memo touched on the importance of small teams pulling off "operational excellence and master craftsmanship," almost certainly alluding to the botched rollout of an update that bricked Meta Quest headsets over Christmas break and caused Meta to have to replace them for free.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If I can expect anything for the Meta Quest in 2025, it's the launch of lots of new, big ideas and the decoupling of the idea that the metaverse has to somehow be experienced solely in VR.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>"It is about filling our products with 'Give A Damn'. This is about having pride in our work." The "give a damn" quote is a reference to the shocking letter the previous CTO, John Carmack, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0iPixEvPJQGzNa6t2x6HUL5TYqfmKGqSgfkBg6QaTyHF5frXQi7eLGxC7uPQv5U5jl&id=100006735798590&mibextid=qC1gEa&_rdr">posted on social media</a> when he resigned in December 2022. The company didn't care enough about its products back then, urged Carmack, and it seems that Boz is noticing that enough hasn't changed in the two years since then.</p><p>Does this mean we'll see a leaner Meta Quest development team that is quicker to respond to criticism? Almost certainly, yes. But it also means that Meta will be, undoubtedly, pushing its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform just as hard or even harder than it did in 2024.</p><p>After all, what use it is in putting the man in charge of the Metaverse in charge of <em>everything</em> VR and MR if the fulfillment of a long-term vision isn't in sight? If I can expect anything for the Meta Quest in 2025, it's the launch of lots of new, big ideas and the decoupling of the idea that the metaverse has to somehow be experienced solely in VR.</p>
<p><em>Correction: The original article stated that Vishal Shah would replace Mark Rabkin. However, Android Central later learned that Ryan Cairns will take Rabkin's title and will report to Vishal Shah, the current VP of Metaverse.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-82">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>OpenAI just launched Deep Research for ChatGPT, a fast AI tool that cranks out detailed research reports in minutes instead of hours.</li><li>Deep Research mimics a human analyst, scouring and blending online sources for well-rounded reports.</li><li>It’s available for ChatGPT Pro users at $200 a month, with a limit of 100 queries per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OpenAI has unveiled a new AI agent for ChatGPT that cranks out detailed research reports in no time. Think of it as your fast pass to pro-level insights, removing the need to wait around for ages to get the info you need.</p><p>OpenAI’s Deep Research is designed to take on tough research tasks by diving into multi-step investigations across the web. It slashes the time needed for deep research, pulling off in minutes what used to take hours of manual work (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/openai-chatgpt-deep-research-3522437/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Mimicking the careful process of a human analyst, it scours, sorts, and blends tons of online sources to spit out detailed, well-rounded reports, according to OpenAI's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p><p>Once you give Deep Research a solid prompt and iron out a few quick details, it gets to work on its own, crunching data behind the scenes. While it might take anywhere from five to 30 minutes to finish, OpenAI says this smart system can smash through hours of human research in just a fraction of the time.</p><p>With rivals, especially Chinese companies like DeepSeek, heating up the race, OpenAI’s launch of Deep Research is a big leap forward in building smarter, more independent AI tools.</p><p>Built on OpenAI’s upcoming o3 model, Deep Research is designed for professionals who need solid, in-depth insights. Whether you're in finance, science, policy, or engineering, this tool helps tackle heavy research with accuracy and reliability.</p><p>This AI agent works on its own, mapping out and executing multi-step research while staying flexible enough to backtrack and adapt to real-time info when needed.</p><p>Rather than solely producing text, this AI lays out its whole research process in a sidebar—citations, methodology, and all—so you see exactly how it got there.</p><p>Deep Research looks ready to shake up knowledge work, bringing big benefits to its users. The features it offers seem pretty similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>'s Deep Research too.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">rolled out its own version last year for subscribers</a>, aiming to cut research time down to minutes instead of hours. OpenAI's Deep Research seems to be chasing the same goal.</p><p>Deep Research is currently available on the web for ChatGPT Pro subscribers, costing $200 a month, with a cap of 100 queries per month.</p>

<p>Samsung's latest plus-sized flagship is here, and the Galaxy S25 Plus stacks up nicely with the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Of course, the comparisons between Pixel and Galaxy phones aren't always equal. While both the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 lineups each include three models, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is comparable to both the midsize Galaxy S25 Plus and the top-tier Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>At $999, the 6.7-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a> is a tough competitor for the $1,099 6.8-inch Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is the reigning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phone</a>. The Galaxy S25 Plus has the better processor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> has the better camera, and both have excellent software.</p><p>So, which one should you buy? That's what this comparison will help you find out, so let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-display-home-screen-01" alt="Comparing the display and home screens of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's only a tenth of an inch separating the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Pixel 9 Pro XL in terms of screen sizes, but you wouldn't know it from their overall form factor. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is thinner, lighter, and more compact than the Pixel 9 Pro XL — and significantly so. For instance, the former weighs just 190 grams, while the latter weighs 221 grams. The Pixel is also more than a full millimeter thicker than the Galaxy.</p><p>Put simply, you will notice and feel the size difference between these two phones. If you prefer a more compact handset, you'll like the Galaxy S25 Plus, which measures 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm. Those who like the hefty and large feel of a premium flagship might prefer the Pixel 9 Pro XL, measuring 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm.</p><p>Both designs follow industry trends, now preferring largely rectangular chassis with slight chamfers rather than curvy shells. Both phones also feature matte back glass finishes, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL has polished sides while the Galaxy S25 Plus has matte aluminum rails.</p>

<p>From the back, the iconic Pixel camera housing is hard to miss on the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's pill-shaped and is kind of a dust and lint magnet, especially if you use your phone caseless. The rear lenses on the Galaxy S25 Plus are separate and now feature DSLR-style lens covers that differentiate it and older models.</p><p>In terms of the display, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the larger 6.8-inch AMOLED panel. It's equipped with 120Hz support and variable refresh rate capabilities, just like the Galaxy S25 Plus. The Galaxy S25 Plus is smaller, with a 6.7-inch AMOLED, and includes a ProScaler that uses software to make the Galaxy's display look sharper. Both phones are covered by Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on top of their screens.</p>

<p>There are advantages to both the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Pixel 9 Pro XL's respective approaches to hardware. Samsung went with raw power in the Galaxy S25 Plus, since it's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset and paired with 12GB of RAM. The collaborative chip between Samsung and Qualcomm is the most powerful Android processor to date, beating even the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite platform.</p><p>Regardless of which benchmark you pick, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9 Pro XL will lose to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. However, Google is optimizing everything in the Pixel 9 Pro XL, from the silicon to the display and software. That gives it an edge in efficiency. Unfortunately, Google lost its lead in AI processing — the Tensor G4 chip can only handle 45 tokens per second for AI tasks, while the Snapdragon 8 Elite can do 70 tokens per second.</p><p>Both phones are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based, and both come with a promise of seven years of OS upgrades. Samsung uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which is unique but is more similar to Google's build of Android than ever. Pixel Launcher is truly Google's vision for Android, and it lacks some of Samsung's unnecessary bloat.</p>

<p>Samsung and Google both upgraded the connectivity offerings on their newest flagships. Both are equipped with Wi-Fi 7, mmWave 5G, NFC, and UWB support. The Galaxy S25 Plus has the edge in Bluetooth connectivity, with 5.4 as opposed to 5.3 for the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tYC9X6Lo2GHhMqWT4oUQnV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-back-corners-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the camera islands of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tYC9X6Lo2GHhMqWT4oUQnV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It feels like the same story every year for Galaxy flagships: the camera system is holding the Galaxy S25 Plus back. It uses the same sensors as the Galaxy S24 Plus, Galaxy S23 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Plus. The lack of upgrades here is astounding, and it only helps the Pixel 9 Pro XL's case. To recap, the Galaxy S25 Plus includes the following sensors: a 50MP main, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide.</p><p>Basically, all Google had to do over the last few years of Pixel development is keep making upgrades, and it has. The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a great camera system with a 50MP main shooter and dual 48MP secondary cameras. There's a 48MP ultrawide and another 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom support. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a better fit to compete with the Galaxy S25 Ultra than the Galaxy S25 Plus, despite it only costing $100 more than the latter.</p><p>Google wins the front camera battle, too, since the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 48MP front-facing, hole-punch sensor. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Plus has a 12MP front sensor.</p>

<p>This is a rare case of two phones that both have excellent value propositions, each for a different type of smartphone user. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is thinner, lighter, and more compact than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, so it's ideal for those who want a small phone without sacrificing too many features. The camera system could be better, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is standout.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a superior camera system with excellent computational photography. The phone's 6.8-inch screen may be the perfect middle ground between the Galaxy S25 Plus and the massive Galaxy S25 Ultra. Of course, it has Google AI at the core and the Pixel Launcher, so the software is excellent.</p><p>All told, you can't really go wrong with either of these phones. However, considering how similar the Galaxy S25 Plus is to the Galaxy S24 Plus, you may want to check if the predecessor could give you what you're looking for on a budget. We have that comparison for you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-galaxy-s24-plus">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Pixel phones, along with other Android phones, have incorporated a Wi-Fi calling feature for over a couple of years now. It works in conjunction with the device's carrier to ensure users have a smoother calling experience. Pixel phones, however, may soon remind users to enable the feature if it is not enabled already.</p><p>The feature was spotted in an APK teardown performed by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phones-remind-wi-fi-calling-apk-teardown-3521529/">Android Authority</a> for the Adaptive Connectivity Services app bearing version <strong>p.2025.01</strong>. Based on identified strings in the app's backend, Google could soon notify Pixel owners to enable Wi-Fi calling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="g2p3qwKfPnzfPZKFZVCKf" name="pixel-3a-wifi-calling.jpg" alt="Wi-Fi calling on an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2p3qwKfPnzfPZKFZVCKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The notification description further reads, "Turn on Wi-Fi calling to talk and text in places where the mobile network isn't as strong." The publication further notes that it is still unclear whether Google would send users the notification only when Wi-Fi calling is disabled or when it detects that the user is in a poor or no network area. Either way, users will soon see a "turn on" pop-up with the new notification and also can "dismiss" it.</p><p>Users who are new to Pixel phones and not so tech-savvy might find the new notification quite useful. However, not all Pixel phones in all regions support the Wi-Fi calling feature, since it is highly dependent on the respective carriers and Google itself; that's one thing to keep in mind.</p><p>If you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> series phone or any other Pixel phone that supports the Wi-Fi calling feature, it could soon come to your handset via the aforementioned app update, which could be in a couple of weeks or months, as it still appears to be in the testing phase. We recommend you stay up to date with the Adaptive Connectivity Services app version to notice the new, nifty notification feature.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It's easy to think that the best phones in 2025 are growing stale. The product category has matured over the past two decades, and many updates are incremental. For instance, the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 lineup</a> with a few tweaks. Similar things can be said about the latest iPhones and newest Pixels, to a lesser degree.</p><p>In fact, Android Central's resident phone expert, Nicholas Sutrich, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/north-american-smartphone-market-2025-predictions-expectations" target="_blank">previewed the market for smartphones in 2025</a> at the end of last year with an outlook that could be described as depressing. He's right. For most phone buyers in North America, this year will be just like the last one — filled with incremental updates, rising prices, and little variety.</p>

<p>Here's the thing: it doesn't have to be this way. Smartphone buyers in the U.S. specifically silo themselves when buying their handsets, often sticking to a handful of mobile carriers and even fewer phone brands. It's a phenomenon that seems to only exist in North America.</p><p>Put simply, buying smartphones through carrier contracts is a bad idea. It limits your options, restricts your flexibility, and can end up costing you more in the long run. It's easy to see how.</p><p>Samsung routinely offers boosted trade-in values for phones, but you can't take advantage of them unless your phone is paid off. Want to pay your phone off early to maximize your trade-in value? You'll likely lose all the discounts and promotions you got when you bought your current phone from your carrier.</p><p>A similar situation occurs if you break your phone and don't have insurance. Say your phone is too damaged to fix and you need a new one — you could be hit with a massive bill that includes the amount needed to pay off your current phone, plus the price of a new one and any carrier fees that apply.</p><p>Those are just a few reasons that you might want to consider buying a phone outright in 2025 rather than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-phone-carrier">purchasing it from a mobile network provider</a> — like AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon. But there are other reasons, like the availability of more phone brands and models beyond what you see in your carrier stores. Based on what I've seen from the phone market in late 2024 and early 2025, there are lots of exciting and fun smartphones available if you look beyond the restrictions imposed by carriers.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R are two great phones to start with because they're sensible options. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a $900 phone with hardware that can match or beat the $1,299 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which is pretty exciting to me. On top of that, the phone has IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 protection</a> against dust and water ingress. In other words, you can stick the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher, and it should survive (though we don't recommend you try it).</p><p>The OnePlus 13 isn't the only phone in 2025 that can survive a dishwasher run. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> is dishwasher-safe as well, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">I saw it used as a cutting board, too</a>. If that isn't fun, I honestly don't know what is.</p><p>Back to the <em>sensible</em> nature of this section, it's hard to forget the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. It delivers flagship specs for $600, and that's downright cool. I think there are many people in North America that have been conditioned by Apple and Samsung to think that flagships have to cost $1,000 or above. In 2025, that couldn't be more wrong. There has never been a time when $500 or $600 could get you more in a smartphone.</p><p>As a phone reviewer, I often test out a variety of review units each year. But I also buy way too many phones and other gadgets with my own money, and I've never been more conflicted about which one to buy. The OnePlus 13 is the sensible option, like I said, although there are many others that fit the "fun" bill better.</p>

<p>One of those devices is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-is-the-best-gaming-phone-and-its-here-in-the-us">came to the U.S. in January</a> and is simply a beastly and unique gaming phone. The ROG Phone 9 Pro has a loud design with nods to ASUS' gaming aesthetic, but things really get crazy with "Anime Vision." That's what ASUS calls the LED display on the back of ROG Phone 9 Pro, which includes 648 individual white and red LEDs.</p><p>You can put logos, text, and other designs on the back of your smartphone with the ROG Phone 9 Pro. If you're not impressed yet, the ROG Phone 9 Pro's back LED display can actually be used to play retro-style mini-games and show your phone's battery percentage. From a hardware perspective, the ROG Phone 9 Pro has a 3.5mm headphone jack and <em>two</em> USB-C ports designed to connect to accessories like controllers or a cooling fan.</p><p>Seriously, anyone who thinks phones aren't fun nowadays isn't looking hard enough. The ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro is one of the most fun devices I've ever seen, and I might pay over $1,000 just to get my hands on one.</p>

<p>Finally, I think it's worth emphasizing how much flair and customization can be added to phones, especially those sold outside the U.S. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-spark-30-bumblebee-edition-hands-on">TECNO Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition</a> is designed like a Transformer, which is insanely cool for robot nerds like myself. If superheroes are more your style, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">Poco X7 Pro Iron Man edition</a>, which needs no introduction.</p><p>No matter what kind of smartphone buyer you are, there's a "fun" device for you in 2025. Like a super durable smartphone? The OnePlus 13 is right for you. Need a flagship on a budget? Don't count out the OnePlus 13R. Want a phone so cool it gets into ludicrous hardware territory? That's the ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro, plain and simple. Want to express your fandoms without a case or skin? The Bumblebee or Iron Man phones are insanely neat.</p><p>It's true that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> from brands like Samsung or Google can get boring. However, it would be a mistake to limit yourself to those companies or to whatever your cellular carrier offers. There's a whole lot of phones out there, and they're more fun than ever.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's latest Ultra device comes to Zack Nelson's table for a durability test.</li><li>The test revealed that Samsung passed the test with a stronger build and better screen than before.</li><li>It also showcases that the device's new camera rings are incorporated for aesthetic purposes.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series will likely be delivered to users starting February 3 for those who've pre-ordered. This means more reviews are likely to surface about the trio, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. While we await, JerryRigEverything's durability test is now out, showcasing the build and some cons of the Ultra handset.</p><p>YouTuber Zack Nelson begins his latest durability test video by discussing how companies like Apple and Samsung are sticking to the Titanium builds that their phones have incorporated over the past couple of years; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> features the same and looks better than before.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kN9YYURZD5Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Later in the video, when the handset is compared to its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>, it is evident how familiar both flagships look, except for the slightly rounded corners that the Galaxy S25 Ultra features.</p><p>Nelson further examines the new S-Pen, now downgraded with the removal of low-power Bluetooth functionality — used for gestures and its button, which was previously utilized as a click button to take photos with the handset's cameras.</p><p>Since the S-Pen doesn't require an inbuilt battery with the omission of the aforementioned features, it still has a battery slot, which can be seen in the video as Nelson snaps it into pieces.</p>
<p>Turning to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's screen, the Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2 protection adequately protects it from scratches, as the most visible ones are seen in level 7 of Nelson's scratch test.</p><p>Moving to the controversial aspect of the device, its camera rings are fixed with some kind of glue on top of the lenses, which is visible in the durability test video. Nelson manages to remove the metal rings, which appear to serve only aesthetic purposes for the Galaxy S25 Ultra's design.</p><p>Additionally, those rings are slightly elevated on the rear panel, which means they can easily accumulate dust underneath, and cleaning them often would be a nightmare. Lastly, the popular bend test has also been performed by Nelson; the S25 Ultra seems to have passed the test with flying colors.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the weekend, we learned that Apple reportedly canceled plans to make a pair of AR glasses that would operate by connecting to a Mac computer. The glasses were seen as a sort of "Apple Vision Lite," as they were powered by the same operating system inside the expensive Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/apple-scraps-work-on-mac-connected-augmented-reality-glasses">Bloomberg</a>'s original report noted that executives weren't impressed with the product, citing performance issues and ever-changing feature requests. These glasses originally required pairing to an iPhone, but that was later changed to a Mac as they drained the phone's battery too fast and required too much processing power for a phone.</p><p>The news comes on the one-year anniversary of the Apple Vision Pro, a product that has been met with waning consumer interest given the extremely high $3,500 price tag. Given Apple's woes with XR products — XR is the umbrella term for anything AR, VR, and beyond — critics are saying that this is yet another death knell for the category as a whole. As usual, though, they couldn't be more wrong.</p>

<p>I'm writing this article from my laptop while wearing a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">Xreal One</a> glasses. I'm not using my laptop's display because I'm at my kitchen table, a place that's not ergonomically designed to work from. Unless I want severe neck pain by the end of the day, wearing my Xreal One glasses and working from a giant virtual screen is the best preventative medicine.</p><p>Apple realized this was the best possible scenario for a smart display glasses product after its initial R&D attempts on a phone. I don't buy for a minute that a phone "wasn't powerful enough" to run this experience. Today's smartphones are powered by what are essentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">laptop-grade processors</a>. Maybe the phone's battery life was an issue, but even that seems questionable.</p><p>Rather, I think Apple understood that having a phone in your hand connected to a pair of smart display glasses simply doesn't make any sense. There are very few scenarios I can think of where connecting smart glasses to a phone is an ideal experience. Gaming and watching videos are brilliant when viewing from a pair of smart glasses, and your neck and back will thank you for not holding a phone up for hours.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ku2fbtdqn3a44ENUri6gyT" name="xreal-one-vs-xreal-air-2-side" alt="Xreal Air 2 (left) vs Xreal One (right) from a side perspective" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku2fbtdqn3a44ENUri6gyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also think the company struggled to differentiate these glasses from existing products. It's possible that they were sleeker than existing smart display glasses, but is that enough, especially given that a Mac was a requirement for use? Probably not.</p><p>Even many of Apple's described glasses features sounded similar to existing Xreal One and Viture Pro glasses. They reportedly didn't have the EyeSight feature from Vision Pro — that's the outer display that shows your eyes to people in the room — but the glasses were said to have an electrochromic film on the glasses that could change the tint to show your actual eyes or cover them up to let others around you know that you're busy.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Apple likely struggled to differentiate this product from the pack without significant technological hurdles.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The question is why Apple didn't feel content with shipping a high-quality wearable display, which is how current smart display glasses could be described. The Xreal One glasses I'm wearing right now are the first pair Xreal has shipped with custom silicon inside, but even still, the company isn't trying to sell these as competition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons to wear an Apple Vision Pro is to have a studio-quality set of virtual monitors no matter where you're working from, and I'm genuinely surprised Apple didn't try to just replicate this one proven feature in a smart glasses form factor.</p><p>Without Apple coming forward and saying it, I think the glasses didn't deliver a wide enough field of view (FoV) to properly replicate the Vision Pro's virtual monitor experience. Xreal One currently sports the widest FoV of any smart display glasses at 50 degrees. Xreal One Pro ups this to 57 degrees and is slated to launch soon. Both of these are notably wider than the closest competition but still fall short of Meta Orion's 70-degree FoV and Vision Pro's 90 degrees.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Existing smart display glasses have become increasingly excellent, and it's surprising Apple didn't at least go for the "premium wearable display" angle.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>What's particularly interesting to me here is that Apple was apparently trying to run Vision OS on these glasses. If they required a Mac to function, I'm not entirely sure what Apple was trying to do by including a full-fledged OS on a pair of tethered glasses.</p><p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> operating system is being used to power headsets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung Project Moohan,</a> as well as smart glasses from Xreal, Magic Leap, and potentially other companies. That means both Vision OS and Android XR are capable of being scaled to very different types of products, but neither company has shown off exactly what this means.</p><p>Apple absolutely should try to at least ship a pair of glasses that function as a wearable display, if for no other reason than to save its users' necks while they travel or are away from their desks. Until then, pick up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4">Viture Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Renowned-Adjustable-Transparency/dp/B0DNFFXG65/">Xreal One</a> glasses from Amazon. Your neck will thank you.</p>

<hr>
<p>A tech-savvy user pulled off something pretty wild—they got Grand Theft Auto and God of War running on a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5.</p><p>A Redditor named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1i2b8l5/this_is_just_a_regular_smartwatch_no/" target="_blank">ZenonDesingk</a> managed to get God of War, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and even Forza Horizon 4 (streamed through Steam Link) running on their Galaxy Watch 5. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/this-redditor-installed-a-psp-emulator-on-a-galaxy-watch-5-now-it-runs-gta-at-60fps-and-god-of-war" target="_blank">TechRadar</a> spotted the post and decided to dive into the subreddit to figure out how they made it happen.</p><p>ZenonDesingk shared that they bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> after being impressed by a friend’s device. But when they checked out the available games, they were pretty let down. Still, the user didn’t give up. That open-ended flexibility became their driving force to push the watch’s limits.</p><p>However, when the usual methods of sideloading APKs—like Bluetooth or browser installs—didn’t work, ZenonDesingk had to step up. They turned to ADB and the Bugjaeger app, using Wi-Fi to transfer the needed APK files from their phone to the smartwatch.</p><p>Once the PSP emulator was installed and the DPI settings were fine-tuned, they brought some serious gaming action to the Galaxy Watch 5. Classics like GTA, Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed: Most Wanted ran buttery smooth at around 60 FPS, while heavier titles like God of War still managed a solid 30 FPS.</p>

<p>Even though the Galaxy Watch 5 is a three-year-old device and not exactly the latest tech, it’s still holding its own—running emulated PSP games at a smooth 60 FPS. It’s a solid reminder of how capable its hardware still is, even by today’s standards.</p><p>Knowing touchscreen controls could only go so far, ZenonDesingk hooked up a Bluetooth gamepad to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, making gameplay way more comfortable and accurate. With that hurdle out of the way, the only real limit left was the watch’s performance. And thanks to a bunch of emulators and the option to sideload Android games, the little smartwatch suddenly became a surprisingly versatile gaming machine.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung might finally let you take charge of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>'s annoying screen dimming feature that kicks in when it hits 5% battery. Word is, the upcoming One UI 7 update could give you the option to turn it off.</p><p>Currently, One UI goes full-on power-saving mode when your battery hits 5%, slashing your screen brightness to the point where it’s almost impossible to see, even in decent lighting.</p><p>Sure, dialing down screen brightness can help squeeze more juice out of your battery, but it really should be up to you, not your phone. Right now, Galaxy devices take matters into their own hands, automatically dimming the screen when the battery is running on fumes. Sure, you can crank the brightness back up, but having your phone override your settings like that is super annoying.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-7-auto-dim-screen-low-battery-feature/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the new One UI 7 beta address this annoyance. This means you're getting the choice to stop your screen from going dim when your battery hits 5%.</p><p>In the Battery settings, there’s a fresh toggle called "Auto dim screen" that lets you turn off the automatic brightness drop.</p>

<p>This update might seem like a small change, but it’s actually pretty meaningful. For starters, it’s all about giving users more control over how their phone works. Letting people customize their device’s behavior is a win, and Samsung deserves some credit for finally giving Galaxy owners the option to ditch that auto-dimming hassle.</p><p>Sure, automatically dimming the screen to save battery makes sense, but it can also make your phone way harder to use when you need it most. Letting users decide how to handle that trade-off is a smart move.</p><p>One UI 7 is officially out for the Galaxy S25 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">in beta for the S24 series</a>.

<hr>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is fed up with Meta employees spilling the tea from internal meetings. The company sent out a memo warning that leaking info could cost them their job. But, in a classic twist, the memo itself got leaked almost immediately.</p><p>Meta’s CISO, Guy Rosen, sent out a memo doubling down on the company’s no-leak policy. The message was clear: if you’re caught sharing internal info, you could face serious consequences—like getting fired.</p><p>To address this concern, Zuckerberg is dialing back on transparency in company-wide meetings after too many leaks. In an audio clip snagged by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-says-everything-i-say-leaks-in-leaked-meeting-audio/" target="_blank">404 Media</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fortune.com/2025/01/31/meta-fire-staff-for-leaks-zuckerberg-updates-memo/" target="_blank">Fortune</a>), he said, “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks."</p><p>At Meta’s latest meeting, Mark Zuckerberg cited some pretty controversial updates. He talked about cutting back on DEI programs, tweaking hate speech rules (including ones around sexual orientation), and how the company plans to use performance metrics to decide who might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-social-media-reality-labs-layoffs-2024">get hit with layoffs</a>.</p><p>Rosen stressed that when company data gets leaked or stolen, the fallout isn’t just about the immediate security risks—it goes way beyond that.</p><p>"Our teams become demoralized, and we all waste time that is better spent working on our products and toward our goals and mission," he said.</p><p>To crack down on leaks, Meta is ditching the old Q&A style for a voting system. The company is switching to a “poll” system where employees can submit questions ahead of time and vote on them. That way, the discussions focus on the topics everyone actually cares about—and hopefully, fewer details end up spilling out.</p><p>Meta used to let employees throw questions into the open during Q&A sessions, with upvotes deciding which ones got the spotlight. But this year, things changed—the vote counts were hidden, and commenting got shut down, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/603754/mark-zuckerberg-tells-employees-to-buckle-up-in-leaked-all-hands-meeting" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Big companies with tons of employees are basically leak magnets—it’s almost inevitable that some sensitive info or internal drama will slip out. The bigger the team, the harder it is to keep everything under wraps.</p>

<p><em><strong>Several people have written in complaining about Music Player - MP3 Player from Red Sky Labs (formerly known as Muzio Player). None of them had anything good to say.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It seems that the app went with a freemium subscription model, showing ads unless a user pays a monthly fee. That's fine, but when Red Sky Labs did this, they cancelled the premium plan of  users who had previously paid for an ad-free experience.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Play Store reviews confirm this, so I'm naming the company to warn you to consider its past behavior before you give it any money.</strong></em></p>
<p>I hate to hear about this sort of thing, but it's more common than you think. I've been bitten by the very same bug with another app that went free with a subscription after I gave them $5.99 for extra content. You can guess what happened when the app updated. There is a very good chance something similar has happened to you, too.</p><p>Why? Are mobile app stores filled with dishonest people trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">scam a couple of bucks</a> at a time until they've built a fortune? Not really, though those people certainly exist; it's just too easy to get away with it, so app publishers may simply not care.</p>
<p>Here's the rub — it's not legal to do what Red Sky Labs did with its music player. It's also against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google/developer-content-policy/" rel="nofollow">Google's Play Store rules</a>. And neither of those things matters because of the small amount of money involved. If you pay for a lifetime service, it is expected to last the lifetime of one of the parties. If you change your business model, you need to make accommodations for people who have already paid.</p><p>Good luck getting anyone to care about it and help you get your five bucks back because it's <em>only</em> five bucks. You're not taking some developer to small claims court over five bucks. No lawyer will take that as a case because it's only five bucks. It's your five bucks, and if you're like me, you feel willing to fight through Mordor to get it back, but nobody else cares about your five bucks.</p>

<p>Google and Apple <em>should</em> care, and on some level, they do. But they each have bigger things to worry about. With millions of apps moving through mobile stores the majority of time and effort is spent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">making sure they are safe</a> and they handle the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/problem-android-permissions-too-much-information-and-not-enough-information-all-once">intricate permissions</a> correctly. And that's surely hard to manage, so I'm not surprised that reports about this to Google go mostly unanswered. <strong>Do not let this stop you from reporting the offending app.</strong></p>
<p>Also, if you're so inclined, don't forget about posting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/thanks-reddit-you-can-now-block-youtube-ads-without-going-through-any-hoops">Reddit</a> and other social media so other people can read and pile on. Attention is how you rectify this kind of problem. If enough people complain, Google or Apple must act, and the app publisher may even find a way to fix the problem so they aren't forced to give a bunch of people five bucks in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-redeem-google-play-points-movies-shows-and-apps-google-tv">app store credit</a>.</p><p>Finally, send detailed reports about what's happening to every tech website you regularly visit. When I see several people saying the same thing, I look into it. If it's something other people need to hear — like an app publisher bringing back the ads and keeping the five bucks — I'll write about it.</p><p>This app has over 100 million downloads at Google Play. People need to know more about the company before it gets another 100 million.</p>

<ul><li>New trademarks in the UK and New Zealand hint that Samsung’s mixed reality headset might be called “Beyond.”</li><li>The New Zealand trademark application lists products like VR, AR, and XR headsets, potentially linking “Beyond” to Samsung’s upcoming device.</li><li>However, BigScreenVR already holds a trademark for "Beyond," though its registration details are unclear.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New trademarks in the UK and New Zealand are pointing to Samsung’s mixed reality headset being called “Beyond.”</p><p>Back in December, Samsung and Google gave us a preview of their joint XR headset project, known internally as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>. They shared a few images and teased some possible features for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> platform, giving us a taste of what’s to come.</p><p>At last month’s Samsung Unpacked 2025 event, the much-hyped XR headset got a quick, low-key showcase. Even though it’s been over a month since the teaser, we’re still in the dark about what the device will actually be called.</p><p>As spotted by Brad Lynch, new trademark applications in the UK and New Zealand might have spilled the beans on what Samsung’s upcoming mixed-reality headset will be called (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xrdailynews.com/samsung-mr-headset-may-launch-as-galaxy-beyond/" target="_blank">XR Daily News</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung’s recently unveiled Mixed Reality Headset may be called the “Samsung Beyond” or “Galaxy Beyond”This is based on trademarks filed in the UK and New Zealand last monthThanks @LaidBackDev_ for the heads up! pic.twitter.com/C3qShVxURr<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1885206610412249524">January 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The filings suggest the device could roll out as either "Samsung Beyond."</p><p>The New Zealand trademark application covers a wide variety of products, from TVs and smart glasses to digital door locks. But what really stands out is the mention of VR, AR, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">XR headsets</a>, hinting that this could be tied to the highly anticipated device.</p><p>If the trademark gets the green light, "Beyond" is likely to become the name for Samsung’s upcoming headset.</p><p>That said, BigScreenVR already has a headset called "Beyond" and was quick to chime in on Lynch’s tweet, saying they hold the trademark for the name. But here’s the catch—details about where and how their trademark is registered are still up in the air.</p><p>Project Moohan is still in the prototype stage, so details like the release date and price for Samsung’s XR headset are a mystery for now. That said, whispers are floating around that it could cost at least half as much as Apple’s Vision Pro.</p><p>In his YouTube video, Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) highlighted that the headset ditches the over-the-head strap, opting for a single adjustable strap at the back, much like the Meta Quest Pro. Brownlee mentioned that this setup, paired with the distinct facial interface, makes it feel pretty comfortable without needing the extra strap—unlike the Vision Pro, which doesn’t quite pull it off.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims that Samsung could name its first tri-fold the "Galaxy G Fold" with new "display and film" hardware applied to it.</li><li>Rumors once again suggest a 10-inch display and a "slightly thicker" build compared to Huawei's Mate XT.</li><li>Samsung teased a tri-fold during its Unpacked reveal, but rumors are split between a late 2025 or "early" 2026 launch for it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New rumors are coming to light about Samsung's recently teased tri-fold device during an Unpacked segment.</p><p>Murmurs about Samsung's tri-fold were posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/yeux1122/223743092951">Naver by Lanzuk</a>, who claims the device will be called the "Galaxy G Fold" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/samsung-tri-fold-galaxy-g-fold-report/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster goes into some purported specs, stating the phone will feature a "newly developed display and film" specifically for it. Apparently, these new pieces of hardware haven't been applied to the company's typical book-style device, the Z Fold.</p><p>Other alleged specifications include the device's 10-inch display when unfolded fully and a height of 6.54 inches.</p><p>Speaking of the phone's purported build, rumors claim Samsung's tri-fold, which will likely go up against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei's Mate XT</a>, weighs "the same" as the Chinese device, but is also "slightly thicker."</p><p>For its folding method, the tipster states Samsung's version will "fold/unfold on both sides."</p><p>Its launch details are still being speculated; however, current rumors pin its launch either "later this year" or "early 2026." Later in 2025 could push us past Samsung's usual summer Unpacked and into the fall. But, we'll have to wait and see how the company plays this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yocDkSssKZahVRHh532ZJY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-10.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yocDkSssKZahVRHh532ZJY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some aspects of the current rumors that we're hearing consistently now, like the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored">a "G-shaped" fold style</a>. It was reported earlier in January that Samsung could deploy this unique folding shape for the device to improve its display's durability. The folding style shake-up could involve an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-phone-development-rumor">inward</a>" mechanic, as well. To elaborate, the report claims the device will have an "in-folding method that folds the inside of the screen inward twice."</p><p>Moreover, there were rumors that the new display tech the "G Fold" could have is something new from Samsung Display. That side of the Korean OEM is supposedly preparing to debut this new screen tech, which <em>could </em>happen during MWC 2025.</p><p>The idea of a Samsung tri-fold has become even more real after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">teased the device</a> during Unpacked. In a long line of devices in-development, one silhouette, for a tri-fold, was spotted. A phone like this from Samsung has been rumored/thought about for years now — which was magnified by Huawei's surprise entry. Samsung didn't go into specifics about the phone during Unpacked.</p><p>However, rumors claim the company could begin producing the phone in preparation for launch in Q2 2025. So, perhaps these "late 2025" expectations could be met. Either way, let's not hold our breath. Things can always change.</p>

<ul><li>Google just made the Pixel Weather app way better by letting you easily switch between measurement units.</li><li>The new update adds a dedicated page where you can set units for rain, wind, pressure, and visibility.</li><li>Before, changing units meant messing with your phone’s language or region settings, which affected way more than just the app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has finally given the Pixel Weather app a nice little upgrade, making it super easy to switch between different measurement units.</p><p>Since launching in August 2024 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-new-weather-app-for-the-pixel-9-is-showing-up-early">revamped Pixel Weather app has been a hit</a>, thanks to its fresh design and smart weather summaries. But it hasn’t been all sunshine—users have been a bit frustrated with how clunky it is to tweak measurement units for things like rain and wind speed.</p><p>While temperature unit conversion has been around for a while, other metrics were left out. Now, Google seems to be fixing that.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-weather-app-measurements-units-apk-teardown-3506241/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is rolling out Pixel Weather version 1.0.20250106.720365328.release, and it’s bringing a dedicated "Weather units" page. This update lets you pick your preferred units for stuff like rain, wind speed, pressure, and visibility—finally breaking free from the old system where these settings were stuck to your phone’s language.</p><p>Before, tweaking measurement units in the Pixel Weather app was a bit of a headache—you had to mess with your system language or regional settings, which affected way more than just the app.</p><p>Now, you can pick your favorite units for each metric by heading to <em>Profile icon</em> > <em>Pixel Weather settings</em> > <em>Weather units</em>. And if you’re tweaking temperature units, the "Temperature" page is still your go-to spot.</p>

<p>The Pixel Weather app keeps it simple and clean, and gives you all the weather basics at a glance. With its user-friendly layout, you can check the current temperature, upcoming forecasts, and extra details like humidity and wind speed without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The big win with the new Pixel Weather update is that you finally get full control over your measurement units, so you don't have to worry about messing up other apps—just set it up how you like it. The update is hitting the Play Store now for supported Pixel devices.</p>

<ul><li>Code found in the Pixel Watch Management Service system app shows a reference to "Adaptive charging."</li><li>Pixel phones currently learn from your charging habits to determine when to limit charging to 80% to protect battery life.</li><li>Wear OS watches currently have no way to stop charging before 100% power, though some can send a push notification to your phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has spent the last year hyper-focused on improving Android smartwatches' battery life, particularly its own Pixel Watch 3. Now, based on an APK teardown of Pixel Watch system software, it appears the next battery-preserving feature will be adaptive charging, ported over from Pixel phones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-adaptive-charging-apk-3522565/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> posted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-adaptive-charging-apk-3522565/">APK teardown</a> on Monday showing the following string of code:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-html" language="html" ><code><uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.wearable.pixel.pdms.permission.ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_SERVICE"/></code></pre>
<p>While the site didn't find any additional info, it's a fair assumption that the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-adaptive-charge-silent-updates">Pixel Adaptive Charging</a> feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and other Google phones will port to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> in a highly similar form — if not other Android watches.</p><p>On Pixel phones, if you turn on Charging optimization, the Android software will "learn" from your charging habits for two weeks; then, whenever you plug your phone in at night, it will shut off charging at 80% and only bring it to 100% at the point that you typically unplug it in the morning.</p><p>You can also manually limit charging to 80% on Pixel phones, so we're curious if that'll be another option for Pixel Watches, in addition to adaptive charging. Given that the Pixel Watch 3 lasts at least 24 hours with AOD enabled — and can last up to 48 hours with lighter use — it should last you a full day even if you put it on at 80% power.</p><p>Depending on its size, the Pixel Watch 3 takes about 35 or 50 minutes to hit 80%, and 60 or 80 minutes to hit 100%. The slower charging past 80% is already a built-in form of adaptive charging. Still, once your watch hits 100%, your battery capacity <em>will</em> steadily decrease over time, which is why Google enabled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-fully-charged-notifications-are-finally-rolling-out-widely">full-charge notifications last year</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.30%;"><img id="4VWzwYM3b2xvaPNLUwKzM3" name="Pixel-Watch-3-developer-mode" alt="Developer options on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VWzwYM3b2xvaPNLUwKzM3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2259" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, this hidden code suggests Pixel Watch owners who don't wear their watch overnight will have the option to enable adaptive charging and preserve that capacity as much as possible, while still having their watch fully topped off in the morning.</p><p>Since it's a "permission" feature, Adaptive Charging should be off by default until you enable it; we know that some users will prefer their watch to hit 100% as fast as possible.</p><p>We know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> should arrive this fall on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, presumably with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">new Gemini assistant</a>. But it's fair to assume that this adaptive charging feature will come to current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> models much sooner than that, and will hopefully be available on Galaxy and OnePlus Watches, too (eventually).</p><p>Even though Google has successfully extended battery life on its newer models, the Pixel Watch series remains comparatively short-lived when you look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-for-battery-life">best smartwatches for long battery life</a>. It needs all the help it can get to keep what capacity it has!</p>

<p>Google has reportedly started adding the missing pieces for its long-awaited encrypted messaging with emergency services.</p><p>During an APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-prepares-rcs-based-text-to-911-apk-teardown-3522456/">Android Authority</a>, several new strings of code were added to Google Messages about 911 RCS texting support. It seems the company is beginning to add the necessary pieces for proper functionality, like "location_permission." Granting access to your device's location will likely be a requirement if you're interested in texting emergency services in the event of a problem.</p><p>There is another string, "enable_emergency_action," which seems to concern the users sent message when contacting 911.</p><p>Furthermore, there's a larger, overall section of code added: "enable_emergency_rcs-messaging."</p><p>The publication adds that the new code was discovered in the latest Google Messages update, version 20250129. While it's stated that this beta "enables" RCS texting with 911, there's not much else to surface. What this could look like (officially) on-device wasn't detailed, nor anything else of notable interest.</p><p>Perhaps we're coming up on its widespread Android rollout, considering Google said as much last summer.</p>

<p>In June 2024, Google announced that it was bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-announces-911-rcs-texting-to-android">RCS texting services with 911</a>. It  was stated that support would let users send high-quality images and videos to first responders to help them understand "your situation." Users can also see when the authorities are actively responding to your request for aid. More importantly, Google's partnership with RapidSOS brings the location-sharing side of this feature.</p><p>Data from the FCC showed that roughly 53% of the emergency centers in the U.S. support text messages as a viable form of communication. Through this 911 RCS support, Google seeks to bring it to every call center/agency across the country for free.</p><p>The company said in its June announcement that it planned to roll this out to Android users "this winter." We have crossed into February already, so hopefully these newfound Google Message strings indicate its approaching release.</p><p>Earlier this month, Google made good on another feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-more-users-regions-stable">dual SIM RCS support</a>. More users in the U.S., Canada, and Germany on the Pixel 9 and a few Galaxy devices started noticing the update arrive. The feature seemingly arrived for those on Verizon, AT&T, and USMobile plans. The patch brings additional settings, which let users choose to activate RCS for both SIMs or for whichever you'd prefer.</p>

<ul><li>Huawei patented a 3D fingerprint sensor for its smartwatches for both biometric ID and gesture controls.</li><li>The patent suggests you'd be able to twist your finger (counter-)clockwise to adjust watch settings like volume and brightness.</li><li>Smartwatches would also recognize multiple fingerprints in order to register different actions to specific fingers.</li><li>Samsung and Apple previously patented smartwatch fingerprint sensors in 2018 and 2022, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Smartwatches with contactless payments universally rely on clunky PIN systems for security. We've seen Galaxy and Apple Watch patents for in-display fingerprint sensors or Touch ID built into a button, but neither smartwatch brand has brought the idea to actual products. Now Huawei has an even more intriguing fingerprint smartwatch patent, tantalizing us with a feature we may never see for ourselves.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/huawei-multi-functional-3d-fingerprint-sensor-patent-details/" target="_blank">MySmartPrice</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/news/huawei-hidden-smartwatch-fingerprint-sensor-patent" target="_blank">Wareable</a>), Huawei's patent describes a three-dimensional "advanced optical fingerprint sensor" built into the AMOLED smartwatch display that can recognize your fingerprint at any angle.</p><p>Huawei's patented idea is to let you register multiple fingerprints, then attribute specific actions to each finger; in one figure, tapping a message with your thumb, index, or middle finger triggers three different responses, including calling the messenger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="u4yBWa33a3gRMnvdLYXxY" name="huawei-fingerprint-patent" alt="A patent figure showing a generic smartwatch and a hand with a pointing index finger at various angles, showing the watch owner pressing their finger on the display and twisting it in different directions to trigger specific actions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4yBWa33a3gRMnvdLYXxY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="820" height="461" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In another patent image, it shows the smartwatch owner twisting their index finger to "control volume and display brightness through gestures," with the direction of the twist — clockwise or counterclockwise — deciding whether the volume goes up or down.</p><p>Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> and Apple Watches can recognize gestures like finger pinches for shortcuts, but long-pressing or twisting specific fingers on a screen might feel more exact and natural to some users. Recognizing multiple fingerprints would also let you set multiple favorite apps or actions.</p><p>Plus, of course, you'd finally have the option to use a payment app without needing to hen-and-peck a PIN number on a tiny watch screen, or worry about someone else guessing your PIN. Instead, the Huawei watch would prompt you for your fingerprint after you trigger Google Wallet (or Huawei Pay, in this case).</p>

<p>Samsung first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.patentlymobile.com/2018/11/samsung-patent-illustrates-continued-work-on-under-display-fingerprint-scanning-for-future-smartphones-and-galaxy-watch.html">patented</a> the idea of an under-display fingerprint sensor in 2018, but the patent itself was quite vague, also suggesting the idea that their watches might have an under-display camera for an "iris scanner" to authenticate the wearer. Neither ever came to pass, and it seems unlikely Samsung has any current plans for fingerprint tech, no matter how useful it might be in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>Apple's 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/patent-reveals-apple-watch-touch-id-not-where-we-expected">Touch ID patent</a> felt much more thought out, with a sensor built into the Side button that could authenticate the user or approve a transaction. But despite how useful this sounded, nothing has come of it, nor of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/touch-id-might-be-coming-apple-watch">previous report</a> in 2022 claiming Apple wanted to stick the fingerprint sensor in the Apple Watch S7 crown.</p><p>So while Huawei's patent sounds intriguing, it's a bit bittersweet to consider the Chinese smartwatch brand potentially being the first to implement it in its watches, considering you rarely see Huawei products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/huawei-sets-sights-squarely-on-samsung-with-watch-gt-5-series">Huawei GT 5 Pro</a> sold outside of Asia. A large portion of smartwatch power users who depend on contactless payments will have to keep tapping in a PIN code for the foreseeable future, with no better alternative.</p><p>Of course, Huawei might very well never use this fingerprint sensor idea, either! The brand may decide that embedding a complex 3D fingerprint sensor may be more trouble than it's worth, due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/researchers-detail-bruteprint-attack-android-fingerprint-sensors">security issues</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-fingerprint-problems-continue">fingerprint recognition problems</a> we've seen on Android phones over the years.</p>
