<hr>
<p>Following a truly odd experience with Google&apos;s AI Overview results last week, the company&apos;s Head of Search, Liz Reid, is trying to clear the air.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/">Keyword post</a>, Reid touched on the strange and down-right false answers that Google&apos;s AI-powered Search results provided users. Reid stated that while some of the odd responses users posted on social media were false screenshots, others truly occurred. The answers people received were attributed to "queries that people don’t commonly do" — and therein lay the problem.</p><p>It&apos;s because of this problem that Google is going back into the kitchen and taking a hard look at how its AI interprets "nonsensical" and "satirical" queries.</p><p>Reid used one example that popped up everywhere: "How many rocks should I eat?" While no one in their right mind would do such a thing, the AI doesn&apos;t really know that. It&apos;s simply fulfilling a query. The company&apos;s Search lead stated that since there isn&apos;t much data on the internet to "seriously contemplate" such a question, it&apos;s turned into an "information gap."</p><p>So, what happened is that the AI did its best to answer the question and ended up pulling an internet troll&apos;s answer to an outrageous question. Reid added that the AI also pulled sarcastic information from forum sites (think Reddit) about using glue to stick cheese on a pizza.</p><p>Google is working on fixing its AI Overviews on a broad scale rather than condensing the issues down to a singular, random query. Reid informs that the company has started building better detection systems for those nonsensical queries and "limited the inclusion of satire and humor content." Another parameter includes a limit on how much "user-generated" content the AI takes into consideration.</p><p>For health and important news stories, Google remains adamant about not displaying AI Overviews to preserve the facts and authenticity of available information.</p>

<p>Google Search&apos;s AI pulls information from all across the internet, which can be a problem when there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">trolls and shitposters around</a>. Hopefully, with the company reiterating its encouragement of user feedback, these problems will slowly begin to reduce. We may not be at a point where it&apos;s completely zero but, hopefully, more facts start going around than fiction.</p><p>Moreover, this problem with AI Overviews came a couple of weeks after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">rolled them out to everyone</a>. During I/O 2024, Google stated that its overviews would arrive to U.S. folks on May 14, alongside some query adjustment settings. Typically, these overviews are a quick snippet, providing a user with the most important bits of information in a bite-sized piece.</p><p>Additionally, these AI Overviews provide links so users can do a little fact-checking to verify the bot&apos;s answer.</p>

<p>Last April, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/is-there-anything-chromebook-cant-do">I wrote a piece</a> about the negative stigma that still surrounds the idea of someone using a Chromebook. By and large, that stigma remains, but I think that there&apos;s never been a better time to buy a Chromebook over a Windows PC.</p><p>If you ask around here at Android Central, there&apos;s a pretty good chance you&apos;ll find that I might just be the most pessimistic member of the team. While I love and have an affinity for various devices, my mind mostly defaults to the negatives. This includes Chromebooks and ChromeOS, so when our accessories editor, Namerah, asked for my opinion about an article she was working on about switching to Windows, my initial impression was one of agreement. </p><p>However, after letting my thoughts stew and marinate for a little bit longer, I came to a surprising and different conclusion. In her piece, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/why-im-switching-from-chromebook-to-surface-tablet">she explains</a> why she&apos;s giving up on Chromebooks and will instead be picking up a Surface for her next computer. There was a time when I would have said, "Hell yeah, I can definitely get behind that." However, the days of scoffing at the idea of using a Chromebook over a Windows laptop or MacBook are gone, at least in most regards.</p><p>Namerah&apos;s piece demonstrates how the stigma around Chromebooks is still very much alive. That&apos;s not to say her experience using one isn&apos;t valid—it very much is—as we all have our preferences, and not everyone will enjoy using a Chromebook as much as a Windows PC. However, Chromebooks are much more capable machines than many people think they are.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6wAi4bn9mAvBUiFMVecLn5" name="surface-go-3-wc.jpg" alt="Aluminum lid on the Microsoft Surface Go 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wAi4bn9mAvBUiFMVecLn5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One example pointed out in the piece is trying to resize "an image to a specific size or sharing files to and from a ChromeOS tablet." For the first one, I would argue that it&apos;s actually a bit easier to accomplish, as there are two different ways to go about resizing an image.</p>
<p>When using the native Gallery app, there&apos;s a button at the top, and then you can either manually resize it or choose one of the presets at the bottom. You can also open the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, view your "On Device" images, click the Edit button, and make changes from there. Not to mention, Google continues to add other editing options, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> with ChromeOS 125.</p><p>As for sharing files between devices, this is something I&apos;ve complained forever about, as nothing seemed to work as seamlessly as Apple&apos;s AirDrop. Although it&apos;s still not <em>quite</em> as smooth as it should be, Google&apos;s continued improvements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> have paid dividends. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="66Nuyoq3cMjPTiyQQBzGp7" name="phone-hub-chromebook-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4.jpg" alt="Phone Hub open on Chromebook with Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/66Nuyoq3cMjPTiyQQBzGp7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-phone-hub-on-chromebooks">Phone Hub</a>, which also works pretty well, even if it is limited to only showing you a few recent photos and files. If anything, I&apos;d like for Google to make it so that I can view all of the files and photos on my phone, not just a handful of the most recent ones.</p><p>The piece goes on to talk about problems with various peripherals not working with Chromebooks. This isn&apos;t something I&apos;ve experienced frequently, and the only times I&apos;ve personally run into problems have been when using a gaming mouse. The majority of the time, it&apos;s a "connect and go" situation, even if the peripheral doesn&apos;t explicitly have the "Works with Chromebook" stamp. I&apos;ve even managed to get a spare Apple Magic Trackpad paired with a Chromebook, and it works pretty darn well.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say there isn&apos;t room for improvement, but it&apos;s also something that the ChromeOS team is working on. Back with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-m123-april-update">ChromeOS 123</a>, added the ability to customize what your mouse buttons do, provided that you&apos;re using a mouse with more than two buttons. It also added a flag to enable keyboard shortcut customization before it was enabled by default with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chrome-os-m124-may-update-changes">ChromeOS 124</a>. </p><p>Ultimately, Namerah explains how the Surface Go 3 "checks all the boxes" as it "can be used as a tablet, too, and because it runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-11">Windows 11</a>, you can use it like any other computer." This was the part that really caught my attention, simply because I find Windows on a tablet to be downright awful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Y7BCWC29rmYutaNX8PCpue" name="lenovo-legion-go-wc.jpg" alt="The Lenovo Legion Go's controllers pop-off for desktop mode, along with an FPS-specialized mouse-like controller." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y7BCWC29rmYutaNX8PCpue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve learned this more and more as I&apos;ve gone deeper into gaming handhelds such as the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, MSI Claw, and others. Trying to do anything outside of the OEM&apos;s dashboard without a mouse and keyboard is just asking for punishment. That&apos;s why I have an arsenal of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-keyboards-android-tablets">foldable Bluetooth keyboards</a> with built-in trackpads—well, that and my continued love of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. </p><p>Again, I&apos;m not saying that Namerah is wrong or that I&apos;m right. What I <em>am</em> saying is that ChromeOS is much more capable now than it was even six months ago. The proof is in the pudding, as evidenced by the release of ChromeOS 125 and the announcement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">six new Chromebook models</a>.</p><p>At the end of last year, I wrote about the things that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-chromeos-wishlist-2024">I hoped to see from ChromeOS and Chromebooks</a> over the course of 2024. With one fell swoop, Google and its hardware partners checked off two of the four boxes. ChromeOS 125 brought with it Gemini integration, something that I&apos;d argue should have been there from the start. Meanwhile, ASUS introduced a new ChromeOS tablet, and it seems we could be in store for a few more options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf" name="google-gemini-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Gemini on Android at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, I don&apos;t expect to go 4/4 with my predictions. Doing so would require Google to resurrect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Pixelbook successor</a> and for a Chromebook to be released with a dedicated GPU along with more than 128GB of storage. I don&apos;t see either of those things happening, but hey, a guy can dream.</p><p>If you&apos;re deciding between a Chromebook and a Windows device, I&apos;d recommend thinking twice. Sure, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Copilot Plus</a> features seem cool, but if you look a bit deeper, Microsoft is morphing Windows into the ultimate platter of ads.</p><p>Recently, Microsoft has been testing out different ways to serve users more ads, but I&apos;m not just talking about hounding you to set Edge as the default browser. I mean actual ads from companies other than Microsoft that show up in the Start Menu or Settings app. As pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/the-best-way-to-remove-ads-from-the-windows-11-start-menu-is-now-on-sale">Sean Endicott of Windows Central</a>, "The fact that Microsoft won&apos;t even allow people to pay to remove ads suggests the company makes more money off promotions than people would be willing to pay."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hd3VyrM42ivVVbFLeLpjBE" name="windows-start-menu-ads-wc.jpg" alt="Windows 11's Start menu will soon feature more ads, as will the Settings app on your PC." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hd3VyrM42ivVVbFLeLpjBE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sean Endicott / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s reached a breaking point where people are creating user-friendly tools to alter the registry in an effort to get rid of ads. It&apos;s also the same reason why I&apos;ve been attempting to become more familiar with Linux, as the writing is on the wall for the day when I have to watch a 30-second ad just to unlock my desktop Windows PC.</p><p>For the time being, Microsoft is the only one doing anything like this with its operating system. Google and Apple shove "ads" in your face, but they are the ones that we&apos;ve basically ignored for years and aren&apos;t being blatantly added to things like the launcher. </p><p>If anything, I&apos;d argue that now&apos;s actually the perfect time to switch <em>to</em> ChromeOS, especially as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">more Chromebook Plus devices hit the market</a>. There are still kinks to work out, but it&apos;s clear that Google is committed to the platform. How often can we say such a thing about something that Google offers? </p>

<ul><li>An APK deep dive showed that Netflix could roll out an HDR streaming toggle for users on Android.</li><li>The toggle would let users swap between HDR streaming or SDR if they choose, however, this is still experimental.</li><li>HDR has been known to demand more power from a phone, draining its battery quicker and taking up more bandwidth.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There are whispers that Netflix might have started developing an HDR toggle for its streaming services on Android, and it could be a good thing.</p><p>As spotted during an APK deep dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-hdr-toggle-android-app-apk-teardown-3447290/">Android Authority</a>, beta 3.5 based on the latest 8.117 version of the Netflix app shows signs of an HDR toggle. A few strings in the app&apos;s code state "Android Allow SDR/HDR Streaming Selection sic." Another string in the code mentions a "switch button" so users can quickly hop between HDR streaming or the lower SDR option.</p><p>HDR (High Dynamic Range) bolsters a streamed video by giving the user brighter colors, increasing its overall quality. The other option, SDR, stands for "Standard" dynamic range, which offers a "lower" quality compared to the former. Google offers HDR streaming on YouTube and explains as much on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272?hl=en#:~:text=HDR%20lets%20you%20show%20more,265%20(HEVC)%20video%20codec.">support page</a>.</p><p>The publication also notes that HDR can be quite consuming for devices that support it because of its hunger for power. HDR can drain a device&apos;s battery much faster due to its demands while also consuming more data. The post cites an interview between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/dolby/151391-hdr-saviour-streaming/">Pocket-Lint and a Dolby executive</a> who stated that HDR consumes "5% to 10% more data" than SDR streaming.</p><p>The executive added that this number is "negligible," so it&apos;s not that big of a deal.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication reiterated a problem it noticed with the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s24-hdr-playback-test-3426195/">HDR playback</a> where it would dim the display, causing an unenjoyable experience.</p><p>For now, the existence of an HDR toggle for the app on Android is "experimental." Things can go either way, so we&apos;ll have to play it by ear from here on out.</p>

<p>While we wait for what comes next, Netflix detailed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">plans for 2024</a>, which, surprise (not really), includes another price hike. Earlier this year, the streaming platform seemingly saw the end-user as the catalyst behind its ongoing investments. While the company said that a reason behind a price hike could deal with "inflation or higher data center costs," its plans for entertainment were also a factor.</p><p>Even if users don&apos;t actively engage or care about certain pieces of entertainment, a price hike will still hit, regardless.</p>

<ul><li>Threads has pushed a change to its desktop UI that wastes a lot of space in the app's view.</li><li>The feed is still centered, however, users can only change the type of feed in a drop-down menu nestled above it.</li><li>The remainder of Threads' UI is thrown off to the left side, mirroring the likes of Instagram on computers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Threads has pushed an update to its user interface on the desktop and is giving us Instagram vibes.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich spotted the change earlier this morning (May 31) and made note of the sheer Instagram callbacks. For one, Threads on PCs now looks like it&apos;s designed purely for the vertical screen, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>. Sutrich noted the increased amount of wasted space surrounding the Threads feed, which can be changed from "For You" to "Following" and more.</p><p>Users can quickly rediscover content they&apos;ve "liked" or "saved" through that drop-down menu.</p><p>The feed is still centered, however, those feed settings are now the only piece of UI remaining at the top in a drop-down menu. Other options, like Home, Search, Activity, and your profile are now off to the far left side vertically.</p><p>The new post button is nestled on the bottom right of the screen.</p><p>Threads has also implemented some slight color alterations, with the primary feed becoming a little lighter than the background in light and dark mode.</p>

<p>Instagram has looked like this for a while now on desktop, with its primary feed centered, stories on top, and other UI elements tossed to the left side. While Instagram&apos;s version offers a lot of space, it&apos;s taken down a bit due to its written-out feature names and a box of suggested profiles on the right.</p><p>The old Threads view was much more confined, featuring everything one would need in the center of their screen on a PC.</p><p>Additionally, there&apos;s a chance Threads is trying to appease <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> and other tablet UI devices with this change. How Instagram&apos;s desktop UI functions for such devices fits perfectly, so maybe we should&apos;ve seen this coming. Threads&apos; new UI for computers seems widely available now.</p><p>In other news, Threads rolled out a feature that allowed users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-allows-users-to-limit-quote-posts-on-the-app-and-web">limit who could quote</a> their posts on the platform earlier in May. After posting, the owner can select a few options: Anyone, Profiles you follow, and Mentioned Only. What&apos;s more, X (formerly Twitter) users will recognize this.</p><p>Instagram&apos;s head, Adam Mosseri, stated the change is designed to let users "restrict others who look to demean or troll them, a safe space to share thoughts..."</p>

Fortunately, the Big Three carrier has just launched a Samsung Galaxy S23 deal that lacks <em>most </em>of that pesky fine print: add a line with an eligible data plan and you&apos;ll score enough promo credits to make the phone 100% free. No kidding. </p><p>All of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon&apos;s current Unlimited plans</a> will get you the free phone, but if you choose the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, you could choose to get a FREE Amazon 65-inch Omni Series Fire TV instead. That&apos;s a $799.99 value, the only catch is that you&apos;ll have to pay full price for the phone to get the TV. </p>

<p>The compact <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> may be last year's flagship, but it's still a sweet Android phone, coming complete with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, a lovely 6.1-inch AMOLED display, and years of software support guaranteed. You even get to enjoy all of those fancy Galaxy AI features that the OEM has been talking about.  Buy the phone and add an eligible line to your Verizon service and you'll get $699.99 in promo credits over 36 months. That makes the S23 completely free. </p>
<p>That being said, if you don't mind paying for the phone, you can choose the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan and get a FREE 65-inch smart TV out of the deal, because why not? <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s23/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8b668dca-1628-4ee3-92cf-3feef5bc87ed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB: $699.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB: $699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Of course, if money isn&apos;t an object, you&apos;ll be better off going straight to the newer Samsung Galaxy S24 — but when you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-s23">Galaxy S23 vs S24</a>, you&apos;ll see that the two phones aren&apos;t actually <em>that </em>different. Sure, the Galaxy S23 has an older processor and a slightly smaller display, but you won&apos;t notice any real difference with day to day use. So if you&apos;re a Verizon user or you&apos;re looking to switch, why not take advantage of this offer and get one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released last year?  </p>

It can withstand the pressure 50 meters of water can create, but that doesn't mean you can submerge it in 50 meters (164 feet) of water.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-to-keep-in-mind-when-using-your-fitbit-ace-lte-near-water-2">What to keep in mind when using your Fitbit Ace LTE near water</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>&apos;s 5ATM basic rating means atmospheres and is not waterproof enough to go to the pool&apos;s deep end for long periods. Instead, the kid&apos;s wearable is water-resistant. This means kids can wear it without worrying about water damage when splashing around in the bathtub, playing in the rain, or helping mom and dad with the dishes.</p><p>ATM represents atmosphere, which is the international standard for how much pressure the wearable can withstand. So, the Fitbit Ace LTE can withstand 50 meters of pressure for 10 minutes. If you see a 3ATM rating, that means that the watch can only withstand 30 meters of water pressure. The lowest rating you&apos;ll see is 1ATM, and the highest is 20ATM.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">These smartwatches</a> are tested in a lab with fresh water sources, not salt or highly chlorinated pool water. To be safe, it is a very good idea to take the smartwatch off before diving into the pool.</p><p>What&apos;s the difference between waterproof and water-resistant? When something is waterproof, it&apos;s impervious and entirely sealed from any damage water can cause. When a device is water-resistant, it can resist the perforation of water up to a certain point. When the Fitbit Ace LTE <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kid&apos;s smartwatch</a> leaves the factory, it comes with a rating of 5ATM under ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard 22810:2010. Still, that rating can degrade over time due to drops, normal wear and tear, disassembly, or damage. So, it&apos;s a good idea to put the Fitbit Ace LTE in a waterproof pouch to keep it safe.</p>

<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE kid&apos;s wearable is designed for use in shallow water and does not involve activities with water at high velocity or temperature. If you get some water on the wearable, Fitbit recommends drying the watch and the band for proper care. The smartwatch is not dustproof, so extra care is a must in dusty areas, which will help prolong the device&apos;s use for a while.</p><p>You won&apos;t find an IP rating on the Fitbit Ace LTE, but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t tell the amount of water it can be exposed to, thanks to the 5ATM rating. What&apos;s the difference between an IP and ATM rating? The IP rating indicates the protection a device has against water and dust. The highest IP rating available is the IP69K.</p><p>As noted before, an ATM rating measures the water pressure a device can withstand before suffering water damage, and is more common in wearables. A 20ATM rating is suitable for pressure equal to a depth of 200 meters and can be used in high-speed water sports, snorkeling, diving, and everyday activities such as showering and getting caught in the rain.</p><p>The bottom line: It&apos;s best to put the smartwatch aside when going to the water park to keep it safe. There are waterproof smartwatches made for diving, but those are not kid smartwatches, such as the Apple Watch Ultra 2 or a swim-proof smartwatch from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin lineup</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google Home brings a new ability to control volume on multiple speakers. </li><li>Users can control the volume via the Google Home app or can use their voice through Google Assistant. </li><li>The ability to Group Volume Control from the Android lock screen is also promised.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Home has been adding nifty, highly requested updates to its devices, with the most recent on that went out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-for-web-getting-camera-history-and-clip-editor-in-new-update">March</a>. The feature addition continues as the Google Nest community announced new controls for the Google Home app for Android devices.</p><p>Starting this month, the Google Home app has regained the ability to control volume on multiple speakers or devices at once, the team has announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Controlling-volume-for-multiple-speakers-in-the-Google-Home-app/ba-p/623411">blog post</a>. Users can also control the volume with their voice through Google Assistant.</p><p>The other forthcoming addition will also let users access Group Volume controls directly on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>&apos;s lock screen through smart displays like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Google Nest hub</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fQwbaxdYo82QwAow6DAMc" name="google-home-new-volume-controls.jpg" alt="New volume controls for Google Home app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQwbaxdYo82QwAow6DAMc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The team also shared a how-to guide that helps users enable the updates: opening the app, starting a playback session, and tapping on the mini-player. Users can then tap on the output selector, which allows them to either add or remove the speakers dynamically or select from the existing set of speaker groups. They can then adjust the volume slide bar per their listening preference.</p><p>Additionally, those who prefer controlling their speakers through voice commands can do so through Google Assistant. Just like asking the Assistant to play music, they can command it for their entire speaker group by saying, “Hey Google, turn it up,” which makes the volume increase by 10 percent, or they can also command, “Hey Google, set volume to 40%.”</p>
<p>The full list of compatible hubs for Google Home devices can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7174267">found here</a>, which includes devices like Google Nest Mini, Google Home, Chromecast with Google TV, and more.</p><p>The latest volume-controlling ability follows the addition of camera history and clip editor via a new update rolled out to Google Home for the web in March. It was rolled out to users who opted for Public Preview to test the new features first.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google News began experiencing a worldwide outage on May 31, 2024, around 8 AM ET.</li><li>Some other Google services, like Google Drive, have also displayed errors while trying to edit and create new documents.</li><li>Users across the world have been reporting problems accessing these Google services, meaning it's not just a regional problem.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Friday might be a bit of a slow news day if you&apos;re a free Google News service user. As of 8 AM ET on Friday, May 31, 2024, users around the world began reporting issues accessing the Google News service, which aggregates news Google deems important to them.</p><p>The website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/google/">Downdetector</a> confirms the outage, which Android Central and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/mobile-apps/google-news-goes-down-for-millions-of-users-worldwide-in-mysterious-outage">Tom&apos;s Guide</a> first noticed this morning. Visiting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/">Google News page</a> will display upside down ice cream cones with a rather generic error of "Uh-oh, something went wrong. Please try again."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1195px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="jBoPXX4URBNfAgDsbWAdUi" name="google-news-outage-may-31-2024.jpg" alt="The Google News outage on May 31, 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jBoPXX4URBNfAgDsbWAdUi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1195" height="672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outages like this happen from time to time but services as large and prolific as Google&apos;s often cause a larger wake than others may. It&apos;s not just Google News that&apos;s down— creating new documents in Google Drive has been throwing up errors, too, this morning, and our staff hasn&apos;t been able to get some two-factor authentication dialogs to appear on my phone, which also relies on Google services.</p><p>At the moment, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://status.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud services</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://status.search.google.com/">Google Search services</a> health dashboards don&apos;t show any problems, which is rather strange given the number of users having issues with Google services.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the outage but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h3>
<p>After several hours of downtime, it looks like Google&apos;s services are beginning to stabilize. Earlier today (May 31), Google News was down, displaying upside ice cream cones instead of your usual "Uh-oh, something went wrong" error.</p><p>Moreover, Google&apos;s Downdetector showed a massive spike in reports likely detailing the service outage this morning. That spike has since subsided, pointing toward Google&apos;s services finally showing signs of life. Users should also be able to hop back into their Drive accounts, as well, as that was previously affected this morning.</p>

<p>Spotify is giving its Android app a facelift by ditching the border around its icon, going back to its classic look from five years ago.</p><p>Before this, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-premium-music-video-beta-launch">Spotify</a> icon had a green logo on a black background. Now, thanks to Will Sattelberg of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/spotify-refreshed-android-app-icon/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, we know the new icon is just the green Spotify logo with no black background.</p><p>Originally, the Spotify Android app featured a simple circle with the Spotify logo, just like the desktop version. But in 2019, the company added a black border to support adaptive icons that could change shape.</p><p>For devices with circular icons, the new design fills the entire space with the Spotify logo. It works with both unthemed and themed icons, although the themed ones don’t blend as well with other icons.</p><p>Interestingly, this change only affects devices with circular icons. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy</a> or another device with differently shaped icons, the black border will come back.</p>

<p>Android Police points out that on phones supporting icon shape changes, the change just zooms in on the icon, resulting in some ugly black outlines on non-circular shapes. Samsung phones, in particular, get an extra-thick border.</p><p>This isn’t a huge deal, but it’s definitely a curious change. The black background was distinctive and helped the app stand out. The new borderless version looks a bit strange, especially on phones without circular icons.</p><p>The updated Spotify icon comes with app version 8.9.44.368 and is currently only available on Android, with no changes for the iOS app icon yet.</p>

The focus is now on an even sleeker design, and at a thickness of just 10mm, it is just as svelte as a phone. The Blade 2 has a smaller 12000mah battery — instead of the 20000mAh on the Blade — and as such, the power bank weighs just 328g. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charging-Control-12000mAh-Portable/dp/B0CQT9XLH3">retails for $89 on Amazon</a>, but Baseus is running an enticing deal right now that discounts the Blade 2 by 30%, bringing the effective cost down to just $63.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLqez9LPxVQz3DFoeb2S78" name="baseus-blade-2-10.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 next to Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLqez9LPxVQz3DFoeb2S78.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other differences; the Blade 2 only goes up to 65W, so it isn&apos;t as versatile at charging notebooks. It is also available in interesting color choices, and while that isn&apos;t a consideration when choosing a power bank, the Blade 2 looks a lot better than the standard black option of the Blade.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nAYM5ePkdL2ym4qxK58Vi7" name="baseus-blade-2-9.jpg" alt="Side view of Baseus Blade 2 next to 100W Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nAYM5ePkdL2ym4qxK58Vi7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the design of the Blade 2 is much more refined, and it conveys a sense of style that wasn&apos;t evident on the original Blade. The power bank retains Baseus&apos;s custom design, so you get a rectangular chassis with rounded edges that&apos;s thinner and wider than most power banks. It doesn&apos;t look like a power bank at an initial glance, and the ultra-thin design makes it easily portable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sNhsAqWeKig34KS5z5j7B5" name="baseus-blade-2-1.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 power bank against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNhsAqWeKig34KS5z5j7B5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m using the blue color variant of the Blade 2, and the power bank is also available in silver and orange colors. Baseus bundles a 100W USB-C to USB-C cable in the box as well as a carrying pouch, and the lighter design combined with new colors gives the Blade 2 a much better presence. While I like the design quite a bit, the glossy plastic coat means the power bank is a smudge magnet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s5SoyM999Xpo27ZYFKHcP8" name="baseus-blade-2-11.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 ports next to Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s5SoyM999Xpo27ZYFKHcP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I&apos;m not as enthused about is the port selection; because of the thinner design, Baseus had to ditch the USB-A port, so you only get two USB-C ports on the Blade 2. That again limits the number of devices that can be used with the power bank; I routinely plug in accessories like smartwatches, and they still rely on a USB-A connector.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bdkohnM4QCMnVwbbTE2wA6" name="baseus-blade-2-2.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 has a built-in panel that shows charging information" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdkohnM4QCMnVwbbTE2wA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like its predecessor, the Blade 2 has a built-in screen that shows battery life and charging info. It is brighter and easier to read, and the only issue I have with it is that the battery level is showcased in the center, with the real-time charging details tucked away in the corner — it should have been the other way around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zhd5Qu5SCnVz8fNvi45Gi6" name="baseus-blade-2-6.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 has two USB-C ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhd5Qu5SCnVz8fNvi45Gi6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get the same USB PD 3.0 charging tech, but it only goes up to 65W. This isn&apos;t an issue with the Blade 2 as it&apos;s evident that the power bank is designed to be used with phones, and the 12000mAh battery isn&apos;t large enough to charge notebooks anyway. You can still top up a MacBook and have enough charge left over for a phone, but if you need to do that consistently, you&apos;re much better off with the original Blade.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pho6X3qnzCfb96hhLByyJ7" name="baseus-blade-2-8.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 next to 100W Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pho6X3qnzCfb96hhLByyJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Blade 2 wins out is the portability; the thinner design and lighter weight makes it the ideal choice in daily use. The dual USB-C ports are great for charging two phones at once, and you get the 65W power budget split into 45W and 20W across both ports. On that note, here&apos;s a rundown of the charging profiles that you get with the power bank:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 Output (65W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 Input (60W Max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3A (60W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 (65W Max):</strong> 45W + 20W</li></ul>
<p>I used the power bank with several devices — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> — and didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. It delivered a consistent charge, and was able to fully charge two devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JTVX4U3GVcwkDgXV2akj79" name="baseus-blade-2-14.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 next to Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JTVX4U3GVcwkDgXV2akj79.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the biggest limitation is the 12000mAh battery; while it is still a decent option for charging phones, it doesn&apos;t measure up if you want to use it with notebooks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> feature a 20000mAh battery and 65W charging — Baseus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Charger-Baseus-20000mAh-Charging/dp/B08THCNNCS">makes one that&apos;s just $45</a> — and you get a USB-A port. Yes, these power banks have a "traditional" design and aren&apos;t as sleek as the Blade 2, but they have much better utility, and are a better value.</p><p>Ultimately, the Blade 2 is aimed at a niche; if you want a lightweight power bank and only intend to use it with your phone, it is a decent enough choice. Otherwise, you should just get the standard Blade.</p>
