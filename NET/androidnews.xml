<ul><li>Instagram has started rolling out an update for its DMs, beginning with a new "share live location" feature.</li><li>Users in one-on-one and group chat threads can show where in the world they are with others with a few security/privacy features to help.</li><li>The update also includes the ability to "Nickname" people in DMs and ~300 new stickers.</li><li>Meta recently detailed an upcoming feature in testing for Instagram that lets users "reset" their feed recommendations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Before we get deep into the holidays, Instagram is detailing a few updates for its DM experience.</p><p>Headlining the updates today (Nov 26) is the ability for users to share their live location via DMs. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-instagram-dm-features-update">Newsroom post</a>, Instagram states you can share your location "privately" in one-on-one and group chat DM threads. The platform states your shared location in a chat will "disappear after one hour."</p><p>For the sender, users in Instagram's DMs will see a small map preview detailing where in the world they are. A blue "share your location" button will submit a snapshot preview of where you are alongside your profile icon in the chat. Others can tap the "View" button to see a map with specifics.</p><p>Instagram highlights a few security/privacy advisories, stating users will notice an "indicator" at the top of a chat thread, alerting them to their shared location. Moreover, users have the option to stop sharing where they are at any time. For peace of mind, Instagram states others in your chats <em>cannot </em>"forward" your location to another chat.</p><p>The ability to share your location via Instagram DMs is rolling out today (Nov 26); however, its usability is only available "in select countries."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="woHgKn6BjrTHRMTHX26psE" name="instagram-dms-share-location-update" alt="Instagram DMs now let users share their live location with others." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woHgKn6BjrTHRMTHX26psE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="601" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instagram's DMs are also picking up a new nickname feature. Users will be able to customize a unique, quirky name for their friends or for themselves. As the update appears, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.instagram.com/598851592468668/?cms_platform=android-app&helpref=platform_switcher">users are instructed</a> to tap on their DMs and enter a chat. Tapping the name at the top, whether it's a group or a one-on-one thread, will open the "Nicknames" page.</p><p>A full list of those within the thread will appear alongside the option to tap on each and enter a unique title. Instagram highlights the option for users to decide <em>who </em>can edit their nickname in DMs, too. The platform states this is defaulted to "those you follow," but you can change this with a couple of other choices.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that these nicknames will not appear anywhere else but in your DMs.</p><p>Lastly, Instagram's mid-week update brings more stickers. The post states users will soon notice 17 new sticker packs become available. In total, users should have around 300 new stickers to play with and send to friends or family. All three updates should begin rolling out today (Nov 26), but it might take a while before everyone sees it.</p><p>This update for DMs arrives six days after the platform discussed an upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-bringing-recommendations-reset-button">reset option for your feed</a>. The feature is wrapped in testing; however, Meta states that users will (in the future) have the option to reset their entire set of feed recommendations. The company states this will give a user a "fresh start" when viewing feeds, exploring tabs, and watching Reels.</p><p>Durning its test, Meta states this reset button is geared toward teens as their interests/tastes tend to change and evolve over time. The company states it wants to "give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience."</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a smart ring for tracking your activities and health without paying a premium for the latest model.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want to pay for a subscription or want the latest Oura Ring 4 for its improved health tracking.</p>
<p>When I first reviewed the Oura Ring Gen 3, I was already quite impressed with its capabilities. From its impressive sleep tracking to its week-long battery life, the Oura Ring Gen 3 became a staple in my life, not just for my physical health, but my mental health as well.</p><p>Even more impressive is the fact that Oura continues to add new features and capabilities to the app and ring, making this a long-term device that you don't really have to worry about upgrading every year, which is what helped make it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> we've reviewed. So even though the newer Oura Ring 4 is available, you can be sure that Oura will continue supporting the Gen 3 for as long as it can. That's what makes the smart ring worth looking at, even with Oura's low-cost $6/month subscription.</p><p>Oh, and if you're still on the fence, you should know that you can also use your FSA or HSA to purchase the ring, which could help you pull the trigger.</p>

<hr>
<p>New murmurings state Xiaomi is interested in dropping outside creators for its smartphone chip in 2025.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-26/xiaomi-readies-own-mobile-chip-pressuring-mediatek-and-qualcomm">Bloomberg</a>, the Chinese OEM is supposedly pursuing a future where it develops its SoCs in-house for its devices. The publication cites those close to the mater in saying Xiaomi could begin "mass production" of its personalized chipset in 2025.</p><p>The report highlights Xiaomi's close relationship with Qualcomm; however, this move to develop its own chip could help Xiaomi become "self-sufficient."</p><p>The company is reportedly interested in "reducing" its reliance on outside chip suppliers like Qualcomm and MediaTek. In working with Qualcomm, the publication states Xiaomi deployed certain additions on top of its chip like extra power management capabilities and "graphic enhancements."</p><p>However, branching out and developing a chip in-house would give Xiaomi the tools and leeway to create an SoC to its taste. Additionally, it seems this was expected of Xiaomi.

<p>Creating a custom chip would give an OEM everything it needs to develop the right chip for its phone — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">just like Google</a>. It was reported that the OEM was pursuing the idea of parting ways with Samsung's Semiconductors in favor of TSMC. This process was reportedly going to take a couple of years before consumers would see its affects in the next-generation of Pixels.</p><p>The project was originally supposed to start with project "Redondo," but difficulties caused it to crumble. What resulted was a slightly stronger Tensor G4. However, the true upgrade is expected to be the Tensor G4, codenamed "Laguna."</p><p>A Taiwanese report claimed Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">started testing its Tensor G5</a> chip ahead of its TSMC switch in January. It was then followed up by reports that said Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">finished designing</a> its (expected) 3nm process chip in July, which means it has the greenlight to kick start its production.</p><p>The publication alludes to the possibility of Xiaomi leaning on TSMC for the production of its chip. The Taiwanese company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tsmc-us-investigation-breakdown">involved in its own issues</a> at the moment. TSMC reportedly had several of its parts find their way into Huawei's Ascend 910B AI accelerator, which is an act the U.S. government <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huawei-devices-are-losing-support-for-android-apps-heres-why-its-a-good-thing">forbade them from doing</a>. Despite TSMC not knowing — and reporting what happened itself — there's a chance the U.S. could instruct companies within its boundaries to avoid contact with the Taiwanese OEM.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung finally brings mobile cloud gaming out of beta for North America.</li><li>The new feature allows users to stream mobile games via a hub instead of locally installing them on their Galaxy phone.</li><li>Users will be able to stream games featured within in-app ads, and games are streamed via the Galaxy store.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung finally announced the anticipated mobile cloud gaming platform for North America, moving it out of beta, which was released last year.</p><p>The announcement came through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-revolutionizes-mobile-gaming-commercialization-cloud-gaming-platform/">newsroom post</a> on the company’s website—spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/22/samsung-galaxy-cloud-gaming-apps/">9to5Google</a>—and is already live through Samsung Gaming Hub. In the post, Samsung describes the new platform as a means to play “full-fledged Android games” instantly without the need to download the game on your Galaxy device.</p>
<p>The aim is to make mobile gaming accessible, like streaming video, without the need to download the full game to the device. Samsung also notes that in addition to bringing such benefits to the players, it will also reduce latency and increase efficiency and scale for game publishers.</p><p>Samsung has also noted that during the beta phase of cloud gaming, the company has noticed “instant access to games dramatically increase user acquisition performance with a 50% conversion from initial click to game start,” which is believed to be a 10x improvement over the industry average.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.92%;"><img id="dhjxNB5qLqWNzHtCipnxrB" name="Samsung-Gaming-Hub-streaming" alt="Streaming on the Samsung Gaming Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dhjxNB5qLqWNzHtCipnxrB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2646" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“During the beta, cloud gaming on Galaxy devices also experienced substantial growth with a 149% increase in monthly active users year-over-year in the United States and Canada,” the company further mentioned in the aforementioned post.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, unlike other cloud gaming services where PC/console games are ported to mobile handsets, Samsung’s approach appears rather different as it focuses solely on mobile games you can already play on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">Galaxy phones</a>.</p><p>The publication further cites game titles in the Gaming Hub under the newly announced cloud mobile gaming, including Monopoly Go!, Homescapes, and Marvel Contest of Champions. To start playing, you can access these titles instantly through the Samsung Gaming Hub app.</p>
<p>The streaming of these games is believed to start instantaneously; however, there seems to be a drop in resolution compared to the downloaded title. Since cloud gaming allows multiple titles, the drop in resolution seems negligible at this point.</p><p>Users have to bear in mind that they should have a Samsung account to access the Gaming Hub and these titles. Lastly, these cloud gaming titles also worked on Galaxy Z Fold 6 foldable phone.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is seemingly facing legal battles and antitrust challenges on all fronts. The company had to make sweeping changes to its services in the European Union as a result of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>, and recently lost a case in the U.S. that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">ruled Google has a monopoly on search</a>. Meanwhile, closing arguments wrapped up this week in another antitrust case concerning Google's ad-tech business.</p><p>Google and the U.S. Department of Justice have two very different interpretations of how the trial went, the two sides made clear in closing arguments reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/technology/google-advertising-monopoly.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>. The case began last year when the federal government and a number of states filed a lawsuit claiming that Google's advertising business was a monopoly, deriving partially from its acquisition of Doubleclick, an advertising company, more than a decade ago.</p><p>Experts suggest that following Google's loss in its search monopoly case, another successful antitrust case against the big tech company would have massive implications for regulation. That's what Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will decide in the next few months, following closing arguments from the U.S. and Google regarding the company's ad-tech services.</p><p>"Google is once, twice, three times a monopolist," said Aaron Teitelbaum, who is a lawyer for the Justice Department. "These are the markets that make the free and open internet possible."</p><p>Google rejects that notion, claiming that its successful advertising business — which accounted for more than $31 billion in revenue in 2023 — is the result of a healthy market. Advertising represents a significant portion of Google's total revenue, about one-tenth's worth, and that's large for a company with a two-trillion-dollar market valuation.</p><p>"Google’s conduct is a story of innovation in response to competition," said Karen Dunn, the lead attorney for Google. Dunn added that "the law simply does not permit, and the evidence does not support" the claim that Google's ad-tech business is monopolistic, and said the DOJ's case ended up proving "the exact opposite."</p><p>Regardless of how Judge Brinkema rules in this case, Google as we know it appears destined to change. As a result of its loss in the separate search antitrust case, the DOJ is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">asking Google to sell Chrome</a> and make changes to Android. The process will take time, and Google has until Dec. 20 to provide a rebuttal. However, in the end, Google will look different.</p>

<ul><li>Users on Reddit have reported a new Fossil update for its Gen 6 watches rocking Android 11 (Wear OS 3.5).</li><li>The update appears quite minor as users report the new firmware version and that it rocks the April 2024 security patch.</li><li>In January, Fossil announced that it was bowing out of the smartwatch game; however, it stated it would continue to support its "existing" devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Your eyes aren't deceiving you, Fossil is rolling out a Wear OS update for users with its latest smartwatch.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzuxd5/fossil_gen_6_is_updating_bit_suprising_cause_i/">user on Reddit</a> posted a photo of their Fossil Gen 6 Venture downloading a new Wear OS update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/25/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-update/">9to5Google</a>). Several more users chimed in, stating they've also begun noticing the update appear on a Gen 6 watch. According to the publication, it seems users with a Gen 6 device will begin updating to version <strong>RFHF.240305.011</strong> today (Nov 26) or later this week.</p><p>The OP (original poster), a_blue_day, returned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzuxd5/comment/lyzt349/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">to their post</a> to state the update states it's based on Android 11 (Wear OS 3.5) and contains Google's April 2024 security update.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzuxd5/fossil_gen_6_is_updating_bit_suprising_cause_i">Fossil gen 6 is updating, bit suprising cause I thought they weren't going to do that anymore?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS">r/WearOS</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The users on Reddit haven't highlighted any patch notes, which could mean it's a generic blurb of text. Curiously, another thread on the WearOS subreddit claims the update <em>might've </em>altered the look of the AOD (always-on display) notifications. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzd68x/fossil_gen_6_update_nov_2024/">user states</a> the AOD displays notifications in a single line, but it could've just been something they overlooked in the past.</p><p>While one user spotted the update on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-venture-edition-announced">Fossil Gen 6 Venture</a>, it seems that others with a standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fossil-gen-6-review">Gen 6</a> are seeing it, too. Users with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-wellness-edition-review">Gen 6 Wellness Edition</a> should also check their devices for the latest update.</p><p>Some users aren't seeing the update at the same time, so continue to check your device as the week progresses.</p><p>While surprising, this update for Fossil's Gen 6 devices isn't <em>that </em>surprising. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">bowed out of the smartwatch game</a> in January 2024 but left some hope. During its announcement, the company stated its Gen 6 devices would be the last ones from its kitchen. However, a major catalyst for its Wear OS departure is the competition. The company stated the smartwatch market had "evolved significantly over the past few years."</p><p>Additionally, OEMs like Google and Samsung seemed to take off in ways Fossil struggled to keep up with. Though it's gone, Fossil said it would continue to update its <em>existing smartwatches </em>"for the next few years." The last update for the Gen 6 arrived last year with the August 2023 security patch, per users on Reddit.</p>

This latest research builds upon nearly a decade of similar research by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, one of the United States Department of Energy national laboratories.</p>

<p>LED lights that use Pulse Width Modulation, also known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, are causing the same health problems for people that old fluorescent lights used to because they are built on incorrect measurements. Many lights and displays are built with the idea that they shouldn't show visible strobing, but the latest research shows that visible strobing is only one piece of the puzzle.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14771535241288783">recently published</a> Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL) research focuses on LED lighting, the same characteristics can be seen on many smartphone displays.</p>

<p>I first began writing about these issues in May 2023 when I realized that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">my phone was making me sick</a>. As I researched further, I found that complaints spiked significantly when Apple released the iPhone X, the first iPhone that used Samsung AMOLED displays instead of LCD panels.</p><p>Since then, Samsung and Apple have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">improved the flicker frequency</a> of their displays to 480Hz, but those companies haven't gone far enough to address the real concerns. Research shows that this rate needs to be improved to <em>at least</em> 2400Hz, which is found on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a>, for example. Sure enough, when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">increased the Pixel 8 Pro's PWM rate by 20x</a>, I found that the eye strain previously caused by the display went away.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung, Google, and Apple all use PWM dimming at or below 480Hz, but research shows that they should be using at least 2400Hz to reduce negative health effects.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Companies like OnePlus and Motorola have gone one step further, though, swapping out potentially harmful PWM dimming with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-dc-dimming-on-the-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-12r">DC dimming</a>, which this research shows is substantially safer.</p><p>PNNL's latest research shows that not only is this the right move to make, but that continued use of low-Hz PWM by companies like Samsung, Google, and Apple will further exacerbate health problems caused by poor LED lighting design.</p><p>I interviewed PNNL's Naomi Miller, who has been a lighting expert and researcher for the last 40 years, to find out more about PNNL's work and the results of the latest research.</p>

<p>Many lights and displays come with a "flicker-free" sticker or certification on them these days, but the term doesn't mean the same thing to everyone. For many companies like Google, Samsung, and Apple, "flicker-free" simply means that your eyes cannot see the display rapidly turning on and off. Instead, you only see a brighter or dimmer display depending on how long the display stays powered on during each cycle.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 family</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">latest iPhones</a> all flicker at a rate of 480 times per second, or 480Hz. Meanwhile, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> runs at 240Hz, or half that of Samsung and Apple. All of these companies can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dxomark.com/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-display-test/">claim to be flicker-free</a> because few people can perceive flicker happening at this frequency, although what you see and what's actually happening are two completely different things.</p><p>These companies measure flicker by using the stroboscopic effect which quite literally means "can your eye see this light flickering." Most people cannot see flickering past 100Hz, which is why lightbulbs operated at 100-120Hz for decades.</p><p>But many flicker standards are based on lights that don't turn <strong>completely</strong> on or off the way an LED does. Instead, they were often based on incandescent bulbs which use a heated filament to generate light. This filament never completely turns off during a normal 120Hz cycle so its light is incredibly smooth looking. If you measure this on a graph, it looks like a Sine wave that you probably remember from high school math class.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Research shows that many LED lights and OLED displays were built with the wrong flicker measurements in mind.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The light-emitting diodes (LED) in a modern AMOLED display from Samsung attempt to replicate the same effect but have one big problem: an LED turns <em>completely off </em>during this cycle, which makes the difference between the on and off segments substantially harsher than with an incandescent bulb or even most LCD panels. If you measure this on a graph, it looks like a series of rectangles with high peaks and low valleys.</p><p>Miller says PNNL's research shows that visibility of the stroboscopic effect using LED lights plummets after 250Hz, with almost no one being able to see the effect beyond 750Hz. However, instead of measuring visible flicker from a static light source, PNNL's research shows that companies need to use the phantom array effect instead.</p><p>PNNL defines the phantom array effect as "a series of repeated images that may be perceived when a person moves their eyes in large saccades across a light source that is modulating in output over time." In plain English, it's the strange strobing effect you can sometimes see when washing your hands in a restaurant or when driving behind a car that has bright LED brake lights.</p>

<p>PNNL's latest study evaluated the sensitivity and "annoyance factor" against 85 unique light waveforms generated by a single LED bulb against a black background. The study group included a range of age groups, genders, and folks who are both prone to migraines and those without a history of migraines.</p><p>Per the study's abstract, folks prone to migraines were able to see the phantom array effect (light flicker) more often than those without a history of migraines. Ironically, this same group didn't report having seen the effect more often in everyday life than the non-migraine group but did report a higher level of sensitivity to it when it occurred.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As many as 64% of participants cited headaches, eye fatigue, and disorientation after being exposed to common flickering LED lights.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>PNNL studied several participant responses, including a "mean annoyance rating," which was defined as a response "on a scale from 0 (not annoying at all) to 8 (extremely annoying, I need to leave the room)."</p><p>Of the 85 waveforms shown to people, 50 were a sinewave pattern, 28 were rectangular, six were complex, and one was DC-dimmed. Dialing down into the specifics, the waveform that's closest to the most popular phones available — that's a rectangular shape, 100% modulation, and 400Hz PWM — averaged a 4.8 mean annoyance rating.</p><p>The only other waveform on the list of 85 that produced a higher mean annoyance rating was a 120Hz rectangular wave — which produced a 4.9 mean annoyance rating — and would not likely be seen in the real world outside of the very worst types of LED bulbs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="czVPiHXu86SYmJXWjacavR" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-7.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL next to iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/czVPiHXu86SYmJXWjacavR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The type of light that comes from the most popular smartphone displays ranked #2 in the worst types of artificial light produced by LEDs.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Dialing down the list, a phone like the Vivo X100 Pro — which uses a 2400Hz PWM display with very low modulation — only shows up at a 1.0 mean annoyance rating. DC-dimmed lights and displays sit at a very comfortable 0.6 mean annoyance rating.</p><p>There's a reason most phones from brands like OnePlus, Honor, Xiaomi Vivo, Oppo, and many others have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">heavily marketing</a> that they're using DC dimming or very high PWM rates. They're ahead of the curve, and it's time Samsung, Google, and Apple catch up.</p><p>The study shows that up to 64% of migraine-prone participants experienced headaches, eye fatigue, or disorientation during or after the test. Meanwhile, the number of non-migraine sufferers that experienced these symptoms was much smaller — about 17% — but the fact that this isn't attributed only to folks with migraine sensitivity is a landmark finding.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Will Apple, Google, and Samsung will do the responsible thing and follow the science, or will they continue the current path of deprioritizing long-term human health over less important metrics?</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As more and more LEDs become pervasive in our world, it's becoming increasingly important for manufacturers to pay attention to studies like these. It's impossible to get away from LED lighting these days, and having devices all around that can cause ill health effects only further exacerbates the problem.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/ssl-tan-etal-2024-lrt_tlm.pdf">previous research backs up</a>, negative health effects significantly diminish as PWM frequency increases. Will Apple, Google, and Samsung will do the responsible thing and follow the science, or will they continue the current path of deprioritizing long-term human health over less important metrics?</p><p>Until then, the best thing to do to guard your health is to buy phones from other brands. I've long recommended the OnePlus 12 as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> for many reasons, but its display is one of the most important for your long-term health. If you're in the U.S., brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-motorola-deals-2024-historic-razr-savings-usd150-off-moto-g-stylus-and-more">Motorola</a>, Nothing, and CMF are all excellent choices for eye health, too.</p>

Buy the Samsung Galaxy S24 alongside one year of Mint Mobile&apos;s Unlimited plan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s24/5418243/"><strong>you&apos;ll get $180 off your purchase</strong></a>, effectively making the full 12 months of wireless service 100% free. </p><p>The plan in question is no drag, either: it&apos;s actually one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a> we&apos;ve ever used, with unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s legendary 5G network, talk and text to Mexico and Canada, and 10GB of free mobile hotspot data every month. Yes, the Unlimited plan is capped at 40GB before data starts to slow, but again, it&apos;s free, so unless you&apos;re a heavy data user, it&apos;s a pretty incredible opportunity. </p>

<ul><li>Google has started rolling out its Spotify extension for Gemini users on Android.</li><li>Under the "Play & Search" moniker, users can ask Gemini to discover music based on artist, song title, playlist, or lyrics.</li><li>The feature echoes what Google rolled out for Gemini users earlier this year for YouTube Music.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted pushing a long-awaited extension for its AI model that might help out your tunes.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/26/spotify-gemini-extension/">9to5Google</a>, the company is now rolling out a Gemini extension that lets users pair their Spotify accounts with the model. The publication states that it has yet to appear properly in the AI's list of extensions; however, Google is already detailing its full functionality.</p><p>On a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15300097">support page</a>, Google highlights the extension's "Play & Search" feature, which is its primary means of assistance. The post prefaces the rollout, stating Gemini's Spotify extension will only work if its settings are "set to English." More importantly, users must connect their Spotify Premium account by first linking it to their desired Google account.</p><p>Once connected, the post states users can begin instructing the AI to play music. Users have the following Gemini commands:</p>
<ul><li>Play [album name] on Spotify</li><li>Play [song name] by [artist name] on Spotify</li><li>Play my Spotify playlist called [playlist name]</li><li>Play music for [activity] on Spotify</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF" name="Spotify-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Spotify Premium on an Android phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, the support page highlights the ability to have Gemini "search" for music. Users can sift through Spotify's wide selection of playlists by asking Gemini to run a search based on "genre, mood, and activity." Similarly, users can ask the AI model to find songs based on a particular artist.</p><p>For times when you know the lyrics but not the song, Google says Gemini can search based on the words. If you're searching based on lyrics, the post states users must begin with "Search for the song that goes..." and enter the words right after.</p><p>As always, users have control over the Spotify extension, meaning they can disable it (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/extensions">within the settings</a>) or unlink their account. There are a few advisories, such as Gemini's Spotify extension not working with the AI's web app, Messages, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-on-iphone-dedicated-app-launch">Gemini on iPhone</a>. Via Android, the company states users can even voice their commands to Gemini by starting with "Hey Google."</p><p>The update is slowly rolling out today (Nov 26), so it may take the rest of the day or the next few days before you see it.</p><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-inner-workings-code">been expecting</a> Gemini's Spotify extension for a while now, but it essentially echoes the YouTube Music variant. In May, Google rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">YouTube Music extension</a> for its Android <em>and </em>desktop users. The add-on lets users search for playlists, genres, songs, and more. Moreover, the YouTube Music version lets users discover radios based on genre. This is something Google states the Spotify version doesn't offer.</p><p>As noted by the publication, Google is also working to bring a few more extensions to Gemini. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13695044#zippy=%2Cexamples%2Cabout-your-youtube-music-watch-history:~:text=Communication%20extensions%3A">support page highlights</a> the existence of a Messages, WhatsApp, and Phone extension, though they haven't rolled out officially yet.</p>
