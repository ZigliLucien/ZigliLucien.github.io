<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Early adopters in the U.S. are starting to get access to Google Photos' "Ask Photos" feature, with reports that the rollout is already happening for some.</li><li>The AI search is currently limited to a select group of users but works across all versions of Google Photos since it’s server-side.</li><li>It replaces the current Search tab, but you still need to kick off searches through Ask Photos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Photos is rolling out a Gemini-powered update that could totally take over how you remember your life’s moments.</p><p>In May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini">Google introduced "Ask Photos,"</a> a new feature in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> powered by Gemini AI. It lets you search for specific images just by asking in plain language, revamping how you browse your photo collection.</p><p>Now, it looks like early adopters are getting access to the feature now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/05/google-ask-photos-ai-rolling-out/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reporting that Ask Photos is already rolling out to a lucky few.</p><p>Right now, though, the AI-powered search feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">available to a limited group of U.S. users from the waitlist</a>. Apparently, it&apos;s rolled out on the server side, so it works regardless of the version of Google Photos you&apos;re using.</p><p>As the name hints, Ask Photos lets you use descriptive queries to find specific photos and videos in your collection, leading to more precise search results. Thanks to Google’s Gemini AI, this feature picks up on the context of images in your gallery, including details like people and food preferences.</p><p>Ask Photos essentially supplants the current Search tab in the app&apos;s bottom bar. Once you give Google access to the required data, this feature will work smoothly with Photos on all your devices. While the classic search option will still be available, you’ll need to kick things off with Ask Photos to use it.</p><p>Though it’s mainly built for questions about people, Ask Photos also serves as a handy travel buddy. It taps into your visual history to help remember important details like hotel names and license plates. For instance, it can pinpoint where you took those camping gear photos or even recognize dishes from your restaurant snaps.</p><p>Besides answering your questions, Google previously mentioned that Ask Photos can help with various tasks, like creating a quick recap of your latest vacation or picking the best family photos for a shared album.</p><p>Google Photos has come a long way from just being a simple photo organizer to becoming a smart AI-powered memory hub. With the launch of &apos;Ask Photos,&apos; the search features have taken a big leap forward. While this new feature is great for lots of users, some folks might find it a bit too nosy for their liking.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Judge James Donato <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-legal-setback-could-open-the-door-for-more-app-stores-on-android">has ruled</a> that Google will be forced to allow third-party app stores to be tied to Google Play as part of the remedy for its anticompetitive practices.</p><p>This is the "penalty" phase of the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-vs-google-antitrust-witness-list">Epic v. Google trial</a> from 2020, where Google was found to be an illegal monopoly concerning how it regulates the Play Store and its policies towards developers.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a list of things Judge Donato has ordered Google to do regarding its billing requirements and payment policies, but the headline is, of course, about how Epic has cracked the Play Store open. </p><p>Some of what Google must change is great, including things it never should have done it in the first place. Some of what&apos;s in the order is unfair to Google (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing">Donato has stated</a> he is willing to make Google financially suffer as a punishment), and some of it will never happen. As of right now, nobody knows which part is which. Google has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">started the appeal process</a>, as expected.</p><p>Anyone who has any predictions is speculating. An appeals court could toss the whole thing. It probably won&apos;t, but like everyone else, I have some predictions of my own.</p>
<p>Everything in regard to how Google treats third-party payments is going to stay as ordered. And it should. It&apos;s unfair for Google to not allow a developer to tell you how you can close the Play Store, visit a website, make a purchase, and enter a code inside an app. Google wants this because it wants 30% of the money involved. (hint — you can do this for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> and save money, too)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "opening of the Play Store" <strong>can&apos;t</strong> work as described. As ordered, Google must allow Epic (for example) to put the Epic Games store app in Google Play, have access to every app on the store, and collect payments without going through Google <strong>unless a developer opts out of this process</strong>. It sounds good and is certainly a way to make Google pay for its sins, but it&apos;s a technical nightmare that will never work as described.</p><p>Some of this ruling shouldn&apos;t stand — Google <em>should</em> be allowed to compensate developers for exclusive access the same way Microsoft, Sony, Apple, and Epic Games do. But these are the small potatoes stuff compared to Google being forced to grant Play Store access to any third party for three years.</p>
<p>Of course, you&apos;re going to see a lot of people mention Apple. It&apos;s the low-hanging fruit because it can get away with doing the same things Google is in trouble over. Even Google is talking about Apple in its blog post, telling the world how unfair this ruling is.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen a lot of explanations about how Apple was able to get away with it. Apple is not a monopoly. Apple never said it was open. Apple doesn&apos;t license its software. Probably all valid points, but the best explanation I&apos;ve heard is, "<em>Apple had a different judge</em>."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.30%;"><img id="nrUC9Mp4DMWEN5wKimsuvM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-magic-eraser-apple-store-after.jpg" alt="Magic Eraser - Apple Store - After" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrUC9Mp4DMWEN5wKimsuvM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s important to remember. Judges, even district court judges, are very qualified arbiters of the law (usually). But a Master&apos;s Degree in the Arts and a law school degree from even the best school doesn&apos;t mean you understand tech. They do their best and sometimes it works. Other times, it doesn&apos;t.</p>
<p>We knew this was coming, and Donato&apos;s demeanor towards Google meant that this wasn&apos;t a big surprise. We&apos;re also set to hear <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-v-google-there-are-no-good-guys">yet another case</a> from Epic against Google and Samsung and will likely keep seeing them until Epic can get what it wants.</p><p>In the meantime, expect this one to be the same as Epic v. Apple was: a long, drawn-out appeal with a final ruling that doesn&apos;t have the same bite to it as the original did. Either way, Google and Epic are both going to be fine and still able to grow their wealth.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has been ordered to share its entire app catalog with rival app stores and promote those third-party app marketplaces on the Play Store.</p><p>In a landmark decision, U.S. District Judge James Donato has ordered Google to loosen its hold on the Android app ecosystem. The court says Google must allow competitors into its app store for the next three years and make it easier for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> to be available through other app stores (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>Epic Games&apos; victory means Google must now share its app library with other app stores and even promote them. This ruling wraps up a four-year antitrust showdown between the two.</p><p>The injunction requires the search giant to make it easier for users to install rival app stores right from the Play Store. Plus, Google has to allow third-party app stores to distribute apps from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a> unless developers choose to opt out.</p><p>Google is also prevented from doing things that could hinder competition, like paying companies to avoid challenging its app store dominance. Also, Google can’t make deals that require its app store to be preinstalled on new devices.</p><p>Further, the injunctions tackle Google’s old rule that forced developers to use Google Pay Billing for app sales in the Play Store. That requirement is now gone, allowing developers to offer other payment options that bypass Google’s revenue-sharing model.</p><p>App developers can now include links to other installation options right in their apps, making it easier for users to choose how they download and install software. They can also share information about different ways to make purchases.</p><p>A three-person committee will be set up to keep an eye on how well Google follows the court’s injunctions and tackle any tech issues that pop up. This team will include representatives from both Google and Epic Games.</p><p>Google has to stick to these changes for three years starting November 1, 2024. However, Alphabet plans to appeal the rulings, with Google&apos;s VP for regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" target="_blank">citing</a> competition from Apple and security issues. This could push back major changes to Google’s business practices by several months or even years.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Mountain View-based company can still charge fees for necessary measures to protect user safety and security for apps from Google Play.</p><p>The court&apos;s ruling is a major milestone that could set a precedent for future antitrust cases against Google. It’s part of a larger wave of lawsuits aimed at the company&apos;s monopolistic practices, highlighting the ongoing push for competition and consumer welfare in the digital marketplace.</p><p>The latest ruling follows a similar case from December, where a jury <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">unanimously agreed that the Play Store and Google Play Billing service were illegal monopolies</a>. They also found that various deals between Google, game developers, and phone manufacturers amounted to anticompetitive behavior.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s latest entry to its cheaper Android phone segment is getting a flagship-level treat that might make you swoon.</p><p>The Korean OEM&apos;s latest A-series phone, the Galaxy A16 5G, has seemingly received a quiet launch as it appeared on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/nl/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a16-5g-blue-black-128gb-sm-a166bzkdeub/">Dutch website</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidplanet.nl/nieuws/samsung-galaxy-a16-officieel/">Android Planet</a>). This is the company&apos;s next iteration following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-listed-on-walmart">A15 5G</a>, which debuted in November 2023. The device takes this further with a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Similar to its predecessor, the Galaxy A16 5G sports a triple camera array, consisting of a 50MP primary lens, a 5MP ultrawide, and a 2MP macro camera. The selfie camera arrives at 13MP.</p><p>The internal processing and software of the A16 5G are turning heads as Samsung states it features an improved Octa-Core processor with 2.4GHz. More importantly, the device runs Android 14 with the promise of delivering six years of OS updates to consumers who purchase the device.</p><p>Samsung states on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/nl/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a16-5g-blue-black-128gb-sm-a166bzkdeub/">website</a> that the A16 5G is "future-proof" as users can grab six generations of major Android OS updates <em>and </em>security updates. Those who grab the 2024 budget device can expect updates until October 31, 2030 — if it&apos;s still in your pocket. It&apos;s worth mentioning that Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series observed seven years of Android OS updates and security patches.</p>

<p>Other internal specifications include the device&apos;s 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The company advises that only 109.3GB of that 128 number is "available." Additionally, the A16 5G has a microSD card slot with support of up to 1.5TB.</p><p>The battery remains unchanged as Samsung provides a 5,000mAh capacity brick with 25W charging. The company estimates this should give consumers around 16 hours of Wi-Fi and roughly 18 hours of video playback.</p><p>In the Netherlands, the Galaxy A16 5G arrives in dark blue, light green, and light gray. It seems there&apos;s also a gold hue available, but appears restricted to another unspecified region. Samsung&apos;s Dutch website states the device can be purchased for € 229, which is roughly $250. Unfortunately, the company has yet to debut the budget device in the United States nor has it officially declared its price.</p><p>The A16 5G is truly a "budget" device, much more so than Samsung&apos;s recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">Galaxy S24 FE</a> from September. What&apos;s more, we&apos;re still waiting on Android 15 (One UI 7), which will be the latest budget phone&apos;s first major OS update. Samsung confirmed the update will roll out in 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 series. However, those interested can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">check out this demo</a> showcased on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a> at SDC 2024.</p>

<p><em><strong>Larry asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Hi Jerry!</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>What is the actual difference between cheap earbuds and allegedly better brands like Sony and Apple?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I admit my hearing is no longer the best, but I can&apos;t tell the difference. My cheap wireless buds are quite reliable, pair well, and hold a charge. Why pay $200.00 for name brands?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Heya Larry! I have a confession to make here, and I want to start with it — I&apos;m a sucker for any discussion about headphones. I work with mobile tech for a living, but headphones are my one true hobby that eats every bit of extra cash I have, so I was super happy to see this question come into my inbox. :)</p><p>With so many different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">brands of wireless earbuds</a> to choose from at every imaginable price point, this is an important question. Not everyone wants (or can afford) to spend a lot of money on them, but there are some very real differences. These may make a difference to some people. I think of three places where a more expensive brand can differentiate itself: sound, features, and comfort.</p>

<p>It&apos;s tough to make a pair of earbuds that sound great because everything is so little inside of them, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-why-is-bluetooth-bad">Bluetooth can be a mixed bag</a> to begin with. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wired-earbuds-are-making-a-comeback-and-im-excited">wired earbuds</a>, and some of them sound absolutely incredible, but those are for another article. I&apos;m talking about wireless Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>More expensive sets will probably use better quality drivers with more range between the highs and lows. Our ears can hear very small differences in frequency (especially when we&apos;re young) so being able to cover a broader range can make a big impact in what we hear. The quality differences in miniature parts can be quite dramatic. While the differences in sound quality aren&apos;t as apparent to you, for many, they are. Higher prices come with better audio quality because the parts are more expensive and the design costs are higher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FdnSbvNWPZ6KB2uTG8YLnA" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-buds-compared.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdnSbvNWPZ6KB2uTG8YLnA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another big difference can be the "extra" features. Things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">noise cancellation</a> and audio passthrough are relatively expensive additions that require extra hardware and added design costs. Other brands go a step further and add specialized buttons or logic to work with voice controls. To top it off, none of this should interfere with the audio quality.</p><p>When you add up the few extra dollars here and there, then bundle all the costs associated with adding the features, getting them to work as intended, and then testing it all, the retail prices rise. Personally, I don&apos;t need the features you would find in something like the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/are-airpods-good-earbud-choice-android-users">AirPods</a>, but a lot of people find them indispensable and don&apos;t mind paying extra for them.</p>
<p>Finally — and I think this is important to <em>everyone</em> — you want your earbuds to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ultimate-ears-fits-review">a comfortable fit</a> that stays in place. We&apos;ve all had a pair of earbuds that kept popping out, and it can be infuriating, especially when your hands are full or you&apos;re exercising.</p><p>A lot of thought goes into a good design that works for most people, but it still never works for everyone. Proper fit also affects sound quality as earbuds are engineered so that the driver is a specific distance away from the inner ear workings.</p><p>There are plenty of different ways a company can try to ensure a proper fit, like including multiple sets of tips or using a hooked-over ear design, but there is still plenty of design work involved. I think this is the most important feature of any headphones and I&apos;m willing to pay extra for a pair that fits "just right" and plenty of people agree with me.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like you&apos;re lucky — you found a pair of cheap earbuds that work great for you. I&apos;d suggest you splurge for an extra pair in case you lose them and can&apos;t find them for sale later! I used to have an old pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/soundcores-discounted-liberty-air-2-true-wireless-earbuds-are-affordable-alternative-airpods">Soundcore</a> earbuds that weren&apos;t very expensive and I loved them. I found out they stopped making them after I dropped one of the pair into Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>No earbuds are best for everyone, and some people will spend more than others on them. Once you&apos;ve found a set that works for you, make sure to try and buy something very similar when it&apos;s time to replace them. And try not to drop them in the ocean!</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly rolling out several new features for Android under the "Theft Detection" moniker.</li><li>The updates include "Theft Detection Lock," which is an AI-powered lock screen that seeks out motion akin to someone snatching and running off with your device.</li><li>Offline Lock gives users remote control over their device if it's stolen and Offline Lock is a useful backup if a thief shuts off your phone's Wi-Fi or cell signal for too long.</li><li>Google previously teased these features during I/O 2024 alongside several more security measures in the works, like "Private Spaces" for Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports suggest that Google is starting to roll out some new security features for Android, which were teased during I/O 2024.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1842388241410146359">Mishaal Rahman on X</a> states Google has started pushing three new Theft Protection features: Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and Remote Lock. The features were originally spotted on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro</a> in the U.S., but additional reports by other users claim Google&apos;s pushed the security enhancements globally. </p><p>Google highlighted several features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">to safeguard user data</a> and sensitive information on Android in May. The company wrapped the new tools under a "Theft Protection" banner, which included the AI-powered screen lock known as "Detection Lock." Google stated during I/O 2024 that, when enabled, this feature would look for motions akin to someone snatching your device and running off.</p><p>If your phone detects this, it will lock itself for protection.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These three features actually appear to be rolling out globally, judging by all the replies I've received! https://t.co/IAj8NLcST0<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1842567056505688435">October 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Remote Lock is similar; however, this version lets users lock their phone (you guessed it) remotely. The initial announcement stated that users would need their phone number to complete this, as well as the completion of a security challenge. Devices running Android 10 and newer are eligible to receive this feature.</p><p>Rounding out the update is "Offline Lock." Malicious persons who&apos;ve taken your device offline (Wi-Fi, cell data) for a "prolonged" time will lose access to the phone. Moreover, if they attempt to guess your password and fail too many times enables further locking parameters. Android 10 and newer devices are eligible for this feature.</p><p>Users have noticed these features in India, Germany, and the EU alongside the U.S. However, it&apos;s worth noting that some users have not seen all three features in various regions, likely indicating Google&apos;s continuous rollout.</p><p>The other side of that major security post from May was "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a>." This secluded area on your device functions similarly to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/files-google-gets-pin-protected-safe-folder-hide-your-personal-files">Safe Folder</a>. Inbound for Android 15, users can set up a Private Space on their phone to hide away apps with sensitive information (like health and banking) behind a unique PIN. Elsewhere, Google stated it was looking into safeguarding your one-time passwords.</p><p>The company teased it was working on bolstering its Android fraud protections and expanding the software&apos;s Restricted Settings.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re due for our yearly Qualcomm Summit, but this leak isn&apos;t passing us by as new information surfaces about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4.</p><p>The alleged specification sheet for the upcoming flagship SoC was highlighted on X by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1842789635707285562">Jukanlosreve</a> as it appeared on Baidu (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-gen-4-massive-specifications-sheet-components-layout-leaked/">WCCFTech</a>). The screenshots provided show that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 may arrive in two variants: SM8750 and SM8750P. The primary difference (so far) is that the former is the only one to support both mmWave and sub-6 5G.</p><p>Graphically, the leaks claim the SoC will be paired with the Adreno 8-series GPU. The alleged sheet states it&apos;ll support displays up to 3,840x2,560 resolution at a max 144Hz refresh rate. Display processing rumors add that it&apos;ll include HDR10/10+, HDR Vivid, Dolby Vision HDR, and FP16 blending support.</p><p>The publication noted that the sheet suggests the SD 8 Gen 4 will support "the older" LPDDR5X RAM standard instead of the previously assumed LPDDR6. Moreover, the flagship chip will supposedly bring swift memory writing speeds to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> storage support. The screenshots purport users and OEMs may experience 4,500MB reading and 4,000MB writing speeds.</p><p>AI was the name of the game during Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC launch and it seems like that&apos;s continuing this year. Aside from the already confirmed use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Oryon CPU</a>, the leaked specs state the "Hexagon Tensor Processor" will provide some "AI use cases." Such uses are said to be generative AI, noise reduction, super-resolution, image enhancement, and more.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the spec sheets for the 8G4 have been leaked.https://t.co/ibBsIJ444C<a href="https://twitter.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1842789635707285562">October 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>SD 8 Gen 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">rumors have swirled</a> for a while, especially those suggesting it&apos;ll clock out at 4.0GHz with those Oryon CPU cores. Those same rumors claimed the chip would be paired with (specifically) the Adreno 830 GPU, which we&apos;ve seen doubled down in the latest alleged spec sheet. The SoC reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">appeared for its benchmark test</a> in February and seriously laid down the rubber.</p><p>From the test, it was rumored that the Adreno GPU hit a strength higher than Apple&apos;s M2.</p><p>Other rumors theorize that the SoC will see the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">Snapdragon X80 5G </a>Modem-RF system for communication purposes. The latest seventh-generation will, of course, provide 5G capabilities, but also satellite communication as more devices adopt the useful safety feature.</p><p>We won&apos;t have to wait that much longer as Qualcomm confirmed its Summit would occur in October. That event will hold the debut of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 as we await the next-generation of flagship phones to sport it.</p>

<hr>
<p>A OnePlus executive has confirmed the OnePlus 13 will have magnetic wireless charging, potentially making it the first Android flagship with a MagSafe-like feature.</p><p>OnePlus President and COO, Kinder Liu, recently shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/OAgy2rHBn?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a> screenshot of a chat where a fan asked if bamboo cases will make a comeback for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13-confirmed-to-have-magnetic-wireless-charging.898092.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p><p>Liu made it clear that there are no plans at the moment to bring back bamboo cases for the upcoming flagship model. However, he did confirm that wood-grain finish covers will be available, and they’ll feature a "magnetic suction function," hinting at the OnePlus 13&apos;s support for magnetic wireless charging.</p><p>The new OnePlus feature can be seen as the company&apos;s take on Apple&apos;s MagSafe, which has been a staple on iPhones since the iPhone 12 series. While MagSafe started as an Apple-only feature, the new open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2 charging standard</a>, co-developed by Apple, now opens the door for any brand to implement magnetic wireless charging. This is made possible by the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP), which takes cues from Apple’s MagSafe design.</p><p>MagSafe and the Qi2 standard have brought a fresh perspective to wireless charging, making it more versatile and functional. Yet, even with these improvements, the adoption of Qi2 among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">popular Android phones</a> remains relatively low.</p><p>Even with a surge of Qi2 accessories available today, the HMD Skyline stands out as the only (mid-range) Android smartphone to fully embrace this technology. Nevertheless, it&apos;s not yet clear if the OnePlus 13 will actually support the Qi2 standard.</p><p>The OnePlus 13&apos;s magnetic charging isn’t a huge surprise, especially since its sister brand, OPPO, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-magnetic-charging-leaked-camera-module">rolling out similar tech in the upcoming Find X8 series</a>. OPPO is also working on various magnetic accessories, like a portable power bank. This means OnePlus 13 users can look forward to an ecosystem that opens up even more charging options.</p><p>Reputable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OtA9SiGzE" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a> previously shared that OnePlus was developing magnetic cases with wireless charging for the OnePlus 13. There are also rumors about a magnetic snap-on cooling accessory to help with heat dissipation.</p><p>However, the leaker mentioned that these devices might not support "true magnetic wireless charging" because of patent limitations, likely tied to Apple&apos;s MagSafe patents.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is expected to launch in China later this year, possibly around late October. However, the global market will probably have to wait until next year for its release, following the trend of previous models.</p>
