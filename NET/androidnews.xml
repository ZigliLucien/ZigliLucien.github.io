<ul><li>A rumor claims that Samsung may bring A/B update support for its Galaxy S25 series, making it the first flagship to do so.</li><li>The Galaxy A55 supports seamless updates, meaning users can continue to use their device while an update is downloaded on a separate partition.</li><li>Samsung's VP claimed in 2022 that the company wanted to do so for One UI 6; however, reality shows that it didn't happen.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung's next flagship series is rumored to adopt a new update method that Google pushed for with Android earlier this year.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1852203187975131597">Chunvn8888</a> posted on X that Samsung's Galaxy S25 series could receive support for Android's A/B update method (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-seamless-updates-leak-3496340/">Android Authority</a>). This is good news considering Samsung's flagship series has consistently ignored this new update method.</p><p>The tipster notes that the only Samsung phone to receive A/B support is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A55</a>, which launched in March.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QqEiJpvBnkhzVMDbGydkNi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-display-home-screen-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QqEiJpvBnkhzVMDbGydkNi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In February, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-may-only-support-seamless-updates">pushed <em>all </em>OEMs</a> to adopt the A/B (seamless) update method on Android. It was discovered in the AOSP that the company planned to remove support for non-A/B updates. This was seen as the (hopeful) nudge Samsung needed to bring A/B support to its flagships â€” and it might work.</p><p>If the rumors are true, Galaxy S25 users can continue using their device as it updates using a separate partition. An active partition runs in the background, grabbing the update's information before slotting it into an <em>inactive </em>partition. This is done without disrupting the user's activities.</p><p>However, once completed, the prompt to restart appears, and the device will briefly refresh as it switches to that once-inactive partition with the update.</p><p>Take this rumor cautiously as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-working-on-seamless-updates-one-ui-6">Samsung's VP once claimed</a> the company wanted to introduce the A/B method for devices through One UI 6. It's unclear what the hang-up was, but reality shows that the Galaxy S23 <em>did not </em>debut with seamless updates.</p><p>What's more, Google implemented a fix for its seamless updates last year, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-phones-system-updates-install-now-faster">made them much faster</a>. Regardless, Samsung confirmed during its Q3 2024 earnings call that it plans to launch the Galaxy S25 series "in the first half of next year." With that, the company plans to continue to innovate and upgrade its on-device Galaxy AI experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly rolling out an update for Pixel Screenshots that cleans up its UI experience across multiple levels.</p><p>The company is rolling out a major change to its Pixel Screenshots UI on its home screen that drops the "All Screenshots" section. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/04/pixel-screenshots-update/">9to5Google</a>, the update (v0.24.373.08) promotes better organization and clarity when searching your saved photos. The publication notes that with the "All Screenshots" portion gone, the home screen receives horizontal organization via four, three, or two block rows.</p><p>Each option (from four to two) offers an increasingly larger preview window for the screenshot.</p><p>Following this update, users tapping on a screenshot will notice a vastly condensed details page. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> uses AI-generated descriptions to describe what the photo entails and other important details for rediscovery. The app can also save crucial dates to your Google Calendar if enabled. However, the post states this update makes these details smaller in an expandable box. The publication notes that this was likely done to give users quicker access to its notes and "add to collection" fields.</p><p>This change will likely aid users in taking screenshots <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9#:~:text=I%20tend%20to%20take%20screenshots%20of%20billing%20details">of billing information</a> or longer pieces of important text.</p>

<p>The update includes an option for users to long-press the Pixel Screenshots app icon with options to "take a photo" or "add image" from your phone's home screen.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post notes that Collections now display a "+" icon, the new button for adding screenshots. This replaces the old "select screenshots" option that would fit horizontally at the top of a Collection. Additionally, the old trash icon is gone, replaced by a vertical three-dot menu with the edit and delete buttons inside.</p><p>The publication states these updates are rolling out to more devices.</p><p>The Pixel Screenshots app was recently rumored to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-screenshots-circle-to-search-development-spotted">pick up closer integration</a> with Circle to Search. The latter lets users circle or highlight an area that they want the AI to search for through Google Search. However, a recent APK teardown showed the company might let users "save" those highlights to Pixel Screenshots. An early splash page states "Remember what you find. Save to Screenshots."</p><p>Google's October feature drop held an update for Pixel Screenshots that introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">its Gemini extension</a>. Users could say "Hey Google" and instruct it to use their collection of screenshots to find information about a specific brand of shoe and more. Once it finds the answer, the company explains that the AI will display the screenshot.</p>

<p>Amazon launched several updated Kindles in mid-October and among them is its first full-color e-reader, which has hit a snag.</p><p>Over the weekend, Amazon reportedly informed customers who purchased the Kindle Colorsoft that its delivery would be suspended. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-shipping-is-cancelled">GoodEReader</a>, the company is delaying all shipments of its color e-reader by "a week or more."

<p>Amazon launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">the Kindle Colorsoft</a> on October 16 alongside the new Kindle Scribe, Paperwhite, and base model.

<p><em><strong>Chris asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Is there anything I can do to get better battery life on my Galaxy Watch 6? I hate that it needs charging before the end of the day or when I'm not at home.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Chris. Great choice in a watch â€” my wife buys last year's Galaxy Watch model every year and saves a bunch of money while still having something that is new for her. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is really nice.</p><p>She also has to charge it every day around dinnertime because it just can't seem to keep up with her all day long. There is some good news, though: you can shut off or not use in order to get the most out of the battery.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is that your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> is a small, wearable, power-hungry computer with a tiny power source. Super-long battery life is never going to be a thing with a smartwatch and the best we should expect is for it to last between regular charge cycles. What I mean is that you should expect to charge your watch at the same time every day and it should last that long every day, regardless of what you were doing.</p><p>And from what I see, we're mostly there. Not counting the random days when something gets "stuck" running and eats your battery or days where it's counting a bajillion steps because you're at Disney World, you probably only have to charge it once per day. You shouldn't expect more from the current generation of technology inside of them. One day it will change, but we're not there yet.</p><p>The other thing to remember is that the more you do, the sooner your battery will die. Take my watch â€” a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">Garmin Venu 3</a> â€” as an example. I get four days or more between charges but Garmin watches aren't the same as a WearOS watch and other than fitness tracking they really fall behind when it comes to the "smart" stuff. An old Casio watch that only tells time gets about 10 years of life from a battery. Your Galaxy Watch can do all sorts of things that will eat your battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kDYqMi4ND2BWE6ELFWo3Hb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-hands-on-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch on a charging stand at the Google Fall 2022 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDYqMi4ND2BWE6ELFWo3Hb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough explaining why we have to charge so often and time to start talking about what we can do to make battery life better.</p><p>Number one on the list is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-apps">apps you have installed</a>. Most every app you have will randomly start up to do something once in a while even if you're not using it. Some apps run constantly. This eats away at your battery; sometimes just a little bit and other times a lot more. If you don't use an app, uninstall it. It will always be there if you decide to use it again.</p><p>Number two is the display. Mind the brightness setting so that it's bright enough to see without being some sort of beacon. Having it too bright does nothing except eat your battery. You can also shut off the always-on display and make sure the screen time-out setting isn't too long.</p><p>Next is your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-watch-face-wear-os">watch face</a>. You can avoid displays with a seconds indicator or a lot of complications you don't use to get a real boost to your battery life. One with a black background will also save battery. The less your watch face has to refresh itself, the longer your battery will last.</p>
<p>There are some more drastic things you can do, too. These make your watch a bit less smart but they can have a significant effect on how long your battery lasts so you might want to use them from time to time.</p><p>Shut off the features you don't absolutely need. I'm talking about things like GPS or vibration or even Wi-Fi and you'll see a real gain in battery life. Bedtime mode also saves battery at the expense of using some features.</p><p>Use power saving mode or "watch only" mode in a pinch to stretch things out to the maximum.</p><p>These things can come in handy if you're out later than usual or doing something like camping where charging is pretty inconvenient.</p>
<hr>
<p>We're probably never going to be satisfied with the battery life on our watch. It does get better every year but we end up doing more and cancel it out.</p><p>These tips will help a little but the best advice is to carry a spare charger and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">battery pack</a> if you have to have your watch doing its thing and won't be home to charge it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Mishaal Rahman has shared some interesting details about developments coming to Android's popular Quick Share feature.</li><li>Recent code from the app has indicated the possibility of the feature coming to iOS and macOS.</li><li>Rahman notes that the code findings have surfaced as part of a bug fix.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Quick Share is a widely popular tool for Android devices, Chromebooks, and Windows devices. While the latter received the functionality fairly recently, Mishaal Rahman says it might expand to Apple devices, too.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/quick-share-for-ios-macos-rumor-3496057/">Android Authority</a>, Rahman has shared his latest findings, revealing the possibility of Google bringing its popular file-sharing tool to devices running on Apple devices.</p><p>For starters, Rahman explains that Quick Share is built on the search giant's popular Nearby Share API, the source code of which is generally available on GitHub under the Nearby repository.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZpP5rkrR9rSC9cLxsEmKM5" name="Quick-share-tablet.jpg" alt="Quick share tile on a tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpP5rkrR9rSC9cLxsEmKM5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is believed that the repository is constantly updated to introduce backend features and occasionally fix bugs, which is usually done by engineers at Google. One such case has hinted at a bug fix involving iOS and macOS devices. The engineer rolled out the fix, and according to their comments, the bug fix apparently "benefits Quick Share on iOS and macOS," notes Rahman.</p><p>Although Google has yet to launch its file-sharing client on the said devices, the engineer's comment raises speculation about the possibility of Quick Share debuting on iOS and macOS handsets and computers. Rahman indicates that it could be the groundwork for bringing the feature soon or a random bug fix.</p><p>A launch on Apple devices wouldn't be as surprising as it sounds, and should only make shifting things between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and Apple devices much more effortless, given the lack of AirDrop support on Android.</p>
<p>Quick Share has become a significant tool for file sharing between Android phones and across platforms. Google previously had a Nearby Share client for Android handsets, while Samsung Galaxy phones had Quick Shareâ€”an in-house developed by the Korean tech giant that used to work effectively only between Galaxy handsets.</p><p>However, as part of the collaboration, Samsung and Google chose to merge their efforts into one service, and thus, Quick Share has become the default sharing tool between devices.</p><p>On the contrary, Apple has AirDrop to share files across its devices. It will be interesting to see Android phones and Apple devices unite with the launch of the anticipated Quick Share, as it would become a more ubiquitous method for sharing files, just like how these devices now share the USB-C standard. That said, it's unclear, if Quick Share were to launch on Apple devices, how it would be implemented, and if iPhone/Mac owners would actually bother using it.</p>

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor inside is faster than anything else you'll find at this price, and OnePlus's famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc">ultra-fast charging tech</a> means you'll never have battery anxiety again.</p><p>Seriously, 20 minutes on the <em>included </em>charger and you're good to go for an entire day. It's game-changing in the best of ways, and it'll make you completely forget about worrying about battery life ever again.</p>

<p>Aside from amazing processing power and battery life, the OnePlus 12R features one of the most eye-friendly OLED screens on the market. Forget Apple, Google, or Samsung, OnePlus has gone out of its way to ensure that the OnePlus 12R won't give you headaches or eye aches with its fantastic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-dc-dimming-on-the-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-12r">anti-flicker technology</a>.</p><p>For folks like me who are particularly sensitive to the harsh dimming methods often employed in LED technology, this phone has been a life saver.</p><p>Beyond that, OnePlus's Oxygen OS software is filled to the brim with features and a UI you're going to love. You'll get all the same features as the more expensive OnePlus 12, plus great software support for the next four years including three major Android updates.</p><p>In fact, the Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-releases-android-15-based-oxygenos-15-heres-when-your-phone-will-get-the-update">Oxygen OS 15</a> open beta was just released for the OnePlus 12 and 12R, making them the first Android phones in the U.S. to receive Android 15 immediately after Google Pixel phones.</p><p>Wondering about the rest of the phone? Don't worry, because OnePlus' build quality and haptics are among the best in the industry. This one sports an IP64 water and dust resistance rating, so it's good to go for sandy beaches and rainy days; just don't submerge it in the water for a long time.</p><p>Plus, the camera is surprisingly capable given the price, going toe-to-toe with the more expensive OnePlus 12 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-vs-oneplus-12-camera-review">in my camera tests</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor might have revived the idea of a cheaper Galaxy Z Flip after Samsung previously refuted it.</p><p>The rumor was posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.naver.com/yeux1122/223642347771">Naver</a> (Korean) by Lanzuk, who states Samsung could be developing a "Galaxy Z Flip FE" for 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/04/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fold-7-rumor-2025/">9to5Google</a>). This device seems to be an addition to what we expect next year: the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Although, early on, it's unclear how/when the Korean OEM will launch the (supposed) cheaper clamshell.</p><p>Lanzuk claims a "schedule has not yet set" and that a "simultaneous release is likely." The post adds that this is "more or less confirmed" for 2025.</p><p>The publication spotted another tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1852170047743234210">Jukanlosreve</a> on X, who posted similar rumors last Thursday (Oct 31). Moreover, the tipsters on Naver and X suggest that the Galaxy Z Fold series is in for an "addition." The idea of another Fold in 2025 resurged recently as rumors spotted a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2025-dual-fold-codename-leak">Q7M</a>" device codename. However, those rumors diverged from marking it as a "cheaper" device and suggested it could be Samsung's dual-folding concept.</p><p>Elsewhere, rumors highlight the "Galaxy S25 Slim," which appeared again in a Korean report concerning stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-slim-galaxy-s25-might-be-samsungs-answer-to-apples-rumored-thin-iphone-17">competition with Apple</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip is its cheapest foldable, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-make-galaxy-z-flip-fe">in the wake of the Razr 2023</a>, it was evident that the Korean OEM needed to do more affordability-wise. It's worth noting that the cheaper 2023 Razr is a few hundred bucks less than the Galaxy Z Flip. What's more, Samsung has an odd topsy-turvey relationship with the idea of a "cheaper" or "more affordable" foldable.</p><p>The company stated it "would not release a Galaxy Z Flip under $500" in 2024 as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-denies-midrange-foldable-rumors">it refuted claims</a> about such a model. Interestingly, the idea wasn't thrown out the window as a spokesperson said, "there's nothing decided on the matter" of a Galaxy Z Flip FE.</p><p>Curiously, Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-s25-teases-cheaper-foldable-xr-device-2025">Q3 2024 earnings report</a> suggests it's warming up to a cheaper foldable in the future. The company reportedly views its foldable devices as a "growth vector for innovation." As such, the company stated during the call that it is "considering ways to lower entry barriers so that more customers can actually experience foldable products."</p><p>Of course, this came a week after Samsung stated it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-says-it-has-no-plans-to-make-a-cheaper-foldable-but-why">has no plans</a> to launch a cheaper Galaxy Z Fold. With so much uncertainty about Samsung's foldables, it's best to take things cautiously.</p>

While the focus is clearly on the OnePlus 13, I like looking ahead to what&apos;s coming in 2025 with the OnePlus 14.</p><p>Phone launch cycles take anywhere from 12 to 15 months, so OnePlus is hard at work on the OnePlus 14, even if we won&apos;t get to know any details about the device for a while. Key details are selected months in advance â€” like whether to go with Qualcomm or MediaTek and choosing camera modules â€” and we should be able to know more in this area soon enough considering the amount of interest in OnePlus leaks.</p><p>That said, I&apos;m sharing what I think is likely to be unchanged with the OnePlus 14, and where we might get decent upgrades.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4QEnsjhSowEc2TZM3xYjhY" name="oneplus-13-official" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QEnsjhSowEc2TZM3xYjhY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus has always used Qualcomm hardware in its high-end devices, and that is unlikely to change with the OnePlus 14. While OPPO switched to MediaTek with the Find X8 and X8 Pro, these devices won&apos;t release in North America, and with OnePlus maintaining a decent foothold in the region, I doubt the manufacturer would choose anything other than Qualcomm.</p><p>OnePlus worked closely with BOE to tailor the AMOLED panels on its latest devices, and that partnership is likely to continue as well. The OnePlus 13 used the same panel as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a>, and it is likely that the OnePlus 14 will pick up some upgrades.</p><p>Most manufacturers are switching to silicon-carbon batteries in 2025, and the OnePlus 13 is no different, with the device picking up a huge 6000mAh unit. While the increased density makes it a no-brainer to use within a device, you no longer get dual battery cells, and that affects charging. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>, the OnePlus 13 goes up to 100W, but it will take longer to charge the battery, and I don&apos;t see any changes in this regard with the OnePlus 14.</p>

<p>While I don&apos;t have any details of the design of the OnePlus 14, I&apos;m not a huge fan of what OnePlus did with the OnePlus 13, with the device switching to flatter sides. OnePlus phones always maintained a similar design aesthetic with smooth curves, but like most other devices available today, the OnePlus 13 has a bulkier look that doesn&apos;t look as elegant.</p><p>The OnePlus 14 should pick up camera upgrades as well; the OnePlus 13 uses the same 50MP main camera as last year, and it is likely the OnePlus 14 will get a higher-resolution sensor. I&apos;d like to see the 1-inch sensor that&apos;s used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> make its way to OnePlus devices, and we may see just that in 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kersukxmGC4L8iY6McykXa" name="oxygenos-15-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kersukxmGC4L8iY6McykXa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus tends to unveil its latest flagship in China in Q4 2024, and launch the device globally â€” usually at an event in India â€” in the following quarter. The OnePlus 13 is sticking to the same timeline, and if that&apos;s any indication, the OnePlus 14 should be announced in October or November 2025, with an eventual global launch in early 2026.</p><p>With the OnePlus 13 getting a noticeable price hike, it is possible the OnePlus 14 slots in at the same amount. Then again, with the device at least a year away, there&apos;s no way to predict its pricing â€” these things are decided just a month before release. As always, I&apos;ll update this post once we get tangible details of the OnePlus 14.</p>

What I like about its products is that they come with an LCD panel that showcases real-time stats, whether that&apos;s charging info, USB or HDMI connection details, or transfer status when moving data.</p><p>Dockcase&apos;s latest product is the Smart MagSafe M.2 SSD Enclosure; as the name suggests, it is an SSD enclosure that relies on MagSafe to securely attach to the back of your device. It is currently being <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dockcaseexplorerepro/dockcase-smart-magsafe-m2-nvme-ssd-enclosure">crowdsourced on Kickstarter for $49</a>, and will debut for $79 as soon as it hits retail availability. That&apos;s the 15W model, and there&apos;s a 100W edition that you can get for $69, which will cost $99 at retail.</p>

<p>The MagSafe SSD is made out of an aluminum chassis, and it isn&apos;t too heavy at 53g. It has built-in passive cooling that does a good job ensuring the SSD that&apos;s slotted within doesn&apos;t overheat, and in my testing, thermals weren&apos;t an issue.</p>

<p>The best part is that it has magnets at the back that allow you to attach the SSD to the back of your phone. Technically, this is designed to be used with MagSafe products, and I had no issues connecting it to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. But with Android phones also picking up the ability to use MagSafe accessories via cases, that&apos;s the route I took.</p>

Dockcase provided a 128GB M.2 drive with the enclosure to test, but the device can slot in any M.2 2230 or even M.2 2242 SSDs up to 2TB in size.</p>

<p>With the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds using the M.2 2230 standard, there are plenty of great SSD options available, and I recommend Corsair&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-CORE-Mini-NVMe/dp/B0CKXXY791">MP600 Core Mini</a>. Using the MagSafe SSD enclosure with my Pixel 9 Pro XL was straightforward; the external drive showed up as soon as it was connected, and I was able to easily transfer data out of my phone.</p>
<p>The built-in panel comes in handy in this regard, and the ability to see real-time transfers on an external SSD is just cool. The enclosure attached securely to the back of the Thinborne case, and there wasn&apos;t an instance where I was worried about it dislodging.</p>

<p>You get two USB-C ports on the device â€” one is to connect to host devices, and the other is used for passthrough charging. The model I tested came with 100W USB PD charging and was able to deliver 90W via passthrough mode, so you can plug in a charger to the power port on the MagSafe SSD enclosure and have the other USB-C port deliver up to 90W of power to connected devices while transferring data.</p>

<p>The USB-C port uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard, and has a bandwidth of 10Gbps, which is more than adequate for phones and devices like the Steam Deck. Having an SSD attach to the back of the phone instead of dangling around is highly convenient, and where Dockcase shines is the versatility â€” you can use any M.2 2230 or 2242 SSD with the enclosure.</p>
<p>I used a few MagSafe-based SSDs, and Dockcase&apos;s product clearly has a lot going for it.

<p>I'm not comfortable reviewing my Garmin Fenix 8 yet. It's Garmin's most densely packed watch yet, with enough features that it'll take me a couple more weeks to give them justice. But after years testing $400-ish Garmin watches and waiting years for my first Fenix, the Fenix 8 hasn't fully lived up to my sky-high expectations.</p><p>I received and unboxed my Garmin Fenix 8 later than most, still getting my bearings while Fenix 8 owners noticed it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/385888/cold-water-crash">crashing in cold water</a> or showing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/382071/nap-glance-showing-hundreds-of-thousands-of-hours-of-naps">thousand-hour naps</a> (or naps when they weren't napping). Annoyed Garmin forum users spotted a bevy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/382626/fenix-8-list-of-software-issues">other software issues</a>, some niche but others widespread.</p>

<p>By October, the Fenix 8 had received some useful patches, but I still encountered problems like input lag when navigating the main UI. When I tried to end a two-mile walk activity, the watch froze on the "Saving" screen for hours and refused to factory reset until I plugged it into my computer. Then, the battery drained at an insane rate (about 85% in under two days) until I charged and restarted it.</p><p>Things have calmed down for me since then, both for battery life and general navigation. But it still seems evident that Garmin must have been on a time crunch to release the Fenix 8 on schedule â€” possibly shareholder-related considerations â€” given the number of Fenix 8 glitches that went unresolved until after launch. And that's not a great look when you're charging more money than any other fitness watch brand <em>and</em> much more than the Fenix 7 series (which started at $799).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NbSHsnAzJWRHg2hNnZfHMQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-track-run-new-UI" alt="Starting a new track run activity on the Garmin Fenix 8.

<p>I'll point out now that I <em>like</em> the Fenix 8 thus far. For starters, the revamped UI improves on what I saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> last year, particularly seeing suggested workouts and courses directly under the activity start menu. I appreciate the AMOLED/MIP options so you can prioritize battery life or better visual quality. And despite the plastic-to-titanium swap, my 47mm unit doesn't feel overly heavy at 73g.</p><p>In terms of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3#section-garmin-fenix-8">new features</a>, the Fenix 8 added strength coaching to Garmin Coach about six months after I wrote a piece demanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">Garmin make indoor workouts better</a> with tailored suggestions. As a runner, I'm still easing into strength training, but it's already a step over what most fitness watches offer for reps and beginner guidance.</p><p>You also get a microphone and speaker connected to an offline voice assistant, which is no longer restricted to passthrough commands to your smartphone. You hold down the Start button, say a simple command like "Start a Voice Note" or "Show me the weather today," and see the relevant app or widget in a few seconds. I still recommend using watch face shortcuts to pull up relevant data since the processing is a bit slow, but it helps avoid searching through menus.</p><p>While I usually rely on AllTrails on my phone for picking hiking trails in advance, Garmin's new round-trip routes let me look for alternate side trails that'll take the same amount of time but let me check out new scenery, and it's a nice change of pace!</p><p>Plus, you get the same revamped health sensor suite as the Venu 3, similar dive features to the Descent MK3 with leak-proof hardware, dual-band GPS accuracy to match the best Forerunner watches, and a built-in flashlight that's quite similar to the one I tested in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>. Its 17-day battery life isn't much higher than other Garmin watches, but its 35-hour multi-band tracking is excellent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KfzQt4nrHePNEf59bYqpKQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-track-summary-flashlight" alt="A track run summary on the Garmin Fenix 8, with the built-in LED flashlight on and visible and the intensity menu shown on the side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfzQt4nrHePNEf59bYqpKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, these are welcome additions! Garmin threw everything it had into one titanium package, so you can go from hiking to running to diving to skiing to golfing and have pretty much everything you need.</p><p>But I bring up past Garmin watches because many of these old features feel virtually identical to the cheaper watches. For example, the Fenix 8 LED is nice for emergencies but not especially bright, burns through your whole battery in a few hours, and makes you hold your wrist at an unnatural angle to illuminate what's in front of you â€” just like the Instinct 2X Solar flashlight.</p><p>The Fenix's new mic and speaker enable impromptu calls without grabbing your phone, but just like the Venu 3 and Venu 2 Plus, you'll sound quiet on the other end, and you may need to hold the speaker close to your ear if you're anywhere loud.</p>

<p>I'm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">not a big fan of MIP displays</a>, so I'm fully on board with the AMOLED switch. That said, it has the same size and PPI as the Venu 3 or Forerunner 965 displays, and I <em>think</em> the brightness and refresh rate are identical, too. In particular, I dislike the little delay you see when scrolling through widgets with the touchscreen.</p><p>In terms of accuracy, the Fenix 8 GPS has been predictably hyper-accurate thus far, but that also applies across the board down to the $350 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> with dual-band tracking. And while its heart rate tracking did excellently against my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS optical armband</a> in <em>most</em> cases, matching its average and keeping up with quick HR changes, it has the same <strong>infuriating</strong> issue as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>: When I start a hard track run without ramping up, it'll spend the first lap failing to register my faster heart rate by about 20â€“30 bpm, forcing me to pause and give the Fenix 8 time to find the correct data and skewing my aerobic/ anaerobic load totals.</p>

<p>I suspect many well-off Fenix 8 buyers choose the flagship version as a combination status symbol and catch-all fitness tool. They like its titanium style and that it <em>can</em> handle every sport under the sun, even if they only go diving or skiing once a year during vacations and mostly run, bike, or hike with it. Better to have and not need than need and not have, right?</p><p>In my case, the Fenix 8 may end up being my favorite Garmin watch because it collects the best bits from the Forerunner, Venu, and Instinct lineups. But is that enough to say the Fenix 8 is "worth the price," as a lot of current Fenix 8 reviews say?</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 isn't a cheap watch, but it's ultimately up to you to determine whether it's worth the high price tag.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When journalists and tech YouTubers say a device is so good that they'd spend $1,000+ on it, they probably mean it. But they <em>didn't</em>; they got it for free. We generally try not to let that impact our recommendations, and there's no pressure to justify or nitpick an expensive purchase like regular consumers feel. But it's still hard to say if something is "too expensive" when your budget isn't affected.</p><p>When I reviewed expensive smartwatches like the $650 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or $800 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, I had to carefully judge their true value when you can spend half as much on their siblings and get most of the same features (like the Fenix 8). They're great watches but too expensive for many people, and the Fenix 8 deserves that scrutiny, too.</p><p>One point in Apple and Samsung's favor was that their flagship watches were technically "standalone" thanks to built-in LTE support. Since Garmin hasn't offered LTE outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Bounce LTE</a> for kids, your Fenix 8 still has your short-lived smartphone as a pain point for staying in touch on long excursions.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my case, the Fenix 8 is <em>very</em> nice to have, especially the new navigation features. But I don't "need" it, and if I were shopping for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watch</a> for my needs, it'd be hard to justify spending that extra $500 for streamlined software, voice commands, and dynamic routing when the $600 Forerunner 965 has most of the same essentials.</p><p>I've hyped up the Fenix in my head for a while, and an $1,100 price tag implies a certain level of greatness. But the familiar tech, buggy launch, and lack of emergency cellular combined with that price are enough to offset slightly just how fantastic a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> this is.</p>
