<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy Wearable app lists upcoming products such as the Galaxy Buds 3/ 3 Pro, Galaxy Watch 7, and Galaxy Ring.</li><li>The interesting thing to look forward to is the new Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro's stem design.</li><li>The leak hints that we might finally see the Galaxy Ring in action after its debut at MWC early this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Recent new evidence indicated that Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy foldable launch is heading for an early July release this year. Several other Galaxy products are in the pipeline and are expected to launch alongside the foldable. Interestingly, most of them are now listed on Samsung&apos;s wearable app before launch.</p><p>Samsung has a Galaxy Wearable app showing all its compatible devices for Galaxy phones. An X user, Rydah, shared a leaked screenshot (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-buds-3-leak-3451132/">Android Authority</a>) of the app that shows all the latest and upcoming Galaxy devices.¬†</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung leaking their own products is priceless. Here's the Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro üëãüèΩ pic.twitter.com/2mJP3ZFOa9<a href="https://twitter.com/RydahDoesTech/status/1800926508149813306">June 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The list comprises the recently released first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">budget smartwatch</a> from Samsung, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">Galaxy Watch FE</a>. It is accompanied by the soon-to-be-launched Galaxy Buds 3 and the Buds 3 Pro. Next to them is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>; interestingly, there is no rumored Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra model. The most awaited fitness tracker, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, is also present on the list.</p><p>The other devices in the list include the currently available ones like Galaxy Fit 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Galaxy Buds 2</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a>, amongst others.¬†</p><p>The interesting thing about the list isn&apos;t the device models but rather the iconography accompanying them. They reveal the device&apos;s design, and the exciting new change appears to be that of the Galaxy Buds 3 and the Buds 3 Pro; unlike the predecessors, which feature a rounded earbud design, the Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro come with a new stem design similar to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/airpods-pro-review">Apple AirPods Pro</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nooooo!!

<p>This new design has also been witnessed in a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-apple-like-redesign-leak">marketing image leak</a> of the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro, which showcased the new stem; however, the image was pixelated. Samsung&apos;s choice of the new design aesthetic for these buds still needs to be determined. However, the change in design implies a better fit of the earbuds for users, better microphone quality with the stem design, ease of removal and placement in the charging case, and handier touch controls.</p><p>Nevertheless, these capabilities are still purely theoretical at this moment; more details are likely to be shared by Samsung at the Unpacked event, which is now tipped to be held on July 10, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-gets-launch-date">latest leak</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>It‚Äôs been six months since the Galaxy S24 series took off, and another set of Galaxy foldables is on for July. However, another popular handset from Samsung is still in the pipeline ‚Äî the affordable Galaxy S24 FE, which is now shown in leaked renders.</p><p>Samsung traditionally launches a toned-down version of its flagship series every year. This year‚Äôs Galaxy S24 FE is no different, according to the leaked renders from tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks), who shared them via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-first-look-revealed-via-5k-renders-360-video/">Giznext</a>. At first glance, it looks similar to what we saw on the duo of Galaxy S24 models early this year.¬†</p>

<p>On the front, the device equips an Infinity-O display with minimal bezels and a slightly noticeable chin at the bottom. The renders showcase a triple camera setup stacked vertically on the back. The Galaxy S24 FE carries the volume rockers and the power button on the right pane of the device.</p><p>Hemmerstoffer further reveals the expected specifications of the Galaxy S24 FE, including a 6.65-inch AMOLED display and the device approximately measuring 162mm x 77.3mm x 8mm. Underneath, the upcoming Fan Edition will likely feature the Exynos 2400 SoC, also seen in Galaxy S24 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> models in regions except the U.S. The device with the same chipset has recently hit the benchmark test (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-fe-spotted-geekbench/">SamMobile</a>), scoring 2047 single points and 6289 multi-core points.</p>

<p>The benchmark test further confirmed the device features 8GB of RAM and runs Android 14, presumably with One UI 6.1 on top of it. OnLeaks, however, indicated that the device would go with up to 12GB of RAM aided by 256GB of onboard storage, and for the U.S., Galaxy S24 FE might still equip the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chipset. As for optics, the device will likely host a 50MP primary camera from the Galaxy S24 series aided by telephoto and ultra-wide angle lens.</p><p>Going by its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 FE will likely hit the market sometime in the fall of this year. However, Samsung needs to rework the pricing for the upcoming Fan Edition, as the previous model received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s23-fe-launches-in-india-but-you-shouldnt-buy-it-heres-what-to-get-instead">some flack</a> for the value it was offering despite being a toned-down version of the flagship.</p>

Now it&apos;s releasing its first-ever bike computer, the COROS DURA, with a very similar approach: high-end specs, budget price.</p><p>Like the popular Garmin Edge bike computers, the COROS DURA is a water-resistant, backlit LCD device mounted to your bike handlebar that can display offline GPX maps, turn-by-turn navigation, upcoming climbs, and checkpoints for mid-route guidance.</p><p>Its 2.7-inch, 480x240 MIP display can last an epic 70‚Äì120 hours depending on whether you use GPS only or multi-band GPS, and that&apos;s before the solar recharge. For comparison, the high-end Garmin Edge 1040 Solar only lasts 50 hours in dual-band mode with solar.</p><p>Meanwhile, bike computers closer to the DURA in price ‚Äî like the Wahoo Bolt or Garmin Edge 530 ‚Äî¬†typically only last about 20 hours per charge.</p>

<p>Aside from GPS, the COROS DURA has an altimeter, compass, temp sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscope, and it connects via Bluetooth or ANT+; the latter helps it sync with e-bikes and smart trainers.</p><p>The COROS DURA tracks your training load and fitness level, though you&apos;ll want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a> or watch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">PACE 3</a> to sync heart rate data. It also displays your workouts or training plans and has an FTP Test.</p>

<p>The COROS DURA uses a standard quarter-turn mount that comes in the box. It works in conditions between -20¬∫C/ -4¬∫F and 60¬∫C/ 140¬∫F. It comes with six main activity modes: road, indoor, gravel, MTB, E-bike, and E-MTB.</p><p>As the COROS DURA is its first bike computer, plenty of common features and integrations remain works in progress. COROS says it plans to add Strava Live Segments, "Ride with GPS" app compatibility, music playback controls, Zwift integration, and other software updates down the line.¬†</p><p>COROS says it designed the DURA with input from "some of the world&apos;s best off-road endurance cyclists" and that it&apos;s been tested in real-life endurance races like the Unbound 200. The name Dura means "a hard thing" in Spanish, which COROS says is meant to represent the bike computer supporting you during hard rides.¬†</p><p>Android Central has a DURA review unit and intends to test out its reliability over the coming months. So far, we&apos;re simply excited by its affordability and longevity. Its price is well below the cheapest Garmin Edge and closely matches the Wahoo ELEMNT Bolt v2, while its solar-powered battery life is well above the competition. Time will tell if serious cyclists will gravitate towards it, but it certainly has the essentials for anyone considering buying a bike computer for the first time.¬†</p><p>You can pre-order the COROS DURA now before its July 1 ship date at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.coros.com/dura">COROS&apos; site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, up from the Z Flip 5's 3,700mAh.</li><li>The main camera will apparently a big boost to 50MP, while the secondary camera stays at 12MP and the front camera at 10MP.</li><li>Samsung's next clamshell foldable model will presumably be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, though RAM details are not yet disclosed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve heard unofficial details about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Z Fold 6</a>, with Samsung expected to reveal them next month. But ahead of the possible July 10 event, a leaked spec sheet for the Z Flip 6 gives us a comprehensive look at Samsung&apos;s next clamshell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-just-got-spoiled-hard-in-this-massive-leak">revealing the full specs for the Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> a few days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-specs-revealed-ahead-of-unveiling-at-paris-unpacked/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a> has dropped what might be a roadmap for the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If this leak is legit, it looks like Samsung is aiming to make big improvements in several important areas for the new foldable.</p><p>The leaked specs show a big upgrade in battery life for the Z Flip 6, addressing a common complaint from consumers. It&apos;s rumored to pack a 4,000mAh battery, a nice jump from the 3,700mAh one in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Besides the battery, the leaked information hints at a major boost in camera quality. The Z Flip 6 is rumored to have a 50MP main sensor, a big step up from the last model.</p><p>Even though the main sensor seems to be getting a big upgrade, the rest of the camera setup appears to stick with the Z Flip 5&apos;s configuration.</p><p>Driving the Z Flip 6‚Äôs performance inside is likely to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor. The leak doesn&apos;t mention the RAM size, but it&apos;s safe to assume Samsung will pair this powerful processor with enough RAM to ensure smooth performance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the leaked specs show that many features are similar to those of the Z Flip 5. This means the next-generation model may sport a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED main display with a 2640 x 1080 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The cover display also apparently stays the same at 3.4 inches with Super AMOLED tech and a 720 x 748 resolution. Although there&apos;s no confirmation of a resolution upgrade, we might see better peak brightness for the cover display.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting parts of the leak is that the Z Flip 6 might keep the same dimensions and weight as the Z Flip 5. If true, this would be an impressive engineering achievement, especially with the bigger battery.</p><p>The leaked specs highlight impressive upgrades in battery life, camera quality, processing power, and AI integration for the Z Flip 6. However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-flip-6-leak-reveals-some-disappointing-news-about-their-us-pricing">potential price increase adds some complexity</a>. It‚Äôs still unclear if these enhancements will win over consumers and justify the higher cost Samsung might be planning.</p>

<ul><li>The Logitech MX Ink is a 6DoF mixed-reality stylus for $129 shipping at Meta Connect 2024.</li><li>The stylus works for both 2D drawing on an "MX Mat" or 3D roomscale design.</li><li>It comes with the Mat, an "Inkwell" for charging, and a replacement nib.</li></ul>
<p>3D design is a popular use case for virtual or mixed reality, but you usually have to use a bulky controller or your hands to design in XR. The Logitech MX Ink stylus for the Meta Quest 3 and 2 will change that, giving you a more reliable controller for the most popular VR art apps.</p><p>Announced on Monday, the Logitech MX Ink is described as having a "familiar pen-like feel, pressure-sensitive tip, and main button" that "let you sketch, grab, and manipulate in MR."</p><p>The MX Ink "seamlessly transitions from 2D to 3D spaces," says Logitech Head of AR/VR Vadim Kogan, with "the tracking accuracy expected by Meta Quest users in MR." Logitech and Meta collaborated on the stylus&apos; development to ensure it worked with both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> ‚Äî though not the productivity-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Quest Pro</a>, surprisingly.¬†</p><p>Logitech says it&apos;s "the first time Meta Quest headsets support more than two paired controllers at once." Once you pair the pen, you&apos;ll be able to drop your Touch controllers to sketch and take notes without having to switch inputs.</p>

<p>Starting at $129, the Logitech MX Ink will have two optional accessories. The MX Mat is a "friction-free drawing environment" that you can essentially use as a real-world canvas while painting in VR. And the MX Inkwell is a charging base for storing and topping off your stylus, though you can always use a simple USB-C cable.</p><p>Logitech says the Logitech MX Ink will ship around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected">Meta Connect 2024</a> on September 25. Meta is expected to announce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Quest 3S</a> at the event, and Logitech says the MX Ink will work with "future headsets."</p><p>Once it launches, the MX Ink will work with most popular XR art apps on Quest:</p>
<ul><li>Adobe Substance Modeler</li><li>Gravity Sketch</li><li>PaintingVR</li><li>Arkio</li><li>Engage</li><li>OpenBrush</li><li>GestureVR</li><li>ShapesXR</li><li>Elucis by RealizeMedical</li></ul>
<p>Logitech&apos;s announcement encourages "developers interested in integrating MX Ink with their applications" to use their GitHub page or apply for a dev kit, so I&apos;d assume this list will grow before September arrives.</p>

<p>Before this announcement, we wouldn&apos;t have guessed that the Meta Quest would be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headset</a> with stylus controller support. Despite Apple having its Pencil (2nd Gen) and Pencil Pro available for iPads, it has yet to bring stylus support to the Apple Vision Pro. That dev-focused headset would certainly benefit from more fine control options.¬†</p><p>Compared to an Apple Pencil, the Logitech MX Ink has similar perks like haptic feedback and a double-tap function, but it weighs about 8g more and is significantly thicker. We assume this can be attributed to the 6DoF tracking sensors.</p>

<p>Athletes typically choose a heart rate chest strap, armband, or fitness watch to judge health and effort. However, a relatively niche (and strange) option is wearing wireless earbuds with heart rate monitoring. I only recently heard of this tech and immediately decided to test whether earbud heart rate accuracy is good enough for serious athletes.</p><p>When I read about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-momentum-sport-review">Sennheiser Momentum Sport</a>, which sends HR data to the Polar Flow app, I wondered whether Polar H10 users would want or trust an earbud solution or if this targets more casual fans.¬†</p><p>Some athletes like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-to-want-lte-smartwatch-but-not-anymore">standalone LTE smartwatches</a> to work out phone-less, but I don&apos;t know of <em>any</em> athlete who&apos;d want to go watch-less for workouts, especially since you&apos;d lose things like GPS, running form data, and a quick-glance screen. So rather than <em>replace</em> a fitness watch, perhaps these fitness earbuds could provide more accurate data.</p><p>I decided to test multiple wireless earbuds with heart rate, but the more I looked, the more I found one-off, discontinued products like Bose SoundSport Pulse and Jabra Elite Sport. It made me wonder why these brands didn&apos;t bring HR tech to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a>: consumer apathy or unreliable results?</p><p>I tested the Sennheiser Momentum Sport and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-review">Anker Soundcore Liberty 4</a> earbuds against my favorite Garmin fitness watch and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a> across multiple runs and walks, to judge whether or not I can rely on earbuds for accurate workout data.</p>
<h2 id="earbud-heart-rate-accuracy-test-2">Earbud heart rate accuracy test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="J8FrQttreYDo8Xe87PbogV" name="heart-rate-earbuds-next-to-polar-and-coros-heart-rate-straps.jpeg" alt="The Polar H10 and COROS Heart Rate Monitor sitting on a table next to two heart rate earbuds, the Sennheiser Momentum Sport and Anker Soundcore Liberty 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8FrQttreYDo8Xe87PbogV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 only makes its workouts available through the companion app&apos;s "Wellness" page. You can&apos;t export your workouts to other fitness apps like Strava or even <em>see</em> your workouts unless the earbuds are connected. The barebones workout results page shows an HR average, chart, and set HR zones that I couldn&apos;t edit.</p><p>In other words, Anker&apos;s decision to force you to use its app makes the data all but useless to athletes. Still, I&apos;d already run three miles wearing the Liberty 4, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, and COROS HRM synced to another COROS watch, so I did my best to interpret the data.¬†</p>

<p>The COROS HRM determined a 147bpm average across my three-mile run. My Garmin Forerunner 965 measured 148bpm; the chart above shows moments where it dips more slowly than the armband when my pace slows or misses small changes in heart rate. It generally matches with few errors‚Äîwhat you&apos;d expect from a reliable optical HR monitor.</p><p>As for the earbuds, Anker calculated a 149 bpm average, which doesn&apos;t sound too imprecise at first glance. But looking at the heart rate graph closely, it has me hitting 167 or 168bpm for sustained stretches during my run; neither Garmin nor COROS measured me any higher than 159bpm.¬†</p><p>There&apos;s also the simple fact that as I ran with the Soundcore app open, my heart rate seemed to fluctuate much more erratically than my watch or HR strap. It may average out to something close to the right result, but it didn&apos;t leave me feeling confident. And in the end, the right earbud ‚Äî which tracks heart rate ‚Äî burned through its battery much more quickly than the left.</p>
<p>I switched to the Sennheiser Momentum Sport since it exports to the Polar Flow app; this meant I could actually compare heart rate charts directly and better test earbud HR accuracy. To start, I did an impromptu four-mile walk with my earbuds and Garmin watch, followed by a five-mile run.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pbwetz2EmJo2ge8CAjSsrC" name="Garmin-and-Sennheiser-heart-rate-comparison-1.jpeg" alt="Heart rate graph comparing Garmin Forerunner 965 and Sennheiser Momentum Sport workout results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pbwetz2EmJo2ge8CAjSsrC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the walk, Sennheiser fell short of Garmin by 1 bpm; since Garmin often averages about 1 bpm above my arm and chest straps, that&apos;s not a bad result. I did notice a few anomalies in the graph where Sennheiser had my heart rate leaping well above my actual effort level, but generally speaking, it followed my Forerunner data pretty closely.</p><p>My run results, for comparison, were disappointing:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hZo7Gw5oUqq4xwVX25ps4C" name="Garmin-and-Sennheiser-heart-rate-comparison-2.jpeg" alt="Heart rate graph comparing Garmin Forerunner 965 and Sennheiser Momentum Sport workout results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZo7Gw5oUqq4xwVX25ps4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things started out swimmingly. Sennheiser once again had a couple of elevated blips in the early miles but settled down and tracked Garmin closely through the first 3.5 miles. Then I decided to pick up my pace, at which point the Momentum Sport couldn&apos;t keep up: they averaged about 10bpm lower, sometimes only 5bpm down but frequently up to 15bpm off.</p><p>Sennheiser finished with a 153bpm average, only two short of Garmin&apos;s estimate. That&apos;s perfectly adequate for an everyday athlete looking for data on burned calories, but it&apos;s not accurate enough to make a serious athlete happy.</p><p>I decided to do one more proper test. I used Sennheiser&apos;s fit test to confirm I had the correct ear cup size, put on my COROS strap and Garmin watch, and did one more run split into two activities: one at a slow pace, one a hard track workout.</p>

<p>Imagine my intense frustration¬†to discover that Sennheiser and Polar failed to sync properly. For both my short run and track workout, the Polar Flow app stopped receiving new information and locked my heart rate at a set point. I didn&apos;t notice because I kept my phone in my pocket during runs.¬†</p><p>You might assume that you have to keep the Polar Flow app open, but that wasn&apos;t the case with my previous tests. Plus, you can see the track workout above showing that it suddenly started receiving heart rate data near the end, with my phone still in my pocket. For that brief glimpse, it was more of the same: the Sennheiser Momentum Sport was about 10‚Äì20 bpm short of my actual heart rate.¬†</p>
<h2 id="niche-for-a-reason-2">Niche for a reason</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1307px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cthDMb4cY8giQqhYxLuJXU" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-close-up.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbud close up in ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cthDMb4cY8giQqhYxLuJXU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1307" height="735" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I began this earbud heart rate accuracy test totally optimistic about how the results would turn out. I had a vague sense that my ears would provide a dependable window to my heart, the same way you can check someone&apos;s pulse with either their wrist or neck. Instead, I came away disappointed.</p><p>I never got any results that suggested I should trust workout earbuds as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>; the wonky data reminded me more of smart rings, which are accurate in ideal conditions but can struggle with accurate workout data and higher heart rates. Plus, I missed wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open-ear earbuds</a>, which feel much safer and more comfortable during runs.</p><p>The Sennheiser Momentum Sport also tracks body temperature during workouts, but that was also a letdown.</p><p>I used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-body-temperature-sensor-thermal-load">pro-level temperature sensor</a> during a track workout in March and discovered my body reached a low-grade fever (101¬∫F / 38.3¬∫C) at max effort. Sennheiser said my body heat never rose above 97.8¬∫F. I suspect outside airflow kept my ear canals cooler than the rest of my body and that these earbuds would work better for an indoor gym workout.¬†</p><p>A weightlifter who hates wearing watches at the gym could get away with wearing heart rate earbuds instead and get decent results for a general caloric burn number. Otherwise, I just don&apos;t see the need for this technology, at least until one company can achieve more consistent data.¬†</p>

New and existing AT&T customers who activate (or keep) their line on an eligible data plan will get over $187 slashed off the Motorola phone, knocking the price down to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2024.html"><strong>just $2.99 per month</strong></a> for 36 months. That&apos;s cheaper than buying a caramel latte every month (which just so happens to be the phone&apos;s color, by the way).</p><p>All of AT&T&apos;s primary unlimited plans ‚Äî including the Unlimited Starter, Unlimited Extra, and Unlimited Premium plans ‚Äî will get you the Moto G Stylus deal, and as we mentioned above, existing subscribers are also eligible. That means that if you&apos;re <em>already</em> signed up for one of the aforementioned unlimited plans, you can get the discounted phone with no additional action required. That last detail alone makes this one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/the-best-atandt-deals-of-month-year-up-to-dollar1000-off-galaxy-s24-ultra-free-flagships-and-more">best AT&T deals</a> I&apos;ve seen in a long time.¬†</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) was released worldwide on May 30th, but you can already get the phone for only $2.99 per month for 36 months when you add or keep a qualified line on your AT&T wireless account.¬†</p>
<p>In addition to the built-in stylus, this midrange beauty features great battery life, awesome-for-the-price Snapdragon performance, and a stunning 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED display<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="31cbaf0d-1c49-4309-a65c-77ffe81ea055" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) 128GB: $294.99" data-dimension48="Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) 128GB: $294.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>As we noted in our recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) review</a>, the device is punching way above its midrange price point. Straight out of the box, you get that nice-feeling vegan leather finish that Motorola has been using so much lately, plus a gorgeous 120Hz OLED display that you&apos;d expect on a phone that costs twice as much. Things are just as impressive under the hood, with an efficient Snapdragon chipset, surprisingly good camera technology, and of course, the built-in stylus that gives the phone its name.¬†</p><p>So what&apos;s the catch? Well, the phone is only guaranteed to receive one OS update and you won&apos;t get any of those AI software features found in recent Pixel and Galaxy phones. You&apos;ll also need to pay for the sales tax on the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) upfront <em>and </em>the standard $35 activation fee before you get the big AT&T discount, which isn&apos;t uncommon for a carrier deal like this.¬†</p><p>Another interesting thing is that the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is typically being sold unlocked at $399.99 for the 256GB version, and only a few select carriers (including AT&T) are selling the 128GB phone. If you need more storage, this may not be the deal for you. But if you want a brand new midrange smartphone for the price of a cup of coffee every month, you won&apos;t find many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-best-motorola-deals-of-month-year-save-big-on-foldable-phones-flagships-and-more">Motorola deals</a> better than this.¬†</p>

The wearable is nearly identical to the Galaxy Watch 4, except that it features Sapphire Crystal Glass. It also has a BioActive Sensor to help users keep tabs on their health and fitness data.¬†</p><p>The company states the sensor will deliver "actionable" tips to stay active throughout the day. Other features include the Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification (IHRN), which notifies users of potential signs of Afib, and an option to perform a quick ECG. The Galaxy Watch FE (Bluetooth) will be available on June 24 for $199.99, and its LTE variant will be available later this year for $249.99.</p>

To start, the full specs of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> have leaked, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-specs-leak-ahead-of-paris-unpacked/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a>¬†blew off the lid with screenshots revealing that the device will keep the 6.3-inch cover display as its predecessor but in terms of the aspect ratio (22:9) and resolution (2,376 x 968) at a possible wider external screen.¬†</p><p>The device will allegedly have the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3"> Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC and retain 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The Z Fold 6‚Äôs camera system also mirrors the setup on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. The leak suggests that it will have the same triple rear camera: a 50MP main sensor (f/1.8), a 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 10MP telephoto (f/2.4) with 3x optical zoom. The front cameras also appear unchanged, with a 10MP sensor (f/2.2) on the cover display and a 4MP sensor (f/1.8) under the internal display.</p><p>That&apos;s not all. We also got a glimpse of the Unpacked event countdown. Leaker Evan Blass shared a GIF of what looks like an official Samsung countdown on his X account. It shows that the event is set for July 10 at 10 PM Korean Standard Time (KST). Since Samsung is a significant sponsor of the Olympics in Paris, the Galaxy foldables launch is tipped to happen simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Read more on the Pixel phone update </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and watch </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This week, Pixel devices were in for a whole slew of updates. Google is bringing some useful user-facing features to its Pixels, such as display port support. With a USB-C cable, Pixel users can now watch movies and shows on a larger, secondary display, much like mirroring your screen.¬†</p><p>Pixel users are now picking up "power-off Finding" through the Find My Device network that will help users locate their¬†Pixel 8¬†or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> devices, even if they&apos;re turned off, for several hours and away from the user. Up next, in the "Recents" tab in the Phone app, users can find that unknown caller, tap the number, and tap "Lookup." The search will begin from there, delivering any relevant information users need about that unknown phone number.</p><p>Some camera improvements are also coming your way as Pixel users. The company states this new feature will let Pixel owners find the "best moment from your photo in HDR Plus with just a single shutter." ¬†This is intended for users to pick the best shot.¬†</p><p>Users will also receive an update that brings more detailed summaries to the Pixel Recorder app, along with¬†the Gemini Nano AI model appearing as a developer option for the Pixel 8 and the¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>Pixel Watches weren&apos;t left behind; they received some updates as well. The popular¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel-4">car crash detection</a>¬†feature that was only on Pixel phones is now available for¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, with the latest feature drop. Pixel Watch 2 users can now dial emergency services if they get into a severe car crash. Secondly, both Pixel Watch models&apos; can link their Paypal account to the wallet app. Google is also bringing the home app to Wear OS 3 and above-powered¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>. It allows users to easily access their smart home devices faster and easier from their wrists.</p>

Google or an authorized repair partner will run a diagnostic check using your device&apos;s serial number to see if it‚Äôs eligible. Pixel 8 owners whose devices don‚Äôt qualify for the extended warranty might still be covered under Google&apos;s standard limited warranty if they have similar display issues.¬†</p>

<p>I&apos;m not saying anything Apple has to offer is good or bad, and since I don&apos;t use an iPhone, it doesn&apos;t affect me personally. Early excitement about the announcements tells me that most of us see it as a good thing, so that&apos;s a win. These companies are supposed to work hard for our money.</p><p>Likewise, leaning on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">ChatGPT</a> and, later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-could-come-to-iphones-in-the-future">other AI-focused companies like Google</a> isn&apos;t a bad thing either. I&apos;m merely surprised that it&apos;s done in a way that makes it feel like part of iOS.</p>
<p>There are a few negatives to consider. Apple has to rely on another company to meet its standards for user privacy and diligence to protect the data once it gets sent off. They threw out fancy ways of saying the company does the same things others do, knowing that journalists would quote them instead of asking questions‚Äîit&apos;s called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/efs-encrypted-file-systems/encryption-of-data-in-transit.html">encryption in transit</a>, and it is an industry standard‚Äîand that&apos;s great. It&apos;s how user data is supposed to be protected.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XN73UXy5eYxp2EbHZPiVAh" name="iphone-siri-joke.jpg" alt="iPhone Siri Joke" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XN73UXy5eYxp2EbHZPiVAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, embedding their small-scale agent on the device and then calling on third parties is not the same as doing it all in-house. Apple has to depend on others to do the right thing, and Apple never does that.</p>
<p>The companies will. When you&apos;re someone like OpenAI, you can&apos;t afford to play too loose with user data because the internet will call you on it. Using a third party over an in-house solution will be fine, and we&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">Microsoft do it</a> with no real issues. OpenAI or Google or any other AI company isn&apos;t going to do anything Apple wouldn&apos;t approve of and I&apos;m not implying it. If anything, Apple just gambled and waited too long, and this is how it has to fix it.</p><p>Apple knew it had to eventually build out user-facing AI on the iPhone. Not doing so when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">every competitor offers it</a> makes Apple look lazy, and the reality-distortion field can&apos;t work forever. What it didn&apos;t do was work on its own generative AI platform.</p>
<p>Did it need to? No, not really. Apple is a different company than Google; outsourcing is easy, cost-efficient, and works well. Ask Microsoft. Apple made the right choice and focused on tools that will mostly work, be easy to implement, and make users happy.</p><p>The next logical step would be building out a full-scale generative AI solution as a follow-up. Apple could do this; the company can easily attract the right talent to develop the next Google Gemini or ChatGPT and can afford the infrastructure to power it. People would use it, too‚Äîeven people without an iPhone. The question is, will they?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qoT6FwVh5m9jZgJbzDbEeg" name="Steve-jobs-holding-original-iPhone-at-2007-event.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs holding the original iPhone at the announcement even in 2007" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qoT6FwVh5m9jZgJbzDbEeg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: David Paul Morris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sending calls out to a third party through the operating system isn&apos;t the same as bundling in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-manage-youtube-app-android">YouTube app</a>. It leaves an impression that OpenAI is somehow more capable than Apple because Apple is willing to include ChatGPT as part of Siri. Like custom colors for icons, we would have never seen this when Steve Jobs was at the helm.</p><p>Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Neither; it&apos;s just a thing. Maybe we should get used to it, and Apple will become more like other tech companies, little-by-little. Or maybe this is an emergency solution while Apple builds the next breakthrough AI platform.</p>
<p>This has done one thing: It has made people who were not interested in Apple&apos;s previous phones curious. An iPhone seems like a great product, but it isn&apos;t for me. I don&apos;t like Apple&apos;s way of doing things. But I&apos;m interested in seeing how all the new features work. That means what Apple is doing is good for business and good for the industry as a whole.</p><p>Maybe moving on from the Steve Jobs era is an equally good thing for Apple.</p>
