<ul><li>OPPO detailed a major AI update for its ColorOS 15 (Android 15) software thanks to Google's software.</li><li>ColorOS 15 will provide Circle to Search, Gemini Live, and more of OPPO's own AI help thanks to Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash models.</li><li>OPPO is preparing to debut its Find X8 series on November 21.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OPPO is preparing to rollout some AI additions for its Android 15 software that should aid users in multiple ways.</p><p>The company detailed the upcoming AI features that leverage Google's systems in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/find-x8-series-coloros-15-google-gemini-ai/">press release</a>. OPPO's general manager, Nicole Zhang, stated a goal with its OS was to "create an easy-to-use, harmonious, powerful experience through intelligence and collaboration." With that, the Chinese OEM announced the upcoming arrival of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>The post reiterates that users can produce the feature by long-pressing the "home button or navigation bar." Users can quickly circle or highlight anything on their display to run a search through Google.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company states it's bringing in more AI features as ColorOS 15 will feature the dedicated Gemini app. OPPO mentions features like "help me write," AI planning assistance, and more. Additionally, OPPO's partnership with Google brings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a> to its "smart devices."</p><p>OPPO is working on a few AI-backed features of its own, but they will reportedly leverage Google's software. According to the post, the upcoming OS upgrade will pick up OPPO Notes, Documents, and AI Recording Summary. These features are said to leverage "Gemini models" like 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash. It's likely these models will lend a hand for other on-device AI features, too.</p><p>OPPO states its ColorOS 15 software and Google's AI assistance will debut first on the Find X8 series.</p>

<p>We're on the cusp of OPPO's next flagship series as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-answer-to-the-galaxy-s25-is-launching-globally-on-november-21">Find X8 is set to debut</a> on November 21. The company confirmed as much earlier this month, stating an event in Bali will hold all the details. Alongside its launch with ColorOS 15 (Android 15), the Find X8 series will feature the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 SoC. The devices will seemingly sport a new, flatter design and larger batteries.</p><p>Additionally, the company confirmed that the Find X8 will arrive in a few global regions like the U.K. and India.</p><p>Google first dropped Gemini Live as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">update for Pixels</a> in August. The AI lets users engage in a more "conversational" way when asking for ideas, tips, and assistance with tasks. Google states Gemini Live can understand "complex questions," meaning users won't have to break up their sentences. The feature was then rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">to all Android users</a> in October with increased language support.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Most of us are glad we have a smartphone. We enjoy the things we can do with one, depend on one for many of our day-to-day tasks, and carry one around with us all of the time. With the right phone, your life is better in a lot of ways.</p><p>Did you ever stop to think about why? Buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the right phone</a> can be hard because there are so many to choose from, but once that's done we usually just start using it without a thought about the things that make a phone useful.</p>
<p>None of those things would be possible without people developing software that gets added on top of Android. You might not know, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android is really basic</a>; it's mostly just software that can boot up a phone, support the hardware inside of it, and provide a platform for other software to run. It's that other software that you love to use or depend on every day.</p><p>That's why I think the most important updates to come out of Google are the ones for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-in-android-studio-debut">"official" developer tools</a>. Improvements to the Android Studio development environment and the other tools developers need are why you want to use your phone.</p>

<p>I'm not an app developer. I have written a handful of apps for both Android and iOS to learn how the process works, but I've never even tried to write an app you would want to use. That experience did teach me a few things, though; the tools are more important than anything else Google can do to further Android as a platform.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/11/android-emulator-stability-performance-updates.html">update to the Android emulator</a> (software that "runs" Android so apps can be tested in a live setting) is a great example. Almost every developer depends on the emulator, and there are some issues with it. It would get sluggish or lock up after a while on even the strongest computer hardware. Google decided to focus on improving it, and the most recent update is great. It's still not perfect, but Google hasn't said it is done working on it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-purple-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google hasn't always done a good job here. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app#0" target="_blank">easy to become an Android app developer,</a> and if you're familiar with any sort of software development, you could have an app ready for the Play Store in a few hours. Throw all of that out the window when you're talking about a <strong>good</strong> app, though. In the beginning, terrible developer tools meant a million terrible apps in the Play Store for every good one. People don't want to write terrible apps, and thankfully, Google realized how important it was to support anyone — including you — who wants to make the next great Android app.</p><p>Writing an application that people will want to use is hard. First, you need to come up with the right idea, work through the issues that you know will arise as you get started, find ways to make your software work with thousands of different devices, and <em>then</em> write the good code that makes an app great. Without the right tools, most of this is going to be very difficult.</p>
<p>You're probably not an app developer, and improvements to these tools and new features in Android Studio probably don't seem very exciting to you. You only need to understand that these updates are important — sometimes more important than an update you'll get on your phone.</p><p>These are the things that make your phone, and Android as a whole, better.</p>

<p>A couple of leaked dummy models of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra give us a clearer look at what the new design might bring to the table.</p><p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy S25</a> series launch gets closer, leaks are spilling everywhere. Leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jukanlosreve/status/1859187280264695898" target="_blank">Jukanlosreve</a>’s recent X post shows dummy unit images revealing some design tweaks, like rounded corners and concentric camera rings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dummy-leaks-2025-flagship-3501477/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p>

<p>We’re still waiting on official (or real-life) Galaxy S25 Ultra photos, but this new leak gives us a better glimpse so far. This comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">just a couple of months after renders dropped</a>, teasing some design changes for the phone.</p><p>Breaking away from the sharp angles of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, the S25 Ultra seems to adopt softer curves. These tweaks could make it feel better in your hand.</p><p>More to the point, these dummy units suggest that the S25 Ultra is ditching the line's old design for a flatter frame and rounder corners, making it look more like the squarer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy S24</a> base and Plus models.</p><p>Earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://online-solitaire.com/blog/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-as-aluminium-dummy-phone-2/" target="_blank">rumors</a> pegged the high-end device at 162.82 x 77.65 x 8.25mm. Taking a closer look, this new model is a bit taller, slimmer, and thinner than the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which comes in at 6.40 x 3.11 x 0.34 inches.</p><p>The leaked dummy images show the S25 Ultra in black and white. The rear camera setup is mostly the same, but now the individual cameras sport concentric rings, giving off a vibe similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new leak doesn't dive into the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s camera specs, but it gives us a clear look at the design of the rear camera module.</p><p>In the past few weeks, a wave of leaks has given us plenty of details about the Galaxy S25 Ultra. We've seen how it stacks up in performance against the iPhone 16 Pro Max and got a look at how their bezel designs compare.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra, along with the S25 and S24 Plus, is rumored to arrive in January or February, so we can probably expect more leaks and rumors to surface before the official reveal.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Drive for Desktop now supports Windows on Arm, marking a big win for the platform.</li><li>The app’s in beta, so expect a few rough spots, but if you're used to setting it up on regular Windows, it’ll be an easy switch.</li><li>Outlook Meet plugin is missing, which could be a letdown for heavy Outlook users.</li><li>To use it, you need a Windows 11 PC with an Arm processor and the WebView2 runtime.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Windows on Arm just scored another win with support from Google's Drive for Desktop app.</p><p>Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/308624582/drive-for-desktop-arm64-support?hl=en" target="_blank">announced</a> a native Drive for Desktop app built for Windows on Arm devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/this-one-google-app-is-finally-here-for-qualcomm-snapdragon-arm-based-windows-11-pcs" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>). It’s in beta right now, so expect some features to feel a bit rough around the edges.</p><p>If you’re used to setting up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a> on regular Windows PCs, switching to the Arm64 version for Arm-based systems should be a breeze. The app feels the same, with the main difference being what’s under the hood (a native Arm64 support).</p><p>The native Drive for Desktop on Arm offers solid features but skips the Outlook Meet plugin. This might be a bummer for Outlook power users who depend on it for scheduling and teamwork. There's no word yet on whether Google plans to add it in future updates.</p><p>Since the native Drive for Desktop on Arm is still in beta, Google recommends using it with non-essential data or keeping backups just in case.</p><p>Even with its limitations, the native Arm version of Drive for Desktop is a big step forward. It’s a smoother, more efficient way to access and manage your files on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">cloud storage service</a> compared to the web version.</p><p>The app is now the second Google app optimized for Windows on Arm, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-chrome-windows-arm-optimization-rollout">following Chrome</a>. While Google also says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-quick-share-upgraded-arm-windows-rollout">the Quick Share app works on Windows on Arm</a>, it’s important to note that it runs through emulation.</p><p>To use the native Drive for Desktop, you'll need a Windows 11 PC with an Arm processor and the Microsoft WebView2 runtime. The setup is straightforward—just download and install the app directly from Google.</p><p>With the launch of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform and the rise of powerful, energy-efficient laptops, app compatibility became a big issue. While most major apps have been optimized for this new architecture, Google Drive was a key holdout, leaving users to rely on emulation.</p><p>The recent beta release of the native Drive for Desktop app eases those concerns and possibly boosts the adoption of Arm64 devices.</p>

Most earbuds use regular audio drivers with a magnetic coil to generate sound, but the idea with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds-with-solid-state-audio-drivers-are-about-to-go-mainstream">silicon-based alternatives</a> is that they use a piezoelectric drive in conjunction with ultra-thin membranes to make sound, and that&apos;s just inherently cool.</p>

<p>The brand making these drivers is xMEMS, and it just rolled out its latest product: the Sycamore. While its earlier Cypress driver is used in several earbuds — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/creative-aurvana-ace-2-review">Creative Aurvana Ace 2</a> — and is designed for in-ear options, the Sycamore is aimed at the open-ear category instead, and is coming to earbuds, XR glasses, and smartwatches.</p><p>The timing of the launch is interesting, because there has been a steady increase in open-ear products, with Nothing and Bose catering to this niche. With the Sycamore, xMEMS is leveraging its “sound from ultrasound” design, and with the module coming in at just 1.13mm and weighing 150mg, it is three times thinner than a regular driver and one-seventh the size.</p><p>Ahead of the launch, I had an email interaction with Mike Housholder, VP Marketing and Business Development at xMEMS Labs, to understand how the Sycamore is different to the Cypress. Housholder noted that the new driver "represents the maturation of our ultrasonic transducer technology," and that changes to the "design and efficiency of the MEMS architecture" has allowed it to go from an in-ear design to open-air.</p>

<p>Sound quality is a key metric in micro speakers, and I was interested in learning about how something as small as the Sycamore is able to produce anywhere close to the same level of sound as a regular dynamic driver. "One of the key characteristics of our ultrasonic, modulated air pulse generation technology is that it exhibits a 1st-order low frequency degradation to provide a robust low frequency response as compared to conventional dynamic drive speakers which typically exhibit a 2nd-order (more steep) low frequency degradation," said Housholder.</p><p>As such, the brand is touting a similar mid-bass performance as regular drivers, with as much as 11dB headroom in the sub-bass extension. The driver comes with IP58 ingress protection, making it a decent choice for use in active earbuds.</p><p>Another issue that&apos;s resolved with the Sycamore is designing the shell of the earbuds. With regular audio drivers, brands focus on the design and materials of the shell, but Housholder noted that as MEMS speakers are not as prone to back volume due to the "stiff and rigid silicon diaphragm," this isn&apos;t as big a consideration. That&apos;s a big deal for an audio manufacturer, and with the driver itself not taking up anywhere as much room, it should free up additional space for a larger battery or result in buds that are smaller.</p><p>So when will we get to see products with the new driver? Housholder noted that xMEMS will showcase prototypes at CES 2025, with mass production starting in Q4 2025 and initial consumer products debuting in 2026. Considering the number of design wins the brand managed with its earlier drivers, it shouldn&apos;t have many problems with the Sycamore, particularly given that it can be used with XR glasses and smartwatches in addition to earbuds.</p>

<p>If you are hooked on content on Instagram, like its reels or interesting posts, that is because of the suggestions the social media platform provides by learning what you've liked or prefer to view the most. While there was no way to erase your recommendations before, Meta is now bringing a new button, which might likely provide a fresh start for your recommendations on Instagram.</p><p>Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/introducing-recommendations-reset-instagram">has announced</a> that Instagram is currently testing a new feature that allows users to reset recommendations, allowing them to clear the previous ones and start fresh. These recommendation-based content users generally see on Instagram's Explore, Reels, and Feed sections. Clearing them is seemingly easy with just a couple of taps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.17%;"><img id="ctJYYvoJKM9uX3Vvic8VPJ" name="instagram-reset-suggested-content" alt="Instagram Rest Suggested Content" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ctJYYvoJKM9uX3Vvic8VPJ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="523" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instagram notes in the announcement post that the emphasis of incorporating this new feature is primarily aimed at Teens. The platform wants to "give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience" so that they can find their passions and interests as they evolve. Resetting occasionally might allow the app to learn those parameters and recommend new ones as they move forward.</p><p>Once people hit the new reset recommendations button, the app will start personalizing recommendations again to showcase relevant content based on their reactions and the accounts they often interact with.</p><p>During the resetting process, consumers are also allowed to check who they are following and can unfollow them right away if they are not interested in the respective accounts they're following.</p>
<p>After hitting reset, users can go to the explore tab again and look for content. If they like any new content, they can look for a three-dot menu and hit "Interested." Similarly, if the showcased content doesn't appease them, they can hit "Not Interested."</p><p>Instagram notes both these suggestions and further helps the social media app showcase preferred content in the future. If there are too many to deal with, the new reset button certainly comes in handy.</p><p>Although Instagram indicates that the new feature is currently in the testing phase, it will eventually roll out globally, which sounds promising.</p>

OK, maybe that's harsh, but really, because there is nothing there for you, and even Google will tell you that it's going to be a mess.</p><p>Software like this is important. Some people will need to get ready in any way they can for the coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">API changes</a> and any new ones for things like user health data. Other people need to do everything they can to try and break things and then report their findings in minute detail to the Android team at Google. The rest of us should just look and not touch. You already know if you're a person who needs to install this.</p>

<p>You've heard all this before. Every time Google throws out some pre-beta test software that nobody should install, people like me will remind you that it's not worth it. Trust me, I'll have to install it eventually and wish I didn't need to. It's just one of the things I have to do to make a living because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G44xTr8D_bw">my music career</a> never took off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another way to look at it is to ask yourself why you would even want to install this. There are no new features for you to see, and even if there are, they may not work properly. Sure, you might be able to tap things a bunch of times and see a new logo, but you could also just download a screenshot and look at it on your phone for the same result. The announced features are not there, and any underpinnings in place to be ready for them only make the system unstable right now.</p>
<p>Android 16 could turn out to be the best version of Android ever. Thanks to more phones getting supported longer, you'll probably get a chance to use it, too. When it's ready and awesome you should install it the first chance you get.</p><p>Right now, though, Android 16 sucks. It's just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, with more bugs and less stability. Let Google keep it in the kitchen and work on the recipe a little longer, and you'll be happier.</p>

<hr>
<p>Android 16’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">first developer preview</a> has introduced a new feature that softens the volume of back-to-back alerts from the same app.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-notification-cooldown-3501276/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a nifty update coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>’s notifications. Called "notification cooldown," this feature cuts alert volume if an app keeps spamming you with notifications in a short time. The goal is to cut down on distractions while keeping important notifications front and center.</p><p>With notification cooldown on, your device volume will drop and alerts will be toned down for up to two minutes if an app sends a bunch of notifications in quick succession. You’ll still see them, but they’ll pop up quietly in the notification shade instead of blasting through with a loud ping.</p>

<p>You can find notification cooldown under <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>Notifications </strong>> <strong>Notification cooldown</strong>. Keep in mind, though, that this feature won’t silence high-priority alerts, calls, or alarms.</p><p>Of course, notifications are a given, but when they come in nonstop, it can be super annoying. So, this new feature should tame those pesky repeating app alerts.</p><p>Notification cooldown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-notification-cooldown">first showed up in Android 15 Developer Preview 1</a>, but Google kept it under wraps in the first public beta and didn’t bring it back for the stable release, as Rahman points out.</p><p>Early worries about the feature being scrapped were eased when it resurfaced in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2. This suggests that Google is likely setting the stage for a wider rollout across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> by Q2 2025 when stable Android 16 rolls out.</p><p>While notification cooldown is a big win for managing alerts, it doesn’t tackle persistent vibrations just yet.</p><p>Nevertheless, this feature is a great addition for Android users. By cutting down on the flood of alerts, it helps users stay focused and put important notifications front and center.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google may be eying an Android accessibility feature that aims to limit the effect of motion sickness while using a smartphone or tablet in the car. A few code snippets relating to an unannounced <strong>Motion Cues</strong> feature were discovered in an APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-services-motion-cues-apk-teardown-3500830/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. While not a lot of information about this rumored feature is available, it's likely similar to <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong>, an accessibility tool in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18</a> that adds visual signals to your phone screen.</p><p>Motion sickness is a common problem that can be made worse by using a smartphone or tablet in the car. That's because while looking at your phone screen, your mind and body aren't able to recognize and adjust changes in vehicle movement. As such, Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues add dots to your iPhone's screen that indicate which direction a car is moving. They're clear enough to give your mind an idea of how the car is moving, while being unobtrusive enough to not significantly impede phone use.</p><p>These visual cues, as demonstrated by Apple in the graphic below, are intended to limit the effects of motion sickness. Soon, they could be coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="QsLT2tNNecvp9PzoMEff9" name="Motion-Cues-iOS-18" alt="An example of Motion Cues in iOS 18." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QsLT2tNNecvp9PzoMEff9.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="864" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In <strong>version 24.46.30</strong> of the Google Play Services beta, Android Authority spotted multiple code strings related to "motion sickness." Specifically, the code references a feature that is presumably called <strong>Motion Cues</strong>. It's described as being used to "show visual cues to mitigate the motion sickness." In other words, it sounds a lot like Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues in iOS 18.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="motion_sickness_enabled_key">motion_sickness_enabled</string>
<string name="motion_sickness_settings_activity_label">Motion Cues</string>
<string name="motion_sickness_settings_page_description">Show visual cues to mitigate the motion sickness.</string></code></pre>
<p>The feature isn't active yet, and the code snippets aren't exactly clear on how Google plans to implement these motion cues in Android. However, being that the strings are appearing in the Google Play Services beta and not an Android beta, it's possible that Motion Cues could eventually rollout for multiple Android versions. There's precedent for this, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Android's latest security updates</a> recently rolled out to most devices running Android 10 or higher.</p><p>Still, being that this feature is currently in the development stage, it's impossible to know for sure when (or if) it will release publicly.</p>

<hr>
<p>To celebrate its 50th anniversary of making big, rugged watches for athletes, Casio is selling an absurd, adorable little smartwatch that fits on your finger but barely qualifies as a "smart ring" <em>or</em> a fitness device.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.casio.com/jp/watches/casio/product.CRW-001-1/">Casio CRW-001-1JR</a>, launching in December 2024 in Japan for ￥19,800 (about $128 USD), isn't like traditional smart rings since it has no health tracking functionality. Instead, the design "combines practicality and playfulness" (via Google Translate) into a 1/10-sized watch with a stainless steel frame, LCD, and three buttons (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/the-new-casio-crw-001-1jr-is-both-a-smart-ring-and-a-smartwatch">Techradar</a>).</p><p>It measures 6.2mm thick and weighs 16g, well above the usual 3mm thickness and 2–5g weight of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a>. Aside from being a conversation starter, the Casio smart ring has programmable alarms to wake you up and a stopwatch function for up to 60 minutes.</p>

<p>Aside from Casio superfans, this quirky novelty tech may not appeal to many people. But the idea of a smart ring that takes after smartwatches is a persistent one, and it's unclear how close smart rings will eventually stray into smartwatch territory with more <em>traditional</em> smarts beyond health.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-05.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most smart rings are meant to be invisible; unless you look at the companion app on your phone, you wouldn't even know if it's working. But a few rings specifically take after smartwatches — if not to the extent of the Casio smart ring.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> supports gesture control shortcuts for phone connectivity, just as smartwatches have gesture tricks like the double-tap.</p><p>The Circular Ring has a haptic motor for gently waking you up, signaling notifications or medication reminders, and guiding you during meditation. The original Pro had a button to end haptic feedback, while the newer Circular Slim has a reactive touch surface on the logo.</p><p>Early smart ring prototypes like the Smarty Ring and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motiv-ring-review">Motiv Ring</a> had outer displays or LED indicators, following in line with smartwatches at the time. Motiv, for instance, would let you twist the ring to trigger a gesture and then light up the LED if it was successful. A green light signaled a 100% charge, a blue light meant data syncing, and so on.</p>

<p>If you look into the Wild West of smart ring Indiegogo campaigns today, several of them have some kind of touch strip or multi-color LED indicator. Though there's no guarantee any of them will successfully launch, and they have other ambitious promises like blood pressure tracking, people still spend millions on these prototypes, hoping for the best.</p><p>Right now, successful and established smart rings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> have designs centered on their lightness and traditional style. Almost no one wants an LED strip or bulky design that calls attention to the ring's techy nature; they want subtlety.</p><p>But I wonder — as smart rings continue to flood the market offering the same health data — if  we'll see more phone-ring integration to make rings more of a watch replacement for people who wear basic luxury watches instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> or Apple Watches.</p><p>Basically, I'm curious if future smart rings will take the same approach as hybrid watches, with a tiny strip that looks "normal" but can occasionally light up with a tiny notification, letting you know whether or not to take your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>But until smart rings can pull that off more subtly than Casio's unintentionally hilarious design, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-key-differences">smart rings and smartwatches</a> should probably stay in their own lanes.</p>
