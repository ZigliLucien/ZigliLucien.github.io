<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How many software updates will the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold get?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Google is one of the most committed Android manufacturers when it comes to software updates and the brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is no exception with seven years of Pixel updates. Launching with Android 14, you can expect this phone to be on the latest build of Android with up-to-date security patches for years to come.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="update-parity-with-the-pixel-9-series-2">Update parity with the Pixel 9 series</h2>
<p>Google’s latest folding phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> looks a bit like a parts bin special from the spec sheet with the same Tensor G4 SoC and 16GB of RAM as the Pixel 9 Pro, but that&apos;s far from a bad thing. While the previous Pixel Fold came with the aging Tensor G2 and 12GB of RAM, this new Fold is in line with the latest Pixel 9 Pro generation and is set to receive the same number of software updates with seven years of support.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold will receive security updates as well as the latest version of Android until August of 2031. That means your phone will not only remain secure for years to come, but you’ll be able to try out the latest builds of Android so you won’t be missing out on too many features. With hardware that matches the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL in terms of power, this phone should be able to keep up with your needs for as long as, and perhaps longer than you will want to keep your Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>If you were considering the last generation Pixel Fold, keep in mind that Google has only committed to five years of updates for that device, so it will stop receiving Android updates in June 2026 and security updates in June 2028. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold">Comparing the two folding Pixel phones</a>, the newer version is the way to go. And that’s before you consider all of the other hardware improvements like better displays, a faster SoC, more RAM, and better Wi-Fi.</p><p>It&apos;s a very real possibility that your Pixel 9 Pro Fold will be damaged before it stops getting updates, so it&apos;s a good idea to protect it with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">best Pixel 9 Pro Fold cases.</a> While it&apos;s water resis</p>

<p>Google&apos;s new Pixel 9 series has arrived, and with it comes a new Pixel 9 Pro XL, the larger of the two Pro models. Technically, it&apos;s a more direct successor to the Pixel 8 Pro, which features a much larger display than the Pixel 8, but the "XL" adds a new dimension to the moniker, letting users know that they have a choice.</p><p>We&apos;ve had brief hands-on time with the Pixel 9 Pro XL and still need to spend more time with it before we have a full picture of it. So far, it looks like it could be the phone to get if you want a larger flagship, or you can potentially save some money and go for the older, extremely capable Pixel 8 Pro. Our Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro comparison should help you choose if you&apos;re having a hard time deciding.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="An Obsidian and Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After years of sticking with largely the same design for the Pixel series, Google is finally changing things up with what can only be described as an evolution of its previous Pixel design language. The iconic camera bar present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> is gone, replaced by a floating camera visor that certainly stands out among the rest of the Pixel 9 Pro XL design. This is perhaps the most obvious difference between these two phones, but it doesn&apos;t stop there.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> has adopted an iPhone-like design with a flat front and back panel and a flat frame. If it weren&apos;t for the camera visor and the lack of a Dynamic Island on the front, you could almost mistake this for an iPhone. This is contrasted by the softer, less angular design of the Pixel 8 Pro, with a matte glass back panel that curves into the slightly rounded frame. Even the display, which is flat on the 8 Pro, has the smallest curve on the bezel where it meets the frame, and the camera bar also curves up from the frame as if the two are a singular piece.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8TGbvkby2dCXjrvpZE6HAh" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-05-camera-bars.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8TGbvkby2dCXjrvpZE6HAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones look great in their own way, although it&apos;s unclear how the Pixel 9 Pro XL design will be received, especially once consumers get it in hand. Some consumers find that flat, angular phones tend to be a bit painful to hold as they dig into their fingers when held with one hand, and the curved Pixel 8 Pro is fairly comfortable to hold. There is a slight curve to the frame, so hopefully that will alleviate any concerns.</p><p>Both phones are also large, with the Pixel 9 Pro XL sporting a slightly bigger 6.8-inch display. Despite that, the phones have roughly the same height and width, although the 9 Pro XL is a bit heavier at 221g. But aside from the slight increase in size, there&apos;s not much difference between the two displays. The Pixel 9 Pro XL features the same resolution and refresh rate but kicks things up with higher peak brightness at 3,000 nits, meaning you should have no trouble viewing this display outdoors.</p>

<p>For protection, both phones feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> on the front and back and IP68 water and dust resistance. The back glass is also matte on both phones, which should provide a softer touch, although you&apos;ll find some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-pro-or-xl-should-you-buy">newer colors with the Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>Google offers Obsidian and Porcelain hues for both phones, as well as some form of green. However, instead of blue, the Pixel 9 Pro comes in a pink Rose Quarts hue, which stands out among the other options.</p>

<p>Google has upgraded the Pixel 9 Pro XL with a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">Tensor G4</a> chipset, which offers a 20% performance boost when browsing and is 17% faster when opening apps when compared to its predecessor. How this really translates in real-life use is still yet to be determined, but the focus remains clear: AI performance. Thus, Google is enabling tons of new features with the chip, which we&apos;ll discuss in the next section.</p><p>In addition to the chip boost, Google has also upped the RAM to 16, meaning the Pixel 9 Pro should be able to handle more tasks. The 12GB features on the Pixel 8 Pro is great for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, but 16GB gives the phone much more room for activities.</p>

<p>One benefit of the new chip is support for satellite connectivity, something we&apos;ve seen on the iPhone and have been waiting to see more widely available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. We could see this appear on the Pixel 8 Pro at some point, as they should also be able to support it, but the newer Exynos modem in the Pixel 9 Pro mentions satellite connectivity as a highlight feature.</p><p>You also get Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, and UWB on both devices. It&apos;s also worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro XL now uses an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which should be more accurate than its predecessor.</p><p>Interestingly, the battery inside the Pixel 9 Pro grew ever-so-slightly, up to 5060mAh from 5050mAh. However, the big change here is the charging speed, which has been increased by 7W. Google says that a 30-minute charge with its 45W charger should give you about 70% battery life, which is a <em>huge</em> jump. The Pixel 8 Pro can only reach 50% in the same amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="548bAmXmYXau2FSmft9evg" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-04-camera-bars.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/548bAmXmYXau2FSmft9evg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8 Pro offers impressive cameras, and it&apos;s hard to argue with Google&apos;s excellent computational photography. The Pixel 9 Pro XL camera setup isn&apos;t a huge upgrade from its predecessor, but there are some notable changes.</p><p>The 50MP sensor is pretty much identical, which is fine. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel 8 </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review" target="_blank">Pro&apos;s camera produces amazing photos</a> with plenty of depth and contrast while not being too over the top. It also takes fantastic low-light and nighttime images, so I expect the same from the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<p>Google outfitted the Pixel 9 Pro XL with a new 48MP ultrawide sensor, featuring a wider f/1.7 aperture, meaning it should take better low-light photos than the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s ultrawide camera. However, the tradeoff is a slightly narrower field of view at 123-degrees, compared to 125-degrees on the 9 Pro. The telephoto sensor has changed slightly but still features the same 30X Super Res Zoom.</p><p>Selfies should get a boost, with a new 42MP sensor. This will likely use pixel-binning to take 10.5MP images, the same resolution as the Pixel 8 Pro, but this could also result in sharper images and better low-light capabilities. It also has a wider field of view, which makes it better for group selfies.</p>
<p>Like the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is capable of 4K video recording but gets a literal boost thanks to Super Res Video Zoom, which appears to enhance quality when zoomed in. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a> feature also gets upgraded and upscales video to 8K resolution. It&apos;s admittedly a cool feature, and we&apos;ll have to try it out for ourselves, although it remains to be seen how useful 8K videos will be on such a small screen. However, that&apos;s not the only cool software improvement aimed at improving your camera experience...</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is likely right around the corner. Even so, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a few extra software goodies that the Pixel 8 Pro doesn&apos;t yet have or might not even get. The 8K video is one such feature, but there are a handful of cool AI-powered features that Google is touting with the 9 Pro XL. Among them is the Add Me feature, which lets you take a photo and then you can add yourself to that same image thanks to an augmented reality overlay.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> also gets some new upgrades, with new Reimagine and Auto Frame features, letting users easily alter aspects of the image to their liking or better frame a photo.</p><p>But besides camera features, Google is also adding some other helpful AI goodies, such as Gemini Live, which lets you have a more natural conversation with the assistant chatbot, and Pixel Studio, which lets you create images from text prompts. Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Weather are also new on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which bring new AI enhancements to your screenshots with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-recall-faq-everything-you-need-to-know">Recall</a>-like feature and to your weather forecasts.</p>

<p>It&apos;s quite likely many of these features will arrive on the Pixel 8 Pro, but it&apos;s clear they were built with the Tensor G4 in mind, meaning you&apos;ll get the best performance from the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which also has more RAM.</p><p>Otherwise, both phones will receive the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-8-pro-seven-android-os-updates-game-changer">7-year update promise</a>, although the Pixel 8 Pro is already a year into its software lifespan, so the Pixel 9 Pro XL may be your phone if you want that added longevity.</p>

<p>These are two top-of-the-line Pixel phones that will get you access to some of the most advanced AI features Google has to offer. The Pixel 8 Pro is one of the best there is, and it&apos;s still a fantastic choice if you&apos;re looking for a bigger phone with more cameras and more AI. Of course, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has improved on some of that with its better Tensor chipset, faster charging speeds, enhanced cameras, and new AI features.</p><p>It really comes down to design and support. The first is subjective, so it&apos;s not really cut-and-dry which phone has the better design, and it&apos;s up to your personal taste. Support on the 9 Pro XL will technically last you an additional year since it&apos;s the newer phone, but support on both still outpaces many devices on the market.</p><p>The only thing is that not all the new AI features may trickle down to the Pixel 8 Pro, and we&apos;ll have to see what makes it down the line. But if you&apos;re not too worried about that, then you really can&apos;t go wrong with either option, and the Pixel 8 Pro will at least save you a little money.</p><p>And if you want something smaller but just as powerful, you can check out our Pixel 9 Pro vs. Pixel 8 Pro comparison.</p>

<p>Heart rate monitor chest straps earn their reputation as the gold standard for workout accuracy. When it works as intended, my Polar H10 ECG delivers precise, quick-adapting results, and I&apos;ve used it for many reviews and accuracy tests against smartwatches to see how good their optical sensors are. </p><p>Despite all that, I&apos;m ready to move on from chest straps, both professionally and personally.</p><p>My thoughts on this coalesced when I performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra accuracy test</a>. Samsung promised a revamped optical sensor that would prevent light artifact issues during anaerobic workouts, so I tested the results against my COROS Heart Rate Monitor, an optical HR armband. </p><p>Someone reposted the article on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1e38o47/the_galaxy_watch_ultra_mostly_lives_up_to/?rdt=42005">r/GalaxyWatch on Reddit</a>, and the responses ranged from calling the test "kinda pointless" because I didn&apos;t use a chest strap to "Trusting Android Central to do a fitness device review?  lol." To paraphrase my childhood hero, Michael Jordan, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/2t4RVg_Yq2g">I took it personally</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-people-trust-chest-strap-heart-rates-and-don-apos-t-trust-ohrs-2">Why people trust chest strap heart rates (and don&apos;t trust OHRs)</h2>
<p>There&apos;s a widespread assumption that optical heart rate (OHR) straps can&apos;t be trusted, and journalists who use them for testing are wasting people&apos;s time. It&apos;s a reasonable belief but one that needs to be debunked. </p><p>Any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> or tracker, smart ring, or armband uses LEDs to illuminate your skin and photodiodes to catch the reflected light, visually tracking changes in your pulse. It&apos;s generally reliable but prone to errors if the PPG sensors aren&apos;t perfectly flush; arm movement introduces gaps that let in light and sweat that skew the results.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> add more LEDs and new algorithms to try and solve the light artifact issue. Samsung and Google have a bad track record at supporting external heart rate monitors, so I do at least appreciate the effort, even if early tests suggest they have more work to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DB8YUoN9BTZYv8vEMZL3XC" name="Polar-H10-heart-rate-monitor-chest-strap.jpeg" alt="The Polar H10 and its electrode-covered strap sitting on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DB8YUoN9BTZYv8vEMZL3XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A chest strap bypasses these LED issues. It uses an electrocardiograph (ECG) to read your heart muscle&apos;s electrical rhythm at its source instead of further out, where changes in blood flow might take longer to register.</p><p>Since OHRs can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9662769/">struggle with accuracy on darker skin tones</a> — some brands address this issue better than others — many athletes only trust chest straps.</p><p>That isn&apos;t to say a chest strap magically gives you perfect results every time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.polar.com/us-en/support/FAQs/Abnormal_Heart_Rate_Readings_During_Exercise">According to Polar</a>, you must moisten the Polar H10&apos;s electrodes with water, gels, or saliva (<em>ew</em>) before sweat kicks in and improves the connection. Chest hair can block the signal, as can static from a synthetic shirt or other electrical sources. And you&apos;ll need a tight enough strap to maintain the connection.</p><p>But beyond that, they&apos;re also uncomfortable! I&apos;m happy for people who&apos;ve Stockholm Syndromed themselves into getting used to chest straps&apos; fit, but the restrictive feeling keeps me out of my running "zone." I put up with it (until now) because I wanted to give readers accurate testing results.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-apos-m-using-an-ohr-arm-band-for-testing-accuracy-2">Why I&apos;m using an OHR arm band for testing accuracy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NfMqGuYQorsmSpwdMiQuGk" name="COROS-Heart-Rate-Monitor-on-arm.jpeg" alt="The COROS Heart Rate Monitor worn on the author's arm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfMqGuYQorsmSpwdMiQuGk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An OHR armband properly fitted to your biceps avoids a wrist-based sensor&apos;s issues. You have much more surface area for LEDs to read your pulse, it&apos;s more comfortable to secure tightly, and there&apos;s no bending joint to cause accidental separation during exercises like push-ups.</p><p>I received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a> for a review, and it delivered accurate results. I gifted another COROS band to my partner, who&apos;s had trouble with wrist-based OHR in the past due to skin tone, and she hasn&apos;t experienced the same issues with the arm-based strap so far.</p><p>At the time, I read the general consensus on chest straps&apos; supremacy and bought a Polar H10 to compare the two. Both gave me near-identical results, but I decided to use the H10 for my smartwatch reviews since it was supposedly better.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if my H10 is a bit defective, if I&apos;m not wetting the electrodes enough, or maybe the strap isn&apos;t perfectly fitted. But the more I use it, the more I get obvious inaccuracies during the first 10–15 minutes of a workout.</p><p>I first noticed this during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">Garmin Forerunner 165 track test</a> in March, when the H10 HR briefly dipped from 152 to 138 bpm and stayed flat while my Garmin, Coros, and Fitbit all rose to 166 bpm. But it was just one blip (I thought).</p><p>Then, during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">Coros vs. Garmin vs. Polar watch accuracy test</a>, I spotted a few moments during a normal run <em>and</em> a track workout where it spiked well above or below all three watches before auto-correcting to its usual perfection, without any adjustments on my end. It made judging the "best" watch OHR harder when my ECG control group was wonky.</p>

<p>After those Redditors decided to come for me, I performed a straightforward COROS HRM vs. Polar H10 test, pairing the COROS to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and starting a workout in the Polar Beat app simultaneously; you can see the results in the charts above (a 10K run) and below (a hard 1-mile track run).</p><p>I knew something was off during my first run, even with my phone in my pocket, because Polar Beat kept alternating audio cues for "improving fitness" and "burning fat," as if I was rapidly changing my heart rate and pace. It was simply losing and recapturing my actual heart rate signal before things settled down, and it remained perfect for 30+ minutes — without any physical adjustment on my part.</p><p>During the second test the same day, the H10 immediately claimed that I was at near-max effort before I&apos;d even hit a fast pace, then fluctuated slightly between too high and too low before nailing my heart rate a few minutes in.</p>

<p>To forestall the inevitable comments, I&apos;m not claiming all chest straps are inaccurate. I&apos;m hopeful I can figure out why my H10 has early-run issues. What&apos;s more important is each graph&apos;s second half, where you&apos;ll find Polar and COROS in near-lockstep.</p><p>They&apos;re never perfectly aligned. In the first run, whenever I increased my pace or ran up a steep hill, COROS consistently trailed by about 1 bpm before catching up and took slightly longer to register when I eased off. During the second run, Polar registers tiny 1 bpm fluctuations that COROS needs longer to catch. </p><p>But even chest strap lovers must admit that COROS&apos; optical HR graph is on point. It catches up quickly and has fewer errors than wrist-based trackers.</p><p>Personally, the accuracy gap is so minimal — and the comfort gap so wide — that I&apos;d rather wear my OHR armband; even if it&apos;s not <em>perfect</em>, it&apos;s more than good enough for Garmin or other brands to calculate my general effort and training load. And it&apos;s much easier to forget I&apos;m wearing an armband than a chest strap.</p>

<p>Yes, chest strap heart rate readings are more accurate than an arm- or wrist-based optical sensor. Fitness experts like DC Rainmaker use chest straps as review benchmarks for a reason. If you prioritize accuracy over comfort, buy a chest strap.</p><p>But here&apos;s what matters: smartwatches are <em>always</em> going to use optical readings and they&apos;re <em>never</em> going to be as good as chest straps. </p><p>Why should I exclusively use a chest strap for accuracy tests when that&apos;s a quality standard that a watch can&apos;t reasonably hit? Smartwatch HR accuracy has demonstrably improved across brands in recent years, but if chest straps are the benchmark, then every watch I review is "inaccurate" to some degree. </p><p>You shouldn&apos;t read smartwatch reviews holding them to the standard of a chest-based ECG unless you&apos;re looking for things to criticize. Instead, a more useful comparison is how its optical HR matches against a COROS HRM or Polar Verity Sense, both of which negate the usual issues with OHRs like light artifacts. Very few fitness watches come close to that standard, but a few brands are using algorithms to try and close the gap.</p><p>It&apos;s not about perfection; it&apos;s about finding watches that are <em>good enough</em> for you to compromise and leave your chest strap at home.</p>

<ul><li>The main appeal of the Wireless Power Consortium's new Qi2 charging standard is the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP).</li><li>The MPP allows Qi2-equipped devices to connect with magnetic accessories, including those that support MagSafe, such as chargers, wallets, cases, and more.</li><li>However, it has been revealed that devices do <strong>not</strong> have to support the MPP to earn Qi2 certification, creating a confusing situation. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s rare that Apple basically gift wraps a proprietary technology to give to the entire industry like the company did when it gave MagSafe to the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) for inclusion in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">the Qi2 specification</a>. I wonder what it thinks of that decision now that the WPC, Android device manufacturers, and accessory makers have seemingly botched what should&apos;ve been a monumental launch for Qi2.</p><p>We know that basically all devices that charge wirelessly use the Qi charging standard, excluding a few categories, like smartwatches. Qi2 is the next-generation wireless charging spec from the WPC, and it packs some exciting upgrades. The standard bumps the maximum wireless charging speed up from 7.5W to 15W and, more importantly, includes the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP). </p><p>Or so we thought. </p><p>The MPP can be viewed as an open-sourced version of Apple&apos;s proprietary magnetic connection system. That means that devices that support Qi2 and the MPP, by extension, could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones" target="_blank">connect to MagSafe chargers and other accessories</a>. Qi2 and the MPP have been talked about interchangeably in the lead-up to the standard&apos;s release. Since the WPC charges a lump sum to view the specification in its entirety — a fee to the tune of $18,000 — we all assumed that Qi2 <em>always</em> shipped with the MPP, but that isn&apos;t the case. </p><p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman points out that Qi2 and MPP are indeed separate in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1825607536747360703" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). Previously, it was thought that a device or accessory needed to support the MPP to earn the Qi2 specification. However, Rahman&apos;s discovery confirms that devices and accessories may feature Qi2 branding due to their support of 15W wireless charging while lacking magnets. </p>

<p>Rahman links to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231115984149/en/Qi-v2.0-Standard-for-Wireless-Charging-Is-Now-Ready-to-Provide-Enhanced-User-Experience" target="_blank">press release</a> from the WPC that plainly states the way that Qi, Qi2 MPP, and Qi2 extended power profile (EPP) will be used going forward. Qi is the EPP standard we&apos;re used to, with up to 7.5W wireless charging speeds. Devices and accessories that use the Qi2 spec with the MPP included can utilize the fancy new Qi2 logo to signify its magnetic capabilities. According to the WPC, devices and accessories that meet the Qi2 requirements over the EPP will be "branded with the existing Qi logo consumers know and use today."</p><p>If this is how the WPC is handling the Qi2 rollout and certification process — the linked press release is from November 2023, and there is some uncertainty around whether things have changed since then — there are pros and cons to its approach. It&apos;s great to know that if you see that Qi2 logo with the ring around it, you can be sure that your device supports both Qi2 charging speeds and has magnets. However, the original Qi spec has become convoluted in the process since it could support either 7.5W or 15W charging speeds — and there&apos;s no way to know which by the logo.</p><p>Android Central reached out to the Wireless Power Consortium for clarification on the Qi2 certification requirements and the logos currently in use. We did not hear back in time for publication, but we&apos;ll update this article when we do. </p>

<p>As someone who has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/peak-design-android-magsafe-accessories">following MagSafe (and later Qi2) on Android</a> for years, I&apos;m utterly perplexed by this development. Why is the WPC letting manufacturers certify their devices for Qi2 without including magnets? It&apos;s utterly unnecessary. Yes, it&apos;s true that Qi2 is about more than just magnets, namely when you consider the 15W charging speed. However, the 7.5W limitation hasn&apos;t stopped companies from offering faster charging speeds in the past through their own means — just look at what OnePlus has done with fast charging on its phones.</p><p>If the reason for the WPC permitting Qi2 devices that use the EPP was because it couldn&apos;t let Qi-branded devices offer more than 7.5W, that doesn&apos;t really make sense either. Qi2 products without magnets are still forced to use the old Qi logo anyway, so what&apos;s the point? This didn&apos;t have to be confusing, and now it is. </p><p>Right now, the vast majority of Qi2-enabled products include the MPP and are thus MagSafe-compatible. If companies do the right thing and add magnets to Qi2 chargers and accessories, the fact that the spec doesn&apos;t explicitly require them will become a tiny asterisk in the history of what should be a great standard. However, we have little reason to think that companies will do the right thing. For some reason, we&apos;ve yet to see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">flagship Android phone</a> shipped with Qi2 support — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a> is the only one to do so. </p><p>To put it simply, the rollout of Qi2 has been a mess so far. Google and Samsung both had numerous chances to add the standard to their smartphones, and they passed. We might&apos;ve given Samsung a pass when it launched the Galaxy S24 series in early 2024 and the Galaxy Z series this summer. But what&apos;s Google&apos;s excuse for not including it in the Google Pixel 9 lineup? </p><p>I don&apos;t know why more phones don&apos;t already feature Qi2, and I don&apos;t know why magnets aren&apos;t required. The whole point of Qi2 was to get the MagSafe experience on Android and other platforms, but no one really seems interested in making that a reality, at least not in 2024.</p>

I&apos;ll bet plenty of us know you can do it with a Pixel 9, though.</p><p>I&apos;m talking about the Pixel 9&apos;s new Pixel Studio and, by extension, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">"Reimagine" tool</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on" target="_blank">,</a> which is part of Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8" target="_blank">Magic Editor</a> software. Using these, you can transform a photo into something else or even create a photo out of thin air, and it often looks very believable—even if it&apos;s something that&apos;s 100% not real in any universe.</p>

<p>Google does this. You don&apos;t even need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">a Pixel 9</a> to create AI photos from your mind using Google because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">Google&apos;s ImageFX is a thing</a> and it works on any and every smartphone that can use Google Chrome, which is all of them.</p><p>And forget Google for a minute. There are plenty of other companies with mobile-friendly websites that will let you do the same as Pixel Studio. I found several places online that would create a picture of a chicken committing an act of terrorism, and it only took a few minutes. No, I&apos;m not telling you where to find them. You can use Google or<del> as I did</del> Bing. They&apos;re not hard to find.</p><p>Fun fact: none of those places were Google because it won&apos;t create anything, chicken or otherwise, committing terrorism. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15236074?visit_id=638599394150771349-2108561604&p=pixel_studio_restrictions&rd=1#image-restrictions">has rules</a> its AI tools and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy">people using them</a> have to follow, and if you can find a way to make it break them, there are places you can report it so Google can try to fix it.</p><p>Remember, AI is dumb, not intelligent, so things will slip through the cracks. A Google spokesperson <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224084/google-pixel-9-reimagine-ai-photos">told the Verge</a>, "At times, some prompts can challenge these tools’ guardrails, and we remain committed to continually enhancing and refining the safeguards we have in place."</p>
<p>I don&apos;t care about any of this. Shitty people with a shitty agenda will find a way to make shitty pictures and have been doing so for years and years. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-will-be-a-glorious-mess" target="_blank">AI is a dumpster fire,</a> but it&apos;s not some magical tool that makes these things possible; it simply lets people do them without spending five minutes learning a different way.</p><p>Use common sense and never believe something that seems unreal or stupid. You&apos;re not a robot, so use your brain, and everything will be OK.</p>

<p>What I do care about is all the pearl-clutching that happens whenever Google is involved. It&apos;s good to hate Google for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lawsuit-targets-chrome-privacy-sandbox">really dumb</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-antitrust-faq">evil things</a> it does, and we should hold it to a higher standard. Pretending that Google is at fault because bad people will do bad things is bad journalism, though.</p><p>You can use Bing or Duck Duck Go to find a website that works with your phone and do the same things Google&apos;s Magic Editor can do. You can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, or an iPhone. You can take Google completely out of the picture and get the very same kind of result, or an even worse result, because not every AI company has the same seemingly weak AI guardrails Google has in place.</p>

<p>When Apple releases its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">Image Playground</a> this fall, people will show off pictures of pigs snorting cocaine or kids locked in cages or some other random terrible shit. What won&apos;t happen is seeing tech publications writing and endlessly posting how bad Apple is for "allowing" it to happen.</p><p>The Google hate is often deserved. I do a fair share of it myself and think Google is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a super ethical or honest company. I&apos;m just not about writing rage bait or trying to make you click by saying Google is responsible for something bad people have always done.</p>

Turns out, you might want to invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-screen-protectors">screen protector for the Pixel Watch 3</a>, because Google&apos;s policy for broken models is that they will be replaced, not repaired.</p><p>A Google representative confirmed this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-watch-3-cant-be-repaired-3472994/">Android Authority</a>, stating that if you have a broken <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, you should check with "the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options."</p><p>This isn&apos;t that much of a surprise, given this was essentially the policy for the Pixel Watch 2 and its predecessor. And while not exact reason was given, it&apos;s likely due to the way the watch was designed, which may make it difficult to repair.</p><p>Instead, Google recommends users enroll in its Preferred Care program, which covers damages received, including "out-of-warranty issues." However, if you do end up needing to replace your watch, you&apos;ll have to fork over $49, and given the cost of the insurance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-no-repair-policy-should-not-surprise-you">you&apos;ll have to decide if it&apos;s worth it to you</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 3 is available for preorder now, so be sure to check out available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-best-google-pixel-watch-3-preorder-deals-how-to-buy-and-what-to-expect">preorder deals for the smartwatch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-astrophotography-manual-control"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>One of the best features on Pixel phones just got a little better. Thanks to the latest update to the Pixel Camera app, you can now manually trigger Astrophotography mode to capture pictures of the night sky.</p><p>Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> needed to be activated automatically by keeping the phone still and waiting for the mode to appear. Once the moon icon appeared on the shutter button, you were then able to activate the mode.</p><p>Now, users simply have to switch to Night Sight mode in the camera app, and Astro mode will appear on the slider, where you can adjust the timer (see image above).</p><p>It&apos;s certainly a handy change, especially for Pixel owners who may not have known how to enable Astrophotography mode. This should make it easier to take cool images of the night sky, especially if and when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/may-2024-northern-lights-pixel-8-pro-galaxy-s24-plus">northern lights</a> decide to make another appearance in lower latitudes.</p>

However, it&apos;s not just a new glow that this brings; this signals a notable change in how Gemini behaves, which will now bring up answers in a floating box instead of taking up the full screen.</p><p>The new UI will help users use Gemini more contextually.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-preorder-deals">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Ring</a> is making a big splash as the first product of its type from a major tech manufacturer. We&apos;ve seen smart rings before, but none have the ecosystem and brand recognition of a product from a company like Samsung.</p><p>And for many people, it&apos;s a great product. Like any tech product, it has drawbacks and strengths, but it fills a need for plenty of us. Smart rings are here to stay, at least until something even smaller and more inconspicuous comes along to replace them.</p>
<p>Smart rings are different in another way, too: they&apos;re disposable by design. This is not because a company like Samsung or Oura wants to build something with a short, useful life but because there&apos;s no way to do it differently.</p><p>Imagine a small circuit board, some sensors, a tiny battery, and plenty of epoxy, and you have what&apos;s needed to build a smart ring. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/98423/samsungs-galaxy-ring-revealed">Over at iFixit</a>, they&apos;ve taken the time to crack open a Galaxy Ring to demonstrate this, and this is why we love iFixit. What they found shouldn&apos;t surprise anyone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="6xoZGPGXg8jpunUChhWBDf" name="galaxy-ring-shell-and-electronics.jpg" alt="iFixit teardown photo of a Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6xoZGPGXg8jpunUChhWBDf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="667" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iFixit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is no way to service any parts on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> without ruining it. This isn&apos;t unique to Samsung&apos;s ring; every other model from any other company is going to be the same. There is no way to pack in the necessary tech and battery to power it and make the device serviceable without making it exorbitantly expensive. You wouldn&apos;t pay $800 for a smart ring, and neither would I.</p><p>This means more e-waste to deal with, but for us, it&apos;s not the big issue. That comes when we think about the lithium battery that powers the thing and how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">short the lifespan of a lithium battery is</a>.</p>
<p>The warranty period for a Galaxy Ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/legal/LGL10000282/">is 12 months</a>. I reached out to Samsung to see if there are any further details to consider but the company hasn&apos;t responded in time for publication. When it does, I&apos;ll be sure to add any information about it.</p><p>Twelve months is also about the lifespan of the tiny lithium battery inside of it. A battery of this type has a life measured in charging cycles, and after about 400 of them the battery starts to go bad — it won&apos;t hold as much charge and it loses its charge much faster. Fortunately, smart rings tend to have pretty good battery life, so you won&apos;t have to charge them as often as you would a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JQ854PVT2R6KqQcRGXJ8xS" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-hero-16-9.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring balanced inside its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQ854PVT2R6KqQcRGXJ8xS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So once you&apos;ve charged your ring about 400 times, you can expect the battery to stop being "good enough." It will still work, but not for very long, and for a product designed to be worn so it can read a bunch of health data, time on the finger and not the charger is very important.</p><p>Once you reach the point where the battery isn&apos;t lasting long enough to make it useful for you, the only thing you can do is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-recycle-your-old-android-phone">drop it in a recycle bin</a> somewhere and buy a new one for $400.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest problem here is that a smart ring&apos;s "disposability factor" kills any market for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/more-people-are-buying-usedrefurbished-phones-ever">used or refurbished devices</a>. Never buy a used smart ring unless you personally know how long it has been used for and how it was used. </p><p>A smart ring isn&apos;t like a phone where you can save a fistful of cash buying used and spend a little of it to get the battery swapped out. When the battery dies, it&apos;s either covered by the warranty, or it isn&apos;t. If it isn&apos;t, you&apos;re only option is to buy something else.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not trying to discourage anyone from buying a smart ring. For plenty of us, a few hundred dollars every year or so is a solid way to spend money in order to help live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>I&apos;m just pointing out what all the flashy ads you see aren&apos;t going to tell you: this cool product wasn&apos;t designed to last very long.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring lasts up to a week per charge, 10ATM and IP68 protection via the titanium frame, an ultra-lightweight design, and a complimentary charging cradle for on-the-go charging. It tracks a bunch of heart rate and sleep data passively, while being much more comfortable than a smartwatch.</p></p>

It's easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">best Google Pixel 9 deals</a> I've seen since the phone was first unveiled earlier this month, but don't expect it to be around for long. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1e720f4-a69c-4b11-a3c4-1d3c933b3e09" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Thanks to this deal, you can get Google&apos;s latest flagship phone alongside an <em>entire year</em> of T-Mobile-powered wireless for as little as $489 when you pay upfront (or $21 per month if you use affirm). Even if you sign up for Mint&apos;s most-expensive Unlimited plan, you&apos;re still looking at a max upfront payment of $579. That&apos;s over $200 less than you&apos;d pay if you bought the unlocked Pixel 9 by itself, and that&apos;s not even considering the value of covering your phone bill for a year. </p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> in the biz, Mint Mobile isn&apos;t a slouch when it comes to coverage either. Owned and operated by T-Mobile (and famously endorsed by Ryan Reynolds), Mint operates with a simple buy-in-bulk plan system that gives you access to the world&apos;s largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and calls to Mexico and Canada. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, on the other hand, comes packed with Google&apos;s latest AI-powered technology, excellent cameras, and the efficiency of the Tensor G4 chipset. You also get seven years of OS updates guaranteed, which means you could be using this phone long after you say goodbye to Mint (if you decide to do so).</p>

<hr>
<p>Yet again, Meta has reportedly canceled development for the Quest Pro 2 XR headset.</p><p>The report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset">The Information</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset" target="_blank">,</a> which states that "Meta employees" informed the publication about a canceled "high-end mixed reality" project (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reportedly-canceled-quest-pro-2/" target="_blank">Upload VR</a>). The device in question is codenamed "La Jolla," which was stated to be the Meta Quest Pro 2. Supposedly, the Reality Labs team working on the project wanted to keep costs low and sell the device for under $1,000.</p><p>Sources add that those ambitions were becoming increasingly difficult due to the "high cost of displays." The headset was supposedly preparing to debut with a micro OLED display, which in itself is already "difficult to produce." The technology is similar to what Apple provides in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rogue-ascent-quest-best-hand-tracking-game">Vision Pro</a>. The report claims that the Reality Labs team ran into cost troubles as the technology required ran high.</p><p>Notable Meta members like CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth reportedly delivered the news. However, Bosworth states this isn&apos;t the whole story.</p><p>Meta&apos;s CTO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@boztank/post/C_BS8BuPfQZ?xmt=AQGzV74gtS5uN6t1G3Q7yIDQdyw2fehy19rrWNh-N2dTjA" target="_blank">took to Threads</a> to voice his side, stating, "We have many prototypes in development at all times. But we don&apos;t bring all of them to production." Bosworth added, "we move forward with some, we pass on others."</p>

<p>With that, it&apos;s clear that "La Jolla" was simply one cog in the Quest Pro 2 project machine. This isn&apos;t the first time that a version of the XR headset has been dropped. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/2024s-quest-pro-2-is-officially-canceled-but-thats-not-the-end">In March 2023</a>, Bosworth said that a device codenamed "Cardiff," which was supposed to take on the Quest Pro 2 moniker, got canceled. Instead, the company shifted toward a new adventure: "La Jolla."</p><p>Meta teased at the time that La Jolla would "feature photorealistic avatars" when it launched. Based on what Bosworth said in his recent Threads post, "La Jolla" has likely fallen into the "pass" category as Meta shifts its sights to better align with its goals for an XR headset. Meta has not confirmed that the Pro 2 is gone for good.</p><p>The Meta Quest Pro 2 had a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lg-made-meta-quest-pro-2-canceled">report surfaced in June</a>, making us feel like we&apos;re in a time loop. LG reportedly backed out of the project for a high-performance XR headset. The company has reallocated its personnel from the XR business to other areas as the former no longer aligns with its internal projections. It&apos;s stated that LG would remain on board with Meta for R&D purposes.</p><p>In other news, Meta announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-nervous-about-meta-horizon-os">Horizon OS</a>, the next iteration of its Quest OS. Despite the company moving in a very Google-esque way, its debut caused more concern than awe.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is already several OS updates ahead of Mobvoi and will continue to widen the software gap. Its durability, ultra-bright display, fast performance, and three-day battery life make it one of the best Wear OS watches out there, but it's also a bit too expensive for many buyers.</p></p>

<p>Among Wear OS watches, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro represents a battle for the title of best battery life. Both can last several days in normal conditions or extend their lifespans with battery-saver modes. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> has plenty of upsides over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, primarily its more advanced software. But given that the Enduro has very similar specs and sensors to the Ultra, weighs much less, and costs nearly half as much, it&apos;s certainly a reasonable alternative!</p><p>While the Galaxy Watch Ultra is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> today, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro gives it a run for its money as a premium smartwatch. Here are all of the main Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro differences to help you make your choice.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HmcTNNQwbAcxQDmWvLuspb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-apps.jpeg" alt="The app drawer on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmcTNNQwbAcxQDmWvLuspb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung&apos;s all-titanium Ultra case looks stylish and pleasingly contoured but painfully thick and a little too heavy unless you&apos;re used to heavy watches. Samsung claims it&apos;s only 12.1mm thick, but it&apos;s really closer to 16mm once you account for the unmeasured sensor bump.</p><p>The 11.95mm TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro also measures thicker than its spec sheet, but it&apos;s still about 1mm skinnier and weighs 15.8g/ 0.56oz less, primarily because Mobvoi used aluminum instead of titanium, except for the ridged steel bezel.</p><p>Samsung offers more band options than Mobvoi&apos;s single rubber option, including the thick, water-repellent Marine, comfortable and lightweight Trail, and more generic, sporty Peakform.</p><p>While aesthetics is a matter of opinion, the Galaxy Watch Ultra will look more stylish to most people, if a bit cartoonishly thick from the side, while the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has more of a sporty, everyday appearance in line with other fitness watches.</p><p>Both watches have a claimed MIL-STD-810H rating. Samsung specifies that the Ultra can withstand "high/ low temperatures, altitude, humidity, immersion, salt, fog, dust, vibration, and drops," while Mobvoi doesn&apos;t specify how rugged it is in certain conditions or if it only withstands drops. We do know the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has a more standard 5ATM water protection rating, while the Ultra hits 10ATM.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3281px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="F6C2nwA7DGLpsCDHvWgpTS" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-hero-16x9.jpeg" alt="TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6C2nwA7DGLpsCDHvWgpTS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3281" height="1846" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mobvoi gave the Enduro a Sapphire crystal lens to protect the display, one of the few improvements over the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> with Gorilla Glass. That matches Samsung&apos;s watch display for scratch protection.</p><p>Both watches only come in one display size, cutting out small-wristed folks who want better battery life and a lighter design. While Samsung&apos;s AMOLED watch display is slightly larger, they share the same pixels per inch (PPI), about 320.</p><p>Where Samsung clearly wins the head-to-head battle is brightness. Mobvoi doesn&apos;t advertise its display nits, so we assume it hits only 1,000 nits or less with adaptive brightness; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobvoi-TicWatch-Pro-5-Smartwatch-Review-Does-a-lot-and-lasts-just-as-long.738093.0.html">Notebook Check</a> only measured a 472-nit maximum on the TicWatch Pro 5, and we don&apos;t think Mobvoi updated anything besides the sapphire glass. By comparison, Samsung gave the Watch Ultra a vivid 3,000-nit max, making it really easy to read in direct sunlight.</p><p>Mobvoi&apos;s unique display quirk is its Ultra-low-power display, seated atop the AMOLED, for switching to "Essential" mode. You can choose from different backlight colors but otherwise the watch face will be black text, numbers, and symbols on a blank background, and it extends the watch&apos;s battery life by days, or even weeks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3tTzutDY4ngKuVpkBvovBN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-close-up.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its three buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tTzutDY4ngKuVpkBvovBN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung&apos;s other display advantage (sort of) is its digital bezel around the edge, letting you scan quickly through Tiles by sliding your fingertip along it. Many people prefer the physical rotating bezel found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, but this solution avoids making the Ultra any heavier.</p><p>The TicWatch 5 Pro Enduro has a more traditional crown along the right edge, but only Mobvoi redesigned it from the standard Pro, so it&apos;s "less flush with the side casing and easier to scroll," according to our reviewer. It also has a secondary side button.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>&apos;s two-button layout, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has a third, orange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">Quick Button</a> that enables shortcuts like pausing or restarting a workout or triggering an emergency siren, and it looks quite svelte. Our only disappointment is that Samsung didn&apos;t make this button a crown as an alternative to the digital bezel, so that you have easier controls during workouts.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="FUsv4CENm4HJUtjVwoj6vR" name="ticwatch-pro-5-and-pro-5-enduro-side-1.jpeg" alt="TicWatch Pro 5 vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUsv4CENm4HJUtjVwoj6vR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The TicWatch Pro 5 and 5 Enduro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both watches have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage but rely on different CPUs. Mobvoi employs the same Snapdragon W5 chip as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, with four Arm Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz and a 22nm co-processor (250MHz) for background tasks. Samsung developed its own Exynos W1000 CPU with one Cortex-A78 (1.6GHz) and four Cortex-A55 (1.5GHz). </p><p>In other words, even though Samsung&apos;s new chip isn&apos;t clocked quite as high, it has one extra high-end core that helps speed through tasks quickly. Because of that, both watches speed through tasks and load apps quickly.</p><p>Samsung gave its watch better connectivity options than Mobvoi: The Ultra supports LTE, Wi-Fi 5GHz, and Bluetooth 5.3, while the Enduro has no cellular option, defaults to Wi-Fi 2.4GHz, and has Bluetooth 5.2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG reading on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of health and fitness sensors, both share an accelerometer and gyroscope for tracking arm movements, GPS and a compass for tracking and navigation, a barometer for elevation data, continuous heart rate data, and blood oxygen and skin temperature data at night. </p><p>Only the Galaxy Watch Ultra has dual-band GPS tracking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test" target="_blank">which performed well in our fitness testing</a> against a dual-band Garmin watch and for heart rate data against a heart rate strap. </p><p>The TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has a serious fitness focus. Its detailed TicHealth app allows you to track your workout progress without a subscription, even if it&apos;s not as popular as Samsung Health. We simply wish it had dual-band GPS, as well.</p><p>Both have irregular heart rhythm warnings, though only Samsung has an active ECG sensor for clearer confirmation of any issues. Samsung has a body composition sensor (BIA) for calculating your body fat and muscle percentages, though we&apos;ve found it to be fairly inaccurate compared to smart scale data. Unfortunately, you&apos;ll need a Samsung phone to access your AFib data, which is a frustrating choice for Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5pS3aGG3vpRrvQ7vr3NQhU" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-oneplus-open-mobvoi-health.jpeg" alt="Mobvoi Health on the OnePlus Open and TicWatch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pS3aGG3vpRrvQ7vr3NQhU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big question, of course, is battery life. The TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has an extra 38mAh capacity, a slightly smaller display, and a dimmer backlight than the Ultra, which theoretically helps it last longer. </p><p>According to each company&apos;s spec sheets, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro lasts 90 hours in the standard Smart mode or a whopping 45 days in Essential mode with the secondary display; the Galaxy Watch Ultra lasts 60 hours with the always-on display (AOD) active, 100 hours in Power Saving mode, or 16 hours with dual-band GPS.</p><p>In practice, our TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro reviewer called it "the Energizer bunny that just keeps going" and praised how it consistently lasted a few days per charge. The Galaxy Watch Ultra had issues with power drain initially but became much more efficient with post-launch updates. It actually lasts longer than its 60-hour w/AOD estimate, though it still won&apos;t quite catch the Enduro for longevity.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and will receive four major OS updates, plus four years of security updates. Google and Samsung coordinate on annual releases, so Samsung is always the first to receive new software, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung watches</a> let you choose between Google or Samsung apps for default functions, like Google Assistant or Bixby.</p><p>The TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-3">Wear OS 3.5</a>. Although the Pro 5 series began an internal Wear OS 4 beta test in April 2024, we&apos;ve yet to see an official release. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> adds better data backups and transfers between phones, Gmail and Calendar apps, and (most importantly) Google Assistant support. At the moment, TicWatches can only use Alexa as an assistant.</p><p>However long it takes Mobvoi to implement Wear OS 4, it&apos;s clear that the company will never catch up with Samsung and Google for software. Our reviewer harped on this issue in particular, saying he hadn&apos;t expected Mobvoi to release a new watch version without fixing its software delays first.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a long-lasting smartwatch in terms of software, battery life, ruggedness, and its future-proofed CPU. That might be enough to justify spending its high $650 price tag, especially if you can find a good trade-in deal to cut down on the price.</p><p>Still, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro costs hundreds less and is often found on sale, while offering comparable performance, battery life, and display quality, along with a lighter design and the upside of its low-energy dual display and crown controls. If it weren&apos;t for the software issues, the Enduro would be an easy recommendation.</p><p>Considering those, it&apos;s tricky to suggest buying the Enduro when we have no guarantee about Wear OS 4&apos;s timetable or the possibility of future updates. It depends on whether you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" target="_blank">Wear OS watch</a> for cutting-edge smarts and voice assistant commands or if you&apos;re happy enough with actionable notifications and a ton of health data.</p>
