<ul><li>Google Home and Nest products experienced an issue that led speakers and displays to become unresponsive this week.</li><li>The problem specifically affected verbal commands, even those as simple as "What's the weather?".</li><li>Google says the issue should be resolved for most users now, and is investigating what caused the problem.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google said today it resolved widespread issues with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> and Nest products not responding to commands that plagued users for nearly a week. First reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-nest-hub-audio-not-responding-3512418/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the problems left Home and Nest speakers and displays incapable of answering even the most basic questions, like the time or the weather. The company is still investigating what caused the problems, but confirmed most users shouldn't experience the unresponsiveness now.</p><p>"The team is still investigating the root cause but have resolved the issue, so all users should be up and running now," a Google spokesperson explained.</p><p>The problems, which specifically affected voice commands, can be traced back to at least Dec. 30 as evidenced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/316085133/my-google-home-devices-stopped-responding-to-certain-questions-about-3-days-ago?hl=en" target="_blank">posts</a> on Google's support forum (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/02/google-home-nest-speakers-basic-commands-not-working/#more-655787" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Although the Nest Hub displays in particular showed the correct weather and time, the voice assistant requests would hang up when asking for the same information. The displays showed a perpetual loading screen and couldn't respond to basic requests.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1hpkzfg/google_home_mini_1st_gen_suddenly_just_keeps">Google Home Mini (1st Gen) Suddenly just keeps "thinking" and doesn't do anything?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Certain requests, like smart home or media control, were still functional. However, anything that required a Home or Nest speaker or display to fetch a response would fail. Luckily, it appears that the issues are resolved. Android Authority reported that its issues were no longer affecting its units, and Android Central tested that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Google Home Hub</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> were both able to respond to requests.</p>

<p>It's unclear what caused the speakers and displays to become unable to respond to requests over the last week or so. The bug could be related to how Google Home and Nest products decide which one will respond to requests, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/316289033?hl=en&msgid=316411721&sjid=14626752115136997191-NC">support posts indicate</a> people with multiple speakers or displays were adversely affected.</p><p>Google support and Reddit posts chronicled the understandable frustration of users, but at least the issues appear to be resolved for now.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following the Biden administration's brief revival of net neutrality, a federal appeals court decided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not have the authority to impose those rules on internet service providers (ISPs). The controversial set of net neutrality rules have been the topic of fierce debates for nearly a decade, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/25a0002p-06.pdf" target="_blank">court's ruling</a> means they may be gone for good. More importantly, the decision sets further precedent that limits federal agencies' ability to regulate big tech, in aspects such as right-to-repair.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/why-net-neutrality-is-so-important#xenforo-comments-1067621">net neutrality</a> was a set of rules that essentially forced ISPs to treat all internet traffic equally. It didn't matter which website you wanted to reach or where you were located — ISPs couldn't give certain domains preference over another.</p><p>Why would an ISP want to do that? Comcast, for example, owns Xfinity, which represents 40% of all broadband internet subscriptions and is the nation-leading ISP by far, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/217348/us-broadband-internet-susbcribers-by-cable-provider/" target="_blank">Statista</a>. It also owns NBCUniversal, which hosts streaming service Peacock. Without net neutrality, Comcast could — in theory — prioritize Peacock streams over Netflix streams to put its own interests ahead of those of its subscribers.</p><p>So, that's the argument for net neutrality. The argument <em>against</em> net neutrality is that it will result in customers paying more for internet service. Think about it: If ISPs were allowed to slow down internet speeds of certain sites, it could demand that the companies hosting those sites pay for better preference. Without net neutrality, deals with big-name sites serve as a supplemental revenue sources for ISPs — revenue that would otherwise be attained by charging average people more.</p>

<p>For years, the FCC struggled to correctly classify ISPs. It started by calling them "information services" in 2005, which would not give the FCC authority to impose regulations upon them. Then, it shifted course in 2010, passing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-open-internet-order" target="_blank">Open Internet Order</a>. Broadband providers sued to block the FCC's first stab at net neutrality rules and were successful, because the courts decided the FCC could only regulate "common carriers," like airlines, railroads, and some telecom companies.</p><p>It was settled — or so we thought. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama gave the green light for the FCC to reclassify broadband internet providers as common carriers. Thus, giving the FCC the authority to impose net neutrality rules as they are known today. Once again, it seemed settled, until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fcc-unveils-plans-roll-back-net-neutrality-rules">FCC decided to roll back net neutrality under then-President Trump in 2017</a>.</p><p>Finally, net neutrality got a second chance under President Biden, although it immediately faced grim legal challenges. That brings us to the present, when a federal appeals court struck down net neutrality seemingly for good with the help of newly-minted Supreme Court precedent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5696px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yguQyZmBzYCV5yVGjLRKg7" name="asus-rog-gt-ax6000-review-top-angle-2.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Rapture GT-AX6000 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yguQyZmBzYCV5yVGjLRKg7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5696" height="3204" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of what you think about net neutrality, this decision is monumental. It's a confirmation of what was expected when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a legal principle established through precedent with the case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in 1984. The practice became known as Chevron deference, and it essentially meant that courts would give deference to expert regulatory agencies' interpretation of laws when deciding cases.</p><p>Why would the courts give deference to executive branch agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or FCC? The reasoning was twofold. For one, these cases usually concerned complex issues that the average federal judge was likely not an expert on, whereas regulator agencies are the authoritative subject matter experts in their respective fields.</p><p>Additionally, there was the thought that executive branch agencies were best fit to make major policy decisions because they could be held accountable by voters — we saw this in practice as net neutrality tumbled through the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations.</p><p>When the Supreme Court killed the idea of Chevron deference last year, it gave courts nationwide the precedent to favor their own interpretation of the laws rather than those of regulatory agencies.</p><p>That's precisely how we got here. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals didn't agree with the FCC's classification of ISPs as common carriers, and didn't think the FCC had the authority to impose net neutrality rules. For the first time in decades, the court's opinion held more weight than the agencies' opinion.</p><p>"Unlike past challenges that the D.C. Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC’s reading of the statute," the judges wrote in their decision. "We acknowledge that the workings of the Internet are complicated and dynamic, and that the FCC has significant expertise in overseeing ‘this technical and complex area," they continue, adding that the agency's interpretation "cannot be used to overwrite the plain meaning of the statute."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7LntyxXZXQa3m2A83P8z9T" name="expressvpn-aircove-wifi-6-router-review-wide.jpg" alt="ExpressVPN Aircove Wi-Fi 6 router AX1800" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LntyxXZXQa3m2A83P8z9T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The decision is not only a massive blow to net neutrality, but also a hit to big tech regulation in general. If executive branch agencies — such as the FCC or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-suing-to-block-cfpb-oversight-over-google-pay-calling-it-government-overreach">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</a> or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), can't reign in tech companies without explicit laws giving them the authority to do so — progress may stall.</p><p>That reality puts even more pressure on U.S. Congress to enact laws that regulate big tech, which can withstand judicial scrutiny.</p><p>"Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair," said Jessica Rosenworcel, the FCC chair, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408575A1.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a>. "With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law."</p><p>If you've followed hot-button technology policy topics of late — think net neutrality, right-to-repair, antitrust, and interoperability — you'll know just how hard it is to get Congress to agree on these issues. Now that the Chevron deference is gone, and the new precedent has been applied to big tech for the first time, agencies will have limited leeway to regulate these conglomerates. Only time will tell how that, plus the transition to the Trump administration later this month, will affect the real progress made in big tech regulation over the last few years.</p>

Its hybrid driver IEMs are well respected in audiophile circles even though they’ve only had products on the market since 2014.</p><p>When I considered the FoKus Apollo and all that it offers, three things immediately stood out: sound quality across the spectrum, the included accessories, and boom mic quality. The price point also stands out, but whether the price is "good" will be subjective.</p><p>The Noble FoKus Apollo isn’t for the faint of <del>heart</del> wallet, but if you’re an audiophile and looking to mate an excellent pair of headphones to the devices in our best DACs list, you’ll have to look around a bit to find a pair of Bluetooth over-ear headphones that sound better.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4VhHJeMscZy2eXjEeCrW4E" name="noble-fokus-apollo-with-box-on-stand.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo on a headphone stand, next to the retail packaging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VhHJeMscZy2eXjEeCrW4E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I first began listening to the new Noble FoKus Apollo, which was just released at the end of 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nobleaudio.com/products/fokus-apollo?srsltid=AfmBOoo8B4Bn7vddNA37eBd57OC6DJ_I4Fzk_M6Qp-8IvKSE6WoMM6P5" target="_blank">for $650</a>, I picked up some auditory masking of the mids and highs. I thought it was the 40mm dynamic driver shading the 14.5mm planar magnetic driver, but that wasn’t the issue.</p><p>Though the app is pretty bare bones, it does come with a 10-band EQ to help with any sonic issues you may have with its sound curve. You don't really need a lot of features in the app because the cans come with physical controls for most of the functionality.</p><p>I don’t know if it was burn-in, my ears adjusting, or the personalized sound feature, but there isn’t the slightest hint of masking anymore, and these headphones are some of the most balanced I’ve had the opportunity to have in my lab.</p><p>For testing, I connected wired and wirelessly to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, Astell&Kern P1 DAP, iMac Pro, and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. For my wired connections, I used the iFi Go Link Max and Fiio/Jade Audio KA11 DAC dongles, though the FoKus Apollo <em>does </em>come with a USB-C cable for wired audio playback, and you’ll want to use it. I’ll explain.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="bYe3oYd56e3SQMxykb9nBC" name="noble-fokus-apollo-aux-cable-attached-alt2.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo showing cables and adapters, connected to A&K P1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYe3oYd56e3SQMxykb9nBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I aired out the FoKus Apollo’s sonic abilities with a healthy mix of bass, electronic, and acoustic audio treats, which included tracks from Charles Mingus, The Roots, Composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Michael Abels with the London Contemporary Orchestra, Jamiroquai, Skrillex, and Nina Simone.</p><p>The instrumentation, sound stage, and clarity in Mingus’ rousing romp, “Moanin’” is sublime. The mix of dynamic and planar drivers is apparent in the satisfying thump of the upright bassline, balanced by the masterfully played tenor and alto saxophones.</p><p>The FoKus Apollo gives you that “in your head” audio experience, and you <em>feel</em> every note of that with “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” motion picture original soundtrack. This aggressive violin piece will show how much clarity and texture your headphones reproduce. Using the FoKus Apollo, the chord changes, attack, and decay come alive. The way the tension between the bow and strings is produced makes it feel like you’re sitting next to the violinist.</p><p>All of the music I immersed myself in during the review period was a joy to listen to through the Apollo. It’s well appointed with all you need in the box to take in all the sonic glory, no matter your preferred delivery method. You get a 3.5mm cable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a> for charging and audio pass-thru, and 4.4mm and ¼” adapters. Wireless connectivity happens via a Qualcomm Bluetooth stack utilizing Bluetooth LE, aptX/aptX HD, and LDAC support.</p><p>With all of that connectivity, the USB-C connection really brought out the most detail in the music I listened to. The balanced 4.4mm adapter also made an audible difference regarding how it extended the sound stage and bass.</p>

<p>Noble Audio’s attention to detail is apparent in the FoKus Apollo’s design and “packaging.” At $650, you don’t feel like they cut corners or cheaped out on accouterments like some competitors.</p><p>As I stated, the Apollo comes with everything you need in the box, so there is no need to track down compatible third-party cables and accessories unless you really want to.</p><p>The hard case is thiccc (yes, three C’s thicc) and will take up a lot of space in a backpack, purse, or luggage, but it is well appointed and offers excellent protection from its EVA shell. Inside are pockets for your cables and a velvet pouch for your adapters.</p><p>Let me take a brief moment to say that the 3.5mm cable is beefy! The metal connectors and cable thickness are worthy of the premium price point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="kRv3FTuQFQr4QeRrCAqiaD" name="noble-fokus-apollo-earpads.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo showing earcups and headband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRv3FTuQFQr4QeRrCAqiaD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The headphones themselves have soft Alcantara on the headband’s contact surface and pleather-wrapped memory foam replaceable earpads, all set on an anodized aluminum frame, making the headphones comfortable for extended listening sessions.</p><p>The earpads are large enough to fit comfortably around my ears without feeling constricting, unlike some other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">high-end headphones</a> I’ve reviewed.</p>
<p>The physical buttons are responsive, and intuitive. Having a physical mute botton on them is also a nice touch.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-use-improvement-2">What could use improvement?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bujyZxH3FZdW7S2pLQzbVB" name="noble-fokus-apollo-on-headphone-stand.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo on a headphone stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bujyZxH3FZdW7S2pLQzbVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the cans swivel to fit inside their case and adjust to your unique head shape, they don’t fold, so their footprint is large. Hybrid active noise cancellation and internal mic audio are both ok.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-1000xm5-vs-bose-quietcomfort-45" target="_blank">Sony and Bose</a> won’t be getting a run for their money as the headphones let in some highs when noise canceling is active, but they work just fine for <em>dampening</em> urban noise and airplane engine hum.</p><p>I will say that built-in microphone audio quality is underwhelming at this price point, especially given how stellar the headphone’s music playback is.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="76f3yEwwz2cgbb3VYJFqqD" name="noble-fokus-apollo-boom-mic-attached.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo with the excellent boom microphone attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/76f3yEwwz2cgbb3VYJFqqD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The saving grace here is that the included boom mic attachment sounds <em>great!</em> So, if you’re using these at home, in the office, for taking work-related phone calls, or for Zoom meetings, you’ll have great microphone quality with the boom that competes with some of today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones" target="_blank">best noise-canceling headphones.</a></p><p>Out of the box, without EQ, the sound quality is solid. Even with that, I’d love it if they added the ability to control bandwidth to the Noble app’s 10-band EQ. Being an audiophile product, having the ability to adjust Q is always a welcomed addition.</p><p>I’d also like the ability to adjust ANC and transparency modes. While the transparency mode is excellent, I’d like full ANC and to see what that sounds like on these headphones instead of full-time hybrid ANC.</p>
<h2 id="a-sound-audiophile-option-2">A sound audiophile option</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VWAdTZzVdCtavE36ArCydD" name="noble-fokus-apollo-earcups-backside-alt.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo showing the outside of the earcups" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWAdTZzVdCtavE36ArCydD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Noble Audio has something special here. Though these are aimed at the wireless market, the “FoKus” is clearly on sound quality, and I’m good with that. The combination of a large, 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar magnetic produces a bright sound with “in your head” clarity while delivering deep bass and rousing mids. The overall package is entertaining, engaging, and comfortable, with everything you need to enjoy your favorite sounds right there in the box.</p><p>Whether you’re listening via Bluetooth, USB-C, or 3.5mm/4.4mm/ 1/4” cable, if you have the coin, the Noble FoKus Apollo are worth it, with one caveat: if you’re ok using the boom mic attachment for your most important phone calls. And I’ll say it again: if you’re dipping your toes into the audiophile pool, invest in a great pair of headphones <em>before</em> you spend a bunch of money on your audio source and accessories, like a DAC or DAP.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new leak revealed that both the OnePlus 13 and 13 R might get a Sandstone magnetic case, with the 13 possibly offering Aramid Fiber and Wood Grain Magnetic Half-Pack cases.</li><li>Sandstone cases offer great grip with their sandpaper-like texture, while Aramid Fiber cases provide strong protection without the bulk.</li><li>The magnetic cases will easily snap on and likely work with other magnetic accessories like Qi2 wireless chargers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is preparing for the global launch of its next flagship series. Ahead of the unveiling, official cases for the OnePlus 13 and 13R have surfaced online, and they might be getting a smart new upgrade.</p><p>Leaker Sudhanshu Ambhore hopped on X to give us a sneak peek at the case lineup for the OnePlus 13 series. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and 13R are tipped to get a Sandstone magnetic case, but the OnePlus 13 might step it up with a more premium selection, including an Aramid Fiber magnetic case and a unique Wood Grain Magnetic Half-Pack case.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 13 series offiical cases.OnePlus 13R Sandstone Magnetic CaseOnePlus 13 Sandstone Magnetic CaseOnePlus 13 Aramid Fiber Magnetic CaseOnePlus 13 Wood Grain Magnetic Half-pack Case pic.twitter.com/i8af14N2fe<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1874726042465927669">January 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>OnePlus’ Sandstone cases are a classic for a reason. With their fine sandpaper-like texture, these cases not only look sleek but also deliver better grip, keeping accidental slips at bay.</p><p>Meanwhile, Aramid Fiber cases are all about tough protection without the bulk, thanks to their lightweight yet super-strong build. And if you’ve got a soft spot for OnePlus’ old-school wood grain cases, the Wood Grain Magnetic Half-pack option is the perfect mix of style and practicality.</p>

<p>The leaker points out that these cases are magnetic, so they’ll easily snap onto your phone. Plus, they’ll probably work perfectly with other magnetic accessories, like Qi2 wireless chargers.</p><p>OnePlus recently unveiled some magnetic accessories for the OnePlus 13 in China, so expect them to hit global markets soon. OnePlus President Kinder Liu previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-bringing-its-own-spin-on-magsafe">confirmed </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-bringing-its-own-spin-on-magsafe" target="_blank">that the phone will support magnetic wireless charging</a>, showing that the company is ready to jump on the growing trend of magnetic accessories, just like other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium smartphones</a>.</p><p>While OnePlus heard the love for past bamboo cases, Liu made it clear that it won’t be making a comeback for the OnePlus 13. Instead, OnePlus will offer stylish wood-grain covers with a "magnetic suction function."</p><p>Apple has had the MagSafe advantage for a while, with a whole ecosystem of magnetic accessories. Android users, on the other hand, have had to deal with third-party adapters to get something similar.</p><p>That said, 2025 is about to flip the script. With more brands jumping on the Qi2 wireless charging bandwagon and building their own magnetic accessory collections, Android is finally bringing that same smooth, convenient experience Apple users have been living with.</p>

<p>When we first reviewed the Motorola Edge 2024, it was priced at $550 and didn't have the hardware to match that price point. Fast forward half a year, and the Motorola Edge 2024 is routinely available for under $300. At such a low cost, the Edge 2024 is a lot easier to consider — even if it comes with a few compromises compared to modern flagships.</p><p>If you're looking for a new smartphone, you might be wondering how much you really need to spend to get a great experience. This comparison will help you out because we're comparing the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 to the Motorola Edge 2024. One is a midrange phone now priced like a budget device, and the other is a bona-fide flagship. Let's figure out which one is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> for you (and which is the best value).</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-motorola-edge-2024-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Motorola Edge 2024: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-04.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first glance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge 2024</a> might appear cheap-looking compared to the Galaxy S25's rumored design. Samsung's next flagship is expected to feature a glass back, brushed aluminum rails, and large DSLR-style camera bumps. By comparison, the Motorola Edge 2024 features a vegan leather back and only one Midnight Blue colorway. It does have aluminum rails, but from afar, Motorola's design language doesn't stand out.</p><p>The good news is that the in-hand feel of the Motorola Edge 2024 is much better, according to our reviewer. There's a curved display and back panel that makes the phone more comfortable to hold than rectangular, boxy flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. Additionally, the vegan leather material adds a grippy feel compared to slippery glass or plastic. In other words, don't underestimate the Motorola Edge 2024's design.</p><p>The full specs of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> aren't known for sure, but we can infer that the Motorola Edge 2024 will be bigger than Samsung's base-model flagship. Motorola's midranger has a 6.6-inch pOLED display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. The Galaxy S25 is expected to get a bigger screen this year, but it'll only be bumped to 6.2 inches, so it'll still be smaller than the Motorola Edge 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-look-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="An angled, rumored rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Samsung continues its longtime design trends with the Galaxy S25, that phone should be smaller and lighter than the Motorola Edge 2024. The latter measures 159.63 x 71.99 x 7.99mm and weighs 174 grams, whereas the Galaxy S24 weighed just 168 grams. The Samsung Galaxy S25 might be great for people who want a compact phone, but the Motorola Edge 2024 gives you the chance to get a screen roughly the size of a Galaxy S25 Plus on a budget.</p><p>While the Motorola Edge 2024 does have a camera bump, it's much smaller than the Galaxy S25's camera housing is expected to be. Overall, Motorola's design language is less flashy. Although the company calls the phone's color Midnight Blue, it's basically black.</p>

<p>Both phones expectedly feature a hole-punch selfie camera, USB-C, and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">an IP68 dust and water-resistance rating.</a> If you like unique colors, you'll have to get the Galaxy S25 — it is expected to come in Moon Night Blue, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Blue, and Sparkling Green.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-motorola-edge-2024-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Motorola Edge 2024: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>In terms of hardware, the Samsung Galaxy S25 will blow the Motorola Edge 2024 out of the water. Of course, that's because the Motorola Edge 2024 will likely be multiple hundreds of dollars cheaper than Samsung's upcoming flagship. Still, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip is all but certain to power the Galaxy S25 and will trounce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> in the Motorola Edge 2024.</p><p>There are some areas where the Motorola Edge 2024 will beat out the Galaxy S25, though. For starters, the Edge 2024 supports 68W wired charging speeds, which are much higher than anything Samsung has offered in the past. Additionally, the Edge 2024 has a 5,000mAh battery capacity. While it's rumored that Samsung will bump the Galaxy S25's capacity to 5,000mAh, it's not confirmed yet.</p>

<p>Camera performance is one area where the Galaxy S25 will shine. It's expected to have a triple-camera system with a 50MP wide lens, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10MP telephoto lens. On the front, there's rumored to be a 12MP selfie camera.</p><p>While the Motorola Edge 2024 does have a 50MP main camera, Samsung has the superior sensor and computational photography. Plus, the Edge 2024 only offers a dual-camera layout. There's a 13MP ultrawide and no telephoto lens, something that may be sorely missed in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-motorola-edge-2024-performance-and-software-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Motorola Edge 2024: Performance and software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i4pZZvLZrTTi5FZhp67c5U" name="motorola-edge-2024-hello-moto.jpg" alt="The Motorola Edge (2024)'s pOLED display showing the boot logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4pZZvLZrTTi5FZhp67c5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance and software are ticks in favor of the Samsung Galaxy S25, largely thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset inside it. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, but it's much bigger than an annual upgrade. This processor uses the same custom Oryon cores as Qualcomm's Snapdragon X platform and is faster as a result. Meanwhile, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 inside the Motorola Edge 2024 is firmly a midrange chip — it's not on the same level as the company's flagship processors.</p><p>The extra power of the Samsung Galaxy S25 will help it provide artificial intelligence features now and in the future. The phone will likely come with new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> that top what Motorola can offer. Additionally, the seven years of software support you get with modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> will keep them up and running for years to come. By comparison, Motorola's software support is notoriously poor.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 will only get two major Android updates and three years of security patches. It started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is already out, so software support is already nearing the end. It also takes Motorola a while to update its phones to new Android versions, which is another thing to consider. If longevity and performance are top priorities, you may want to avoid the Motorola Edge 2024.</p>

<p>It might seem easy to want the Motorola Edge 2024 at its attractive price point, however, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is likely to be the better value. Although the Motorola Edge 2024 is serviceable, it'll only get one more Android OS upgrade despite costing $300 at the time of publishing. On the other hand, the Galaxy S25 will start with Android 15 and get seven more Android OS upgrades after that.</p><p>If you can make the Galaxy S25 last the full seven years, or even half that, it'll probably be a better value than buying the middling Motorola Edge 2024.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is redesigning Good Lock, the company's first-party launcher known for bringing advanced features to Galaxy phones, with One UI 7.</li><li>The app will be available in "all countries" and on the Google Play Store for the first time.</li><li>Certain features are getting a boost, like Home Up, which can now be used with One UI Home without the app active.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Good Lock, the popular first-party Samsung launcher for enthusiasts, is getting a redesign and expansion with One UI 7. In a post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/good-lock/굿락-one-ui-7-업데이트-소식/td-p/31156891" target="_blank">Samsung community forum</a>, the feature manager detailed Good Lock changes that will arrive with the release of One UI 7. Samsung is trying to make the upgraded Good Lock launcher ready for release alongside the regular One UI update, but certain features might take longer to release.</p><p>Notably, Samsung is making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> more widely available. Previously exclusive to the Galaxy Store, the app will be available for download from the Google Play Store starting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>. For the first time, the post reveals Good Lock "can be used in all countries."</p><p>Good Lock is a popular choice for users of Samsung foldables. Specifically, the first-party launcher is the only official way to use any app on the cover screen of Galaxy Z Flip smartphones. This year's revision of Good Lock will include a few major changes that'll improve the UI of the launcher for not only foldables, but regular Samsung phones.</p><p>"The overall composition of the main app has been changed for UI convenience," the post explains. Samsung cites better search and filtering functionality, easier widget management, and added Good Lock functions as a few things that will debut alongside One UI 7.</p>

<p>For fans of Home Up, there's great news. The post calls Home Up "one of the most changed apps" this year, and it starts with letting users use Home Up on One UI Home without running the Home Up app.</p><p>Additionally, users will be able to place icons anywhere on the home screen without having to follow a strict grid. Other changes include gesture animation customization, folder customization, edge panel customization, and taskbar customization. This was previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-good-lock-module-customization-update-spotted">rumored following an October 2024 leak</a>.</p><p>Finally, the post reminds Good Lock fans that features well-received by enthusiasts could become standard One UI features in the future.</p><p>"Please use the Good Lock apps that show big and small changes and give us your opinions so that we can continue to develop them based on them," the post explains. "Features that receive good responses are continuously being absorbed into One UI features, so please continue to give us feedback in the future."</p><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">the One UI 7 beta is already available</a> for the Galaxy S24 series, the refreshed Good Lock app is still at least a few weeks away.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-announced">launched the Galaxy Fit 3</a> in most major regions early last year but left out the United States despite selling the Fit 2 there in 2020. At the time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-not-getting-us-launch">Samsung told us</a> that "market trends and needs for each region" explained why the Fit 3 would skip this territory.</p><p>Evidently, the economics have changed, as Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-a16-5g-galaxy-fit3-now-available-in-us/">announced</a> a U.S. Galaxy Fit 3 launch on January 9, for an affordable $59.99. Fans of the Galaxy Fit 2 who dislike how short-lived the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is have a new 13-day option, with a 1.6-inch AMOLED display that's 45% wider than the Fit 2's.</p><p>The affordable tracker has a water-resistant squircle design with a single button and touchscreen controls, without the touch bezel or circular look of most Galaxy Watches. It's much lighter, skinnier, and longer-lived than your typical Galaxy Watch, too, though this trade-off comes with limitations: It uses a battery-saving RTOS instead of Wear OS that can't handle apps or messaging.</p><p>Unlike the Galaxy Fit 2, the Galaxy Fit 3 doesn't appear to be compatible with iPhones, though we're following up with Samsung to confirm. Some features may also be Galaxy phone-specific, such as Find My Phone and remote camera controls.</p><p>The Galaxy Fit 3 also supports notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS, Samsung Health insights, and music playback controls from your nearby Android phone.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 has over 100 preset watch faces and just as many sports modes. Although it uses your phone's GPS for outdoor workouts, it'll still detect your heart rate, arm movements, and altitude for measuring stairs climbed.</p><p>When it comes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">best fitness trackers</a> in the U.S. today, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> is expensive and requires a subscription, while Xiaomi bands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xiaomis-next-gen-fitness-tracker-could-hit-stores-worldwide-soon">Smart Band 9</a> are inconsistently available and Amazfit hasn't sold a new band since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-band-7-review">Band 7</a> in 2022.</p><p>Even though smartwatches have become much more popular than cheap trackers, Samsung must see a market gap to target cheap wearable buyers who will trust the Samsung brand and appreciate the subscription-free health and fitness insights.</p><p>We're excited to test the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 for ourselves and see how its heart rate and sleep accuracy compare to those of a Galaxy Watch. As a launch promotion, Samsung is selling the Fit 3 for 50% off if you buy it with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Galaxy A16 5G</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Leaker reveals older Galaxy phones will be skipping the One UI 7 beta program.</li><li>These models include Galaxy S23, Galaxy S22, and Galaxy S21 series.</li><li>They might see the stable release directly in the first week of February.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has been releasing betas of its much-anticipated One UI 7 since the start of this month. While most of the latest Galaxy phones have received these betas, a new leak suggests that older models might not be able to get the Android 15-based OS betas.</p><p>According to tipster @FamilyTaes on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidpolice.com/samsung-may-skip-one-ui-7-beta-for-older-galaxy-phones/">Android Police</a>), the older Galaxy models, including the Galaxy S23, S22, and S21 series, won't get betas but rather stable builds in the first week of February 2025. The older models, according to the tipster, include the Galaxy A series as well.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">S24 series OneUI 7 beta 3 will release between 30th~6th (Can be +- 2 days).After beta 3 there'd be 2~3 more beta builds at max.S23/22/21/A series won't have any beta program.Stable rollout schedule will be announced at unpacked, 22nd Jan (most probably Feb 1st~2nd week).<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1871635939304542366">December 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>On the other hand, the tipster further shared details about the One UI 7 beta 3, which is likely to be released by January 6. The release will be followed by two or three more beta builds before the Unpacked event, which is rumored to take place on January 22, in the U.S. and in tandem with the company's home country, South Korea.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Ultra models were the first handsets to receive the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">first week</a> of December. The enrolled beta testers of the aforementioned devices later received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second beta</a> in the U.S. region in the third week of the same month.</p>
<p>While the new operating system has many new features, one of the highlights is the 'Now Bar,' which came with the first version of One UI 7.

<ul><li>Currently, you can sync dismissed notification statuses between Pixel devices, but there's a catch.</li><li>Syncing only works between Pixel phones and tablets when you're connected to Wi-Fi.</li><li>In a future update, Google could add a toggle that enables cellular data use for notification syncing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is building a multi-device ecosystem with the Pixel brand, and there were a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> tweaks that made the experience of using multiple Pixel phones and tablets better. One such feature automatically dismisses notifications from all your Pixel devices if you dismiss on either your Pixel phone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and it's quite handy. However, it only works over Wi-Fi, which isn't very helpful if you're dismissing notifications on your smartphone when you're out and about.</p><p>The company is seemingly aware of this limitation and is testing an option to use cellular data to sync notifications, according to code strings spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-notification-dismissal-sync-3511975/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The strings were spotted in <strong>version 1.0.687093228_arm64-v8a_release_phone</strong> of the Device Connectivity Service app. This is a Pixel-specific app that handles cross device services between Pixel phones behind the scenes. In it, there's evidence that Google might one day let you use cellular data for notification syncing.</p><p>The toggle is simply described as letting users "use mobile network to sync when no Wi-Fi is connected." It's not visible publicly, but the functionality could be added in a future software update.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1056px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:107.77%;"><img id="RMSHCKwW76jiph4Z2FQpU9" name="Dismiss-Notifications-Pixel" alt="The new toggle for dismiss notifications across Pixel devices." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMSHCKwW76jiph4Z2FQpU9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1056" height="1138" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To date, notification syncing for Pixel devices has been limited to Wi-Fi connections only. "Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices syncs when each device is connected to Wi-Fi," the fine print explains. This is likely to preserve battery life and cellular data usage. A toggle giving users the option to enable cellular use would be ideal for people who are willing to sacrifice the battery life hit or have unlimited data plans.</p><p>Although the <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong> is exclusive to Pixel phones and tablets, Google is also working on more general Cross Device Services that bridge the gap between other Android brands. More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/androids-cross-device-services-just-became-available-for-another-brand">Cross Device Services came to Nothing phones</a>.</p><p>For now, Pixel users will need to continue waiting for Wi-Fi to sync their dismissed notifications between their Pixel phones and tablets. However, this new development provides some hope that one day there might be a cellular option.</p>

Fortunately, Samsung has decided to lessen the blow by offering up to $1,200 off when you process a trade in. If you don't have an old device to get rid of, skip the trade-in altogether and you'll still get $300 off. </p>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a sophisticated foldable phone with great performance, long software support, and AI features; you have an old device to trade in. </p>
<p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the best cameras and battery life; you can get a better deal through your wireless carrier. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is easily one of the best foldable phones ever built, with two outstanding AMOLED displays, a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, and the latest Galaxy AI software features. As with Samsung&apos;s S24 flagship series, you&apos;re also guaranteed to receive seven years of OS and security updates. </p><p>Now, to be honest, I can&apos;t recommend spending nearly two grand on a smartphone, even if it is foldable and high-tech. But if you can manage to score some sweet trade-in credit with this deal, it&apos;s seriously worth checking out. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25"><em><strong>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is coming: here's everything we know so far</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>Only recent devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 5 will earn you the full $1,200 trade-in discount, but phones dating back to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will land you an excellent $1,000 off. I even plugged in my beat-up Galaxy S9, just for fun, and was shocked to see that I was eligible to receive $500 off. Dig up your old phones and use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakaxaa/"><strong>Samsung&apos;s trade-in tool</strong></a> if you&apos;d like to see how much you can earn with this offer.</p><p>In addition to the trade-in savings, Samsung is offering up to 30% off accessories like the Galaxy Watch 7 when you order it alongside the Z Fold 6. You&apos;ll also get three months of YouTube Premium, three months of Peacock Premium, and two months of Adobe Lightroom for free. It&apos;s one of those deals that just keeps getting better and better, so check it out before it&apos;s gone.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G and Galaxy Fit 3 are coming to the U.S. next week, priced at $199.99 and $59.99, respectively.</li><li>Samsung is offering six generations of full OS upgrades on the Galaxy A16 5G, a first for a product at this price point.</li><li>The Galaxy A16 5G also includes a new Exynos processor, an IP rating, and a larger screen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is bringing two popular budget devices, the Samsung Galaxy A16 5G and the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3, to the U.S. next week, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-a16-5g-galaxy-fit3-now-available-in-us/" target="_blank">press release</a> today. Both the budget smartphone and fitness tracker will be available starting Jan. 9, 2025 at retailers nationwide. As the successor to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15 5G</a>, the new Galaxy A16 5G provides a longer software support window and more durability at the same price point.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a16-5g-six-year-promise-launch">Samsung Galaxy A16 5G</a> builds off the improvements made with the Galaxy A15 5G, which was the first to add an OLED screen. This time around, the 6.7″ FHD+ Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy A16 5G is larger, still offering a 90Hz refresh rate and 800 nits of peak brightness. The design of the handset is similar, too, but there are some hidden changes to this year's budget smartphone.</p><p>Notably, Samsung is switching from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-6100-plus-launch">Mediatek Dimensity 6100+ chipset</a> to its own Exynos 1330 system-on-a-chip. That may be why Samsung is able to offer best-in-class software support for a $199 smartphone with the Galaxy A16 5G. You'll get six generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades. The smartphone starts with One UI 6, which is based on Android 14. Even if one of those six-generations promised cancels out since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is already here, it's still remarkable — and Samsung gives six years of security updates, too.</p>

<p>The company also managed to make the Galaxy A16 5G more durable, as it's now rated for IP54 protection against dust and water ingress. That won't provide the same level of protection as IP68 and IP69 flagships, but it is impressive for a smartphone at this price point.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy A16 5G ships with a 5,000mAh battery and 25W fast charging support. As for cameras, there's a 50MP main sensor, 5MP ultrawide, and 2MP macro lens on the rear.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G will cost $199.99, and the Galaxy Fit 3 will cost $59.99. When the two devices become available for purchase next Thursday, Jan. 9, buyers can save 50% off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-announced">Galaxy Fit 3</a> when they buy a Galaxy A16 5G from Samsung's online store.</p>

<p>It has also shared the steps on how to use the Circle to Search on the respective phones. The conventional methods include long pressing on the home button if users prefer the three navigation buttons on their devices. Users who opt for gestures can long press the navigation bar to trigger the Circle to Search feature. Enabling the feature on the said Nothing phones is relatively simple.</p><p>Users need to navigate to the device's <strong>Settings > Special features > Gestures > Navigation mode > Circle to Search</strong>. Also, if you own either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a>, you would want to make sure that you are running Nothing OS 3.0 and with the following build numbers:</p>
<ul><li>Phone (2): <strong>Pong-V3.0-241207-0124</strong></li><li>Phone (2a): <strong>Pacman-V3.0-241210-2057</strong></li><li>Phone (2a) Plus: <strong>PacmanPro-V3.0-241126-1448 (Beta build)</strong></li></ul>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xGuYeKMnPUi7hn9AvEsw7U" name="thinborne-galaxy-z-fold-5-iphone-15-pro-max.jpg" alt="Thinborne case for Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGuYeKMnPUi7hn9AvEsw7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Namerah Saud Fatmi: </strong>Believe it or not, the phone case market is pretty cutthroat. There are literally thousands of brands out there, so it's really hard to single out the diamond in the rough. Thinborne consistently delivers impossibly slim phone covers made of sturdy aramid fiber, winning it the title of the best phone case brand in 2024.</p><p>"Borne" out of Texas, each accessory from this all-American brand is made with love by a surprisingly small team dedicated to creating the thinnest phone case in the world. Most slim cases sacrifice durability, but not the ones from Thinborne. What’s even more impressive is that the brand’s latest creations come with MagSafe baked in!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wireless-headphones-sonos-ace"><span>Best wireless headphones: Sonos Ace</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP" name="Sonos-Ace-in-hand.jpg" alt="Carrying Sonos Ace headphones from headband." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Tshaka Armstrong: </strong>There were some notable firsts for wireless headphones in 2024. Chief among them, and the one many consumers probably didn’t see coming, was Sonos’ first pair of wireless over-ear headphones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a>. Imagine it: headphones that tie into one of the best home theater ecosystems, and they may actually sound more personal and immersive than your home theater setup.</p><p>That’s just the beginning. With built-in WiFi, the Ace can receive audio handed off from Sonos’ soundbars, with Dolby Atmos support, and they’re also a highly capable pair of Bluetooth headphones, supporting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">hi-res wireless audio codecs</a>. You also get impressive active noise canceling that rivals industry leaders Sony and Bose. You can also listen to lossless audio files via a wired connection if you choose.</p><p>Being first-gen, though, they aren’t without some growing pains. For instance, the headphones can’t connect to all of the speakers in Sonos’ lineup, and their connection is only one way, so no transferring music from your phone/headphones to your Sonos speakers.</p><p>Despite any first-gen shortcomings, the team here at Android Central thinks the Sonos Ace are the best wireless headphones of 2024. With the Ace on the market, Sony and Bose’s lack of innovation in this area becomes a glaring omission. Maybe that will change in 2025</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wireless-earbuds-google-pixel-buds-pro-2"><span>Best wireless earbuds: Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="w8GaRqHxCyTEQB4fyeeaLG" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-color-array-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 array of colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8GaRqHxCyTEQB4fyeeaLG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Tshaka Armstrong: </strong>It was an excellent year for Bluetooth earbuds! Whether it was artificial intelligence taking center stage, hi-resolution wireless audio support, or booming bass from open-ear designs, there was something for everyone.</p><p>With regard to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, that “something for everyone” was best exemplified in Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. This iteration of their Buds Pro line was redesigned to fit more people’s ears, which is huge. What isn’t huge is their size. Powered by their in-house Tensor A1 chip, Google managed to make them more comfortable, fit more tech, more battery life, and an acoustic redesign into a smaller package, and that is part of what makes them Android Central’s pick for best wireless earbuds of 2024.</p><p>A huge factor in earning that designation is that the only major feature you lose by not having the Pixel Buds Pro 2 connected to a Pixel phone is Spatial Audio with head tracking. That ensures these buds have a bit of something for everyone, no matter who makes your favorite phone.</p><p>Three of my favorite aspects of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are:</p>
<ul><li>Impressive spatial audio quality, as I listened to Blue Eye Samurai on Netflix which supports spatial audio for movies.</li><li>From sound quality customization via EQ, to real-time hearing wellness monitoring, the Pixel Buds app elevates the Pixel Buds Pro 2 experience.</li><li>Native Google Gemini support. It’s in its infancy and as a result definitely has some growing pains but Gemini Live integration with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 was engaging, even if a bit rough around the edges.</li></ul>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-streaming-device-google-tv-streamer"><span>Best streaming device: Google TV Streamer</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zG58uwCatbYwnLZsweERoa" name="google-tv-streamer-review-22.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Android figure and remote" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zG58uwCatbYwnLZsweERoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> Most TV streaming boxes aren't worth the bother, but thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> is a worthy successor to the mighty Chromecast. The streaming box has an interesting design, plenty of power, and all the codecs you need — it has no issues with HDR videos on YouTube. There's no jitter when navigating the interface; it runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> and lets you install all your streaming services via the Play Store, and it has no trouble streaming high-bitrate content.</p><p>In short, it is a terrific streaming solution, and you're getting a good value as these things go.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> NVIDIA Shield TV Pro</p><p>I still prefer the second-place pick, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">NVIDIA's Shield TV Pro</a>. It has been around for over five years, but it still has the best overall hardware, and it continues to get regular updates. If you need extras like the ability to connect an external drive or stream games via a service like Moonlight, the Shield TV Pro is still my pick. But if you just need a reliable media streaming solution, the Google TV Streamer can't be beat right now.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-home-device-nest-learning-thermostat-4th-gen"><span>Best smart home device: Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen)</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb" name="google-nest-learning-thermostat-gen-4-06.jpg" alt="The shiny Google Nest Learning Thermostat (Gen 4)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick: </strong>With 2024 coming to an end, there's still a feeling that bigger things are on the horizon for smart home devices. That being said, Google's release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-google-pixel-watch-models-should-steal-this-nest-learning-thermostat-design-feature">Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen)</a> was a long time coming. The previous iteration was released back in 2018, and while the 3rd Gen is still an excellent option, it was definitely time for an upgrade.</p><p>Google managed to deliver exactly that with the 4th Gen, essentially putting an enlarged Pixel Watch in control of the comfort at home. Along with the larger display and slimmer bezels, the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) also brings Matter support to the table, something that is becoming increasingly important.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Tapo 2K Indoor Security Camera</p><p>Speaking of Matter, Tapo is one brand that has been making waves, so much so that its lineup of smart security cameras made our list. Do you need a cheap camera to keep an eye on your puppy while you're out and about? The Tapo 2K Indoor Security Camera is just $30. Are you tired of needing to figure out how to open the door for someone while you're in the middle of doing housework? Snag the Tapo Smart Battery Video Doorbell for $80.</p><p>Tapo falls under the TP-Link umbrella but has been growing in popularity for a variety of reasons. Currently, there are 17 different listings on the Tapo storefront, which is already impressive, and Tapo offers a fantastic smart home security ecosystem on a budget, including this fantastic security camera.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Code found in the latest Google app beta hints at free access to Gemini Advanced for Galaxy S25 buyers.</li><li>Free access could vary by model: the base S25 might get 3 months, the S25 Plus could have 6 months, and the S25 Ultra may score a full year.</li><li>The code also hints at a broader plan, with a Motorola device possibly getting in on the Gemini Advanced action.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's next-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, set to drop this month, promises a hefty dose of AI features, building on last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. But Samsung might up the ante with free access to Google’s Gemini Advanced AI models.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-free-gemini-advanced-3511917/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug up some juicy details in the beta version 15.52.37 of the Google app, hinting at a big Google-Samsung team-up. Buried in the code are four lines pointing to free access to Gemini Advanced.</p><p>The strings mention access periods from one month to a full year, likely depending on which Galaxy S25 model you purchase.</p><p>How long you get free access depends on your Galaxy S25 pick. Presumably, higher-end models are expected to get longer trial periods. This means that the base model might offer a three-month trial, the S25 Plus could bump it to 6 months, and the S25 Ultra is rumored to score a full year of free access to this AI service.</p><p>This tempting offer could definitely push buyers to grab an S25 once it arrives.</p><p>Looking closer at the code, it hints at a bigger plan. While the Galaxy S25 series is in the spotlight, there’s also mention of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> and an unnamed Motorola device, plus the chance that other devices could join in, making Gemini Advanced more accessible across the Android ecosystem.</p><p>Giving devices access to Gemini Advanced isn’t new. Last year, Google’s Pixel 9 Pro models came with a free one-year subscription to this advanced AI service.</p><p>What sets Gemini Advanced apart is the AI it uses. It taps into Google’s most advanced models, going way beyond the standard Samsung Galaxy AI. This means it’s better at handling complex tasks like coding, logical reasoning, understanding multi-modal inputs, and even teaming up on creative projects.</p><p>Gemini Advanced also speeds up image generation compared to the free version. Plus, it works smoothly with core Google services like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and more.</p><p>It’s a cool bonus, if it pans out, especially with all the power Gemini Advanced packs. While Google has released a few versions of Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">only Advanced users get the latest models</a>, like 2.0 Flash and 1.5 Deep Research, which just started rolling out this month.</p>

<ul><li>An early Geekbench 6 result appeared for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ahead of its release.</li><li>While the scores are lower than other Snapdragon 8 Elite handsets, the system information report reveals Samsung may be overclocking its chip.</li><li>Two of the Snapdragon 8 Elite's eight CPU cores appear to be overclocked, potentially for a Snapdragon 8 Elite "for Galaxy" branded chip.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 series is widely expected to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. However, it has been unclear whether Samsung will use an overclocked version of the processor, much like the "for Galaxy" versions of Snapdragon chips in previous Galaxy phones. There's now a good chance that we'll see a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/9695154" target="_blank">prerelease Geekbench 6 scores</a>.</p><p>The benchmark scores showed up for the international model of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in the Geekbench 6 database, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s25_international_model_specs_geekbench-news-65919.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>. The scores themselves aren't that impressive — the benchmark results below are lower than what we've tested with other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review#section-asus-rog-phone-9-pro-performance">Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro</a> — but the clock speeds of the chip are higher.</p><p>According to the system information report on the Geekbench 6 results page, two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> cores are clocked at 4.47 GHz, which is slightly higher than the default 4.32 GHz speed. Meanwhile, the six-core cluster remains at the usual 3.53 GHz speed. This suggests that Samsung will ship an overclocked version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip on the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:137.12%;"><img id="kG8J2ESeaN5vsorro83fXW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Geekbench-6" alt="The Geekbench 6 scores for the Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kG8J2ESeaN5vsorro83fXW.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="862" height="1182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Geekbench)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the performance dip, that is all but certainly attributed to the fact that these benchmarks were recorded on pre-release hardware and software. It's likely that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's final benchmark scores will end up higher than these early figures. Another factor to consider is that the Galaxy S25 Ultra tested was a unit with 12GB of RAM, and Samsung could offer a 16GB version with faster performance.</p><p>Though this benchmark leak does suggest Samsung is working on overclocking the Snapdragon 8 Elite for its next flagships, it isn't a guarantee. This could simply be a test to see whether an overclocked version meets Samsung's quality standards. However, this late in the release cycle — the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to debut this month — it's likely that this benchmark overclock is indicative of the company's plans.</p><p>Regardless of whether Samsung overclocks the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's significantly faster than the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Additionally, prior rumors predict that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">will power the Galaxy S25 series in all markets</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 13R is less than a week away from an official reveal, and we're now learning more about exactly what specifications the midrange smartphone will have. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is a known quantity due to its China release, the OnePlus 13R has a bit more mystery. It's loosely based on the OnePlus Ace 5, but has plenty of unique tweaks. According to the latest leaks and rumors, the OnePlus 13R will get a significant camera upgrade over the Ace 5 and its predecessor, the OnePlus 12R.</p><p>Leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1873981828920426500" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a> shared rumored camera specs for the OnePlus 13R. The main camera is a 50MP Sony LYT-700 lens with a 1/1.56-inch sensor size and a stacked CMOS image sensor. That's paired with an 8MP ultrawide camera that appears to be the same sensor used on last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. Finally, the third camera sensor is a 50MP Samsung JN5 lens capable of 2x optical zoom.</p><p>Samsung's JN5 sensor may not be a telephoto lens like the ones we've become accustomed to, and it only achieves 2x optical zoom. However, it's a lens that has become commonplace across mobile devices due to its many uses.</p><p>"The JN5’s slim optical format makes it highly versatile, allowing it to be used across main and sub cameras — including wide-angle, ultra-wide-angle, front and telephoto — promising a consistent camera experience from various angles," Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-unveils-versatile-image-sensors-for-superior-smartphone-photography" target="_blank">explains</a>.</p>

<p>If this rumor pans out, the 50MP Samsung JN5 sensor will replace the 2MP macro lens on the OnePlus 12R. This would be a long-overdue move that'll result in improved camera performance for OnePlus 13R users. Typically, small macro lenses are rarely used and don't always provide performance better than applying a macro effect to the main sensor. Put simply, the JN5 telephoto will be far more appreciated by OnePlus 13R users than the 2MP macro lens was on the OnePlus 12R.</p><p>Additionally, Brar reveals that the OnePlus 13R's selfie camera will be a 16MP lens. That's the same as the OnePlus 12R, and it's likely that the selfie camera will be unchanged as a result.</p><p>Ahead of the OnePlus 13R's official launch, we now know quite a bit about the device. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-massive-leak-seemingly-reveals-official-oneplus-13r-renders-and-colors">Leaked renders revealed the two colorways</a> for the smartphone, including every angle of the phone. We also know it'll be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset</a>, just like the OnePlus Ace 5, thanks to a leaked Amazon listing. On top of that, OnePlus confirmed this phone will have a thin form factor and a 6,000mAh battery capacity.</p><p>To learn more about the OnePlus 13R, you can watch<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13r-is-a-thin-midranger-with-a-6-000mah-battery-arriving-january-7"> the Jan. 7, 2025 launch event</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>After mixed reports chronicled whether Samsung would ever make a cheaper foldable, it looks like a midrange or budget "Galaxy Z Flip FE" is in the works. Earlier this week, a GSMA database entry confirmed the existence of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip FE. Now, a renowned display analyst has predicted the panel that the Galaxy Z Flip FE will use, and it's good news for potential buyers interested in the foldable.</p><p>Ross Young, a display analyst and the CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), says that the Galaxy Z Flip FE will use the exact same display panel as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. That means the inner screen probably won't be one of the areas Samsung compromises on to cut the sticker price of its upcoming budget foldable. Additionally, it'll put a bit of pressure on Samsung to make sure the Galaxy Z Flip 7's screen is better than the one used in the Galaxy Z Flip FE.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Z Flip 6 panel.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873886050399269268">December 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For reference, the display in the current Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a foldable Dynamic LTPO AMOLED screen. It has a 1080 x 2640 resolution, features a 120Hz refresh rate, and offers HDR10+ and 2,600 nits of peak brightness. With fairly thin bezels and a hole-punch camera cutout, it's one of the best clamshell foldable screens available to date.</p>

Now, an analyst with a rock-solid track record thinks the Galaxy Z Flip FE will feature the same screen as the current Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>There are still many questions that remain, like exactly how cheap the Galaxy Z Flip FE will be. We'll also be watching the Galaxy Z Flip 7 to see what improvements Samsung makes to differentiate these two foldables.</p>

I have tried YouTube Music and Apple Music, but frankly, neither of them really meets my needs as well as Spotify does. The app this year also has one of my favourite end-of-year features "Spotify Unwrapped" and this year it integrated a lot of AI to give me more information on my listening habits! <br><br>I will say that while Netflix is the king of streaming services there are many others out there with great shows. But of course, there can only be one winner and we picked Netflix! There are a lot of great shows and it's highly entertaining, not to mention that the streaming giant is also getting into the world of live TV, which we suspect will expand over the next year. <br><br>Finally, we couldn't finish this list without talking about the best Android app: Gemini. Google outdid itself with a truly remarkable app and it's one the AC Staff has been very excited about using. <br><br>Congrats to all the winners! <br><br>Of course, here's what some of my colleagues, Derrek Lee, Patrick Farmer, and Namerah Saud-Fatmi have to say about the winners,</p>

<p><strong>Derrek Lee: </strong>We just can’t quit you, can we? Spotify continues to be not only our favorite music streaming service but, apparently, everyone else’s too. Just in November, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-11-12/spotify-reports-third-quarter-2024-earnings/">reported</a> that it has 252 million subscribers, up 12% from the previous year. It also has more than 640 million monthly active users, which is up 11% from last year. So why do we love Spotify so much?</p><p>The streamlined UI just makes it impressively easy to listen to the music you love and discover new tracks. And while Spotify has yet to introduce its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio"> long-awaited Hi-Fi tier</a>, the company continues to add and test new features to stay ahead of the game, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">personalized AI-generated playlists</a> that let you tell it what you want to listen to. It also added a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-new-basic-plan-for-the-us"> cheaper base plan</a> for users who don’t need access to audiobooks.</p><p>It was a pretty good year for Spotify, but we hope 2025 will be a great year for audiophiles who await higher-quality listening. With any luck, we’ll finally get that “Super Premium” plan we’ve been hearing about.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> YouTube Music</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> is our runner-up as Google continues to make its streaming app more competitive. This year, the company has made a few tweaks to the UI and added a number of AI features to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-is-testing-letting-you-build-custom-radio-stations-using-ai-prompts">help you create playlists</a> and thumbnails. It hasn’t been too exciting of a year for YouTube Music, but it’s steadily becoming a worthy Spotify competitor for anyone looking. Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-premium-100-million-subscriber-celebration">Google celebrated 100 million subscribers</a>, so something must be working.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick Farmer: </strong>Despite a controversial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-q2-2023-earnings-report">password-sharing crackdown</a> and another round of predicted price increases on the horizon (according to analysts), 2024 was a great year for Netflix. From blockbuster films to original series and holiday romcoms — did anyone else watch “The Merry Gentlemen”? Just me? All right, moving on — Netflix has content for just about every type of user.</p><p>This year may not have seen Netflix dropping any groundbreaking cultural phenomena like “Squid Game” or “Stranger Things,” but it has continued to hold the line as the world’s most popular streaming service. And with its recent foray into the world of gaming, it’s clear that Netflix has no intention of resting on its laurels any time soon.</p>

<p><strong>Namerah Saud-Fatmi: </strong>Apps are available a dime a dozen, but it takes an infinite amount of effort and beyond to make the best one. Google had all the right resources for the job and put them to work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>. This language model married the smarts of Google Assistant to concoct the ultimate Android app.</p><p>With Gemini, anything is possible. Need to create automations for your smart home? No problem. Have some code that needs help getting written? Done deal. There's very little this AI can't handle, be it image generation or pulling from all your Google services like Gmail to answer prompts.</p>

<hr>
<p>LineageOS, an Android custom ROM project that aims to support both new and old smartphones, is already adding support for Android 15. The team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Dec. 31, that LineageOS 22.1 is rolling out based on the latest Android 15 QPR1.  It was able to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to LineageOS quicker than expected due to the breakthroughs made adapting Android 12 through Android 14, according to the blog post.</p><p>"This is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a device perspective we have seen in years," wrote Nolen Johnson, the developer relations manager for LineageOS, in the blog post. "This means that many more devices are ready on day one that we’d typically expect to have up this early in the cycle."</p><p>Aside from the system improvements brought by Android 15, LineageOS 22.1 includes a few new features and additions. For starters, security patches as recent as November 2024 have been merged to LineageOS 19.1 through 22.1. There are also two new apps: Twelve and Camelot.</p><p>Twelve is a brand-new music player that replaces the prior music player, Eleven. As one of the oldest LineageOS apps, the team explained that it was time for a replacement. Eleven was becoming noncompliant with new Android guidelines due to its older codebase, and Twelve is an improved replacement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.33%;"><img id="cGpcrv7K3ZMuPHWsZuNcJU" name="Twelve-Lineage-OS" alt="The new music app included in LineageOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGpcrv7K3ZMuPHWsZuNcJU.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7200" height="3120" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: LineageOS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the new app's highlights include Material You design language and support for tablets and landscape mode. It'll integrate with major music server protocols, like Subsonic, OpenSubsonic, and Jellyfin. On top of that, there's better search, improved Android Auto support, and new support for streaming protocols — such as HLS, DASH, and SmoothStreaming.</p><p>Camelot is a basic PDF viewer that aims to fill the gap left by LineageOS' Jelly and WebViews, which can't open PDF files. It's described as a simple app based on Google Chrome and Files by Google releases.</p><p>LineageOS will use a decimal integer system moving forward to match Android's quarterly platform releases (QPRs). LineageOS 22.1 is based on Android 15 QPR1, and a future Android 15 QPR2 update would eventually lead to LineageOS 22.2.</p><p>Of course, LineageOS is best known for supporting older devices, and support is excellent out of the gate. You can find more information on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/" target="_blank">LineageOS Wiki</a>, but over 100 devices are eligible for the latest upgrade on day one. That includes older devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2-review">Google Pixel 2</a>, and newer ones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>.</p>

<ul><li>New features found within the OHealth app preview fitness and health tools that could come to the OnePlus Watch 3.</li><li>The app includes ECG support, wrist temperature detection, a 60-second checkup mode, and more.</li><li>Separately, code strings reveal that OnePlus may be releasing two OnePlus Watch 3 variants: a OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> offered the best battery life of any Wear OS watch while hitting an affordable price point, it fell short in a few areas. Notably, the OnePlus Watch 2's fitness and health monitoring was lacking. OnePlus might be flipping the script with the OnePlus Watch 3, adding an expansive suite of fitness and health features that could make it competitive with some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> around.</p><p>For starters, we should point out that these new features could be coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/major-oneplus-watch-3-specs-leak">OnePlus Watch 3</a> <em>series</em>. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-pro-3512051/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, code strings in the OHealth app include mentions of not only a OnePlus Watch 3, but also a OnePlus Watch 3 Pro. On top of that, a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-ohealth-features-apk-teardown-3512061/" target="_blank">report</a> details a handful of new health features found in <strong>version 4.30.11_e27d199_241122</strong> of the OHealth app.</p><p>Notably, the app appears to support features that aren't possible with current OnePlus Watch hardware. The biggest new functionality is electrocardiogram (ECG) support, which was absent on the OnePlus Watch 2 but could come to the OnePlus Watch 3 series. You'll be able to start an ECG reading from your smartphone (providing it meets OnePlus' system requirements), and get access to health insights based on the results.</p><p>For example, an ECG reading could result in any number of determinations, including sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, frequent PVCs, frequent PACs, high or low heart rate, or an inconclusive reading. Not all of these results are bad (sinus rhythm is simply the term for the regular electrical impulses of a heart pumping) but all of them can be insightful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1625px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.55%;"><img id="svVSTf8aNtaStwTBs7SSjM" name="IMG_0541" alt="Screenshots of the Ohealth app from an APK teardown from Android Authority." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/svVSTf8aNtaStwTBs7SSjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1625" height="919" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new capability found in the OHealth app is wrist temperature detection. Like other smartwatches that offer the feature, you'll need to wear your OnePlus Watch to sleep for five days to get a baseline temperature. From there, you'll be able to view whether your wrist temperature is normal, above baseline, or below baseline.</p><p>Since the OnePlus Watch 2 lacks a temperature sensor, this once again looks like an upcoming OnePlus Watch 3 and Watch 3 Pro feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 activity data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of these features are just OnePlus catching up to the competition, but others are brand new — like the 60-second checkup mode uncovered in the OHealth app. It'll run a quick check of seven health indicators to look for signs of a few major health risks: heart health, blood vessel elasticity, and sleep snoring.</p><p>To house all of these features, the OHealth app is gaining a dedicated Health tab for these data points. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-wishlist">With how underwhelming the OnePlus Watch 2 was</a> in terms of health and fitness capabilities, it's a good sign that the OHealth app seems to be getting prepped for a slew of new offerings.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims to have discovered several model numbers concerning the future of Samsung's foldables in the One UI 7 beta.</li><li>From the list, it seems Samsung is crafting the next Flip 7 and Fold 7, as well as another Fold Special Edition.</li><li>The rumored "Flip FE" was notably missing; however, a recent database discovery detailed its model number.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Samsung pushing ahead with its One UI 7 beta, its code might hold clues about the company's overall foldable plans.</p><p>A teardown of the beta thus far by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-special-edition-model-numbers-3511581/">Android Authority</a>) reportedly contains a list of model numbers. According to the tipster, the list of internal names suggests the future of Samsung's foldables, beginning with the book-style device, the Galaxy Z Fold. The post states the beta offers model number SM-F968, which is supposedly a "successor" to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>.</p><p>Speaking of new foldables, the publication states that it did not find signs of a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-rumors-rekindled-next-year">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a>." This clamshell has been rumored for a few months now; however, the tipster states the latest software beta didn't contain its would-be model number.</p><p>What the beta does contain are the apparent model numbers for Samsung's next wave of Galaxy Z Flip and Fold devices. Allegedly, the upcoming wave of phones feature model numbers SM-F751 and SM-F966, respectively. The post is relatively confident that these concern the next-gen foldables, considering the model numbers have jumped "by 10," which is "tradition with Samsung."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-28.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a wireless charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The One UI 7 beta curiously lacks the rumored Flip FE model number, but a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-working-on-a-cheap-galaxy-z-flip-and-a-surprise-for-the-watch-8">GSMA database discovery</a> holds more for us. The device's internal number — SM-F761B — was discovered recently and believed to be the highly anticipated Galaxy Z Flip FE. This device is expected to arrive as a cheaper alternative to the standard flagship clamshell model in 2025.</p><p>More importantly, a rumor from November claimed the device <em>could </em>launch alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7, likely in the middle of 2025. Additionally, the phone could debut with Samsung's in-house Exynos 2400e chipset. This is the same chip that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> sports.</p><p>This isn't the only Samsung foldable news to surface as, last week, a report claimed the company was interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">slashing its 2025 shipments</a>. Compared to the Flip 5/Fold 5, Samsung's Flip 6/Fold 6 was underwhelming and underperformed. It's been rumored that the Korean OEM could set aside roughly 5 million foldable units next year with the Flip 7 making up ~3 million of them.</p><p>For context, the company's Flip 5 and Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">shattered records</a> with a whopping 1.02 million pre-orders in South Korea. Fast forward to 2024 and those numbers dropped to 910,000.</p><p>Elsewhere, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second One UI 7 beta</a> kicked off before Christmas for the S24 series. It brought a wealth of error and malfunction fixes while others await its stable launch. The software, based on Android 15, is expected to arrive alongside or near the launch of the Galaxy S25 series in January.</p>

<ul><li>Vivo’s mixed-reality team has supposedly reached over 500 members and the company is going all-in on a new headset.</li><li>At an event Dec. 31, the company revealed plans to prototype a mixed-realty headset with features that could surpass Apple Vision Pro.</li><li>The headset is said to deliver “high-fidelity prototype experiences” in a few cities in late 2025, but there’s no word on when a Vivo headset would be available for purchase.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The race to build the best mixed-reality headsets is heating up, and we’re starting to see just as many cryptic, unreleased prototypes as widely-available products. The market will gain one more prototype in 2025, as Vivo announced plans to reveal a mixed-reality headset late next year at an event Dec. 31, 2024. Vivo has lofty goals for the headset, and wants to dethrone Apple Vision Pro in a few areas, according to information relayed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5117293942543312" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_will_unveil_a_mixed_reality_headset_next_year-news-65904.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Aside from a generic teaser image, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo</a> didn’t share any details about its future headset. An unveiling is slated for next fall, sometime in September and October. At this stage, Vivo’s mixed-reality headset will almost certainly be a prototype. In fact, Vivo says that it expects to offer “high-fidelity prototype experiences" with its headset in select Chinese cities by the end of 2025.</p><p>Of course, aside from a confident pledge that Vivo’s mixed-reality headset will top <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a>, Vivo doesn’t have anything to share about how it will achieve that goal. Vision Pro, while considered a commercial failure by Apple’s usual standards, is still lauded for its impressive hardware and feature set. That’s likely why Vivo is targeting Vision Pro, especially in its home country of China.</p><p>It is worth noting that Vision Pro, released in February 2024, will be well over a year old when Vivo supposedly plans to best it with its own mixed-reality headset at the tail end of 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dNhxa3KRfjRfNt5ZJdBeb3" name="Apple-Vision-Pro-Viva-Tech-demo.jpg" alt="Using the Apple Vision Pro at Viva Tech 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNhxa3KRfjRfNt5ZJdBeb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Vivo wants to outdo Apple Vision Pro, the headset worn in the photo above.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the company gave us a general idea of when a prototype Vivo headset will be revealed, there’s no word yet on pricing or general availability. It isn’t the only company to tease a mixed-reality product you can’t buy yet — and likely won’t be able to for a long time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta teased Orion earlier this year</a>, a pair of MR glasses too expensive to mass produce. More recently, Samsung showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, which will be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR</a> headset to debut next year.</p><p>Being that so little is known about the Vivo headset, it’s probably best to approach it with a bit of skepticism. Pricing and availability have been huge barriers to mixed-reality tech to date. Meta’s Quest headsets are affordable but not necessarily top-tier, while Apple Vision Pro has great hardware and costs a fortune. It’s unclear where Vivo will fall, or if it’ll be somewhere in the middle.</p>

<hr>
<p>Ahead of the OnePlus 13R's official launch, set for Jan. 7, 2025, a massive leak revealed renders showing every angle of the upcoming midranger. The images were shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin" target="_blank">Arsène Lupin on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and show off what appear to be the only two OnePlus 13R colorways (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_13r_leaked_renders_show_both_colorways_in_detail-news-65905.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). While the official names of each color option aren't known, they look like versions of silver and space gray.</p><p>OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 13R for a few weeks now, and revealed some information about the device. However, we don't know as much about the OnePlus 13R as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which is already available in China. Instead, the OnePlus 13R is likely to be a global rendition of the OnePlus Ace 5. With that being said, some already-known differences — like the smaller battery capacity — prove that the OnePlus 13R isn't a perfect rebrand of the Ace 5.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">13R pic.twitter.com/Svo524o8at<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873695192198664574">December 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Previously, OnePlus only shared a cryptic, zoomed image of the OnePlus 13R's camera bump and rear chassis. This is the first time we've seen a complete look of the OnePlus 13R, if these leaked renders are indeed accurate. It represents a significant design change for OnePlus' midrange phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> had a slim, curved design language that has been ditched for a boxy and rectangular look.</p><p>The display and back panel both appear to be flat, marking a long-overdue shift from OnePlus' curved screens. The entire smartphone market is moving in this direction, with Samsung, Google, and Apple, all releasing phones with a rectangular chassis.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/BYWFhUc1gS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873695720462795156">December 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Otherwise, the OnePlus 13R looks like it'll keep a few OnePlus staples — as expected. For starters, there's the circular camera bump and the etched OnePlus logo on the back. You also get the OnePlus alert slider and a physical SIM card tray.</p><p>Beyond these leaks, OnePlus has already confirmed that the OnePlus 13R will feature a thin form factor and a 6,000mAh battery capacity. Additionally, an early Amazon listing revealed it'll be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset</a>. To learn more about the OnePlus 13R, you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13r-is-a-thin-midranger-with-a-6-000mah-battery-arriving-january-7">tune into the Jan. 7, 2025 launch event</a>.</p>

I particularly found it interesting that during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there were many people who were clicking on our deals for a Chromebook. Perhaps it really was an upgrade year! <br><br>That being said, Samsung outperformed everyone with a double whammy, releasing the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra. Samsung took both slots as Best Chromebook and Tablet of the Year and we congratulate you wholeheartedly!!</p><p>But you don't have to hear from me, I think it goes without saying that our resident Chromebook and Tablet expert Andrew Myrick says it all, here's what he has to say.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-chromebook-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus"><span>Best Chromebook: Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-14.jpg" alt="Empty desktop on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick:</strong> Not many of us had Samsung releasing a Chromebook on our "2024 Bingo Cards," yet here we are with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>. Considering that it's been about three years since the last Samsung Chromebook was released, this latest offering makes a splash in a few different ways.</p><p>For one, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is the thinnest 15.6-inch Chromebook that's ever been released. With that, it weighs just 2.58 pounds, making it one of the lighter laptops out there, and not just in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook category</a>. Not to mention that Samsung still managed to squeeze a bunch of ports into this beast, including a full-size HDMI port and even a microSD Card slot.</p><p>Outside of the screen and design, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus was the first Chromebook to be released with the new "Quick Insert Key." This is Google's way of trying to make it easier to use and interact with Gemini in various ways. The best part is that the Quick Insert Key can be used across the entirety of ChromeOS and isn't just limited to Google's own apps.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus</p><p>Without naming any names, there was one member of the Android Central staff who voted for something other than the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. So with that, Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus makes it onto the podium, but it's not just for the sake of avoiding a Samsung sweep.</p><p>The Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is a fantastic device in its own right, arguably offering better versatility than the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. In addition to the included AI features and all-day battery life, the Flex 5i also sports a convertible design, complete with a touchscreen display — two things that you won't find on Samsung's latest Chromebook.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-tablet-samsung-galaxy-s10-ultra"><span>Best Android tablet: Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6j72Dx7E2yDydzZ2tjwR4c" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-with-keyboard-case-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra in Book Cover Keyboard case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6j72Dx7E2yDydzZ2tjwR4c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick: </strong>Without burying the lede, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> is the staff's pick for best tablet of the year. However, it's not quite as clear-cut of a victory compared to years past. Functionally speaking, the Tab S10 Ultra is still probably the closest you'll get to being a true laptop replacement, thanks to its massive 14.6-inch display.</p><p>All of the regular bells and whistles are on board, such as the included S Pen in the box, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>, and, of course, there's plenty of AI to go around. Samsung even kept the design practically identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>, meaning that you don't need to run out and buy a new case if you want to upgrade.</p><p>However, this is the first time in years that Samsung's flagship tablet hasn't been powered by a Qualcomm chip. Instead, Samsung opted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>, which is quite impressive, but the decision does leave us scratching our heads a bit.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus Pad 2, RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</p><p>As for the runner-up, well, there are actually two. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/nubias-new-gaming-tablet-crushes-the-competition-with-a-premium-chipset-and-built-in-fan">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a> tied for second place. Unlike Samsung's offering, both of these tablets are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but take very different approaches.</p><p>The OnePlus Pad 2 is more of a refinement over the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a>, with most of the "drastic" changes coming via the software. Released alongside the Pad 2 are the OnePlus Pad Smart Keyboard and Stylo 2. The obvious goal is to offer a portable productivity powerhouse, especially when paired with a OnePlus phone.</p><p>When it comes to the RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet, the premise is right in the name. RedMagic is becoming synonymous with gaming, catering to a niche that just wants the fastest and most powerful devices possible. And that's exactly what you get from the Nova Gaming Tablet, at least until the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> tablets start to arrive.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm going to be honest here, I didn't really know much about XR or Smart Glasses, until I had to edit and follow the work of my incredibly knowledgeable colleague Nick Sutrich. <br><br>Through reading his extensive coverage of the world of XR and Smart Glasses, it's been a lot easier for me to understand how important these two categories have become in the world of Android. And especially with the big announcement that Google and Samsung will launch Android XR as a Meta Quest competitor next year, this mixed-reality space is only going to get more exciting.</p><p>For now, congrats to Meta for the Meta Quest 3S, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and for the best games, we have Batman: Arkham Shadow and Just Dance! <br><br>Here's what Nick had to say.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-xr-headset-or-smart-glasses-meta-quest-3s"><span>Best XR headset or smart glasses: Meta Quest 3S</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VmhgPSSJMmbqhSEKmJkgyS" name="Meta-Quest-3S-with-controllers" alt="A Meta Quest 3S headset with both of its included controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VmhgPSSJMmbqhSEKmJkgyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> The XR industry continued to grow during 2024, and a few devices have helped attract new users, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3S</a>. Meta’s latest headset is our XR device of the year because it delivers unparalleled value in the space, helping to bring in new users and give Quest 2 users an easy upgrade path without spending a ton of money. It might have the Quest 2’s lenses and display, but everything else is a massive upgrade, including the next-gen Snapdragon chipset inside.</p><p>Not only that, but Meta included Batman: Arkham Shadow for free with every Meta Quest 3S, further enticing new users into the fold with a series they know and love. For $299, Meta somehow included almost everything that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> a fantastic experience, including the new controllers with better haptics and full-color, high-resolution passthrough vision. It’s created an explosion of fantastic mixed reality games, and it’s going to help usher in a new wave of next-gen VR games in 2025 and beyond.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</p><p>While these technically came out in 2023, Meta basically relaunched the entire product category with the introduction of Meta AI tools on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> back in April. Further updates were launched in September, including live translation and other impressive multimodal AI features right from your face. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">Live AI</a> and music recognition, among other features, were added just a few days ago, showing that Meta is all about keeping these glasses as useful and relevant as possible.</p><p>Of course, all the base perks of the glasses from last year still stand. They’re a relatively affordable pair of frames with support for nearly all prescription types. I love wearing mine as a replacement for earbuds more often than not, and they’re mind-blowingly handy for taking phone calls, snapping quick pictures or videos (hands-free!), or just listening and responding to messages without having to stare at your phone.</p>

<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> This year has been a stupendous year for VR gaming, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> shines even among the crowded room for its excellence in game design, storytelling, voice acting, and unique gameplay mechanics that perfectly translate the Arkham experience to Meta Quest 3 headsets. Batman: Arkham Shadow takes home our 2024 VR single-player game of the year award.</p><p>Arkham Shadow’s original story takes place between Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum, letting you explore the Blackgate Prison in a way never before seen in a Batman game. You’ll switch between two characters throughout the story to undercover the identity behind the Rat King and experience the most authentic way to feel what Batman feels: by donning the cowl, your unofficial detective badge, and a license to beat up anyone who’s had it coming.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-multi-player-vr-game-just-dance-vr-welcome-to-dancity"><span>Best new multi-player VR game: Just Dance VR – Welcome to Dancity</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D2ZpsvRmjhye4dhBop2kmE" name="Just-Dance-VR" alt="Screenshot of Just Dance VR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2ZpsvRmjhye4dhBop2kmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> The long-awaited VR entry into the storied Just Dance series is the best way to learn the moves you’ve always wanted to, all to your favorite songs of the day. But we’ve been there and done that for the past 15 years with the series, so why did it get our 2024 VR multiplayer game of the year award? Because of Dancity.</p><p>Ubisoft and co-developer Soul Assembly put together a brilliant way to not only play and dance with friends but also to hang out with them in a spectacular “metaverse” style world called Dancity. It makes the game come alive in ways the series has never done before, and it makes playing the multiplayer component not only feel unique but also like a cohesive experience that we simply didn’t expect from a rhythm game.</p><p>Check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/just-dance-vr-welcome-to-dancity/6646371635430939/">Just Dance VR – Welcome to Dancity</a> today!</p>

<ul><li>Two new Samsung devices have already passed through the GSMA database.</li><li>The first is the Galaxy Z Flip FE, carrying a model number of SM-F761B.</li><li>The other is the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with a model number of SM-L505U.</li></ul>
<p>While foldable phones have seen their ups and downs, many have been wondering if Samsung would give its offerings the "Fan Edition (FE)" treatment. Usually, when there's a new Galaxy FE device, this means that it's a bit more budget-friendly compared to its non-FE counterparts.</p><p>It seems that Samsung is already gearing up for its next lineup of foldable phones, as the "Galaxy Z Flip XE" was spotted in the GSMA database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-and-galaxy-watch8-classic-in-the-works/">SmartPrix</a>.) If you were hoping for this listing to share any specifics, you're a bit out of luck. However, the database listing does seem to confirm the model number of SM-F761B.</p><p>Samsung has been rumored to be looking into releasing a cheaper foldable phone. In late November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">rumors suggested</a> Samsung would release the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7, while being powered by the Exynos 2400e.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the same chip found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, offering solid performance while offering Samsung a way to come in at a lower cost. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is said to be powered by the Exynos 2500, which has yet to be officially announced.</p><p>Recently, a report surfaced suggesting that Samsung is drastically lowering sales expectations for its 2025 foldable phones. The company is reportedly planning to sell five million units, with the Flip 7 accounting for three million, and the Fold 7 covering the rest. That being said, this most recent report doesn't take into account the possible release of the Flip 7 FE.</p><p>That being said, Samsung's summer 2025 launch event might have a bit more than just a new foldable phone. Actually, the company could end up bringing back a fan favorite, but not in the form of the Fan Edition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zf4zp3Q9kXJw3piCVVngMk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-Ultra-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (left, silver) and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (right, black) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zf4zp3Q9kXJw3piCVVngMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SmartPrix found another unannounced Samsung device in the GSMA database. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic and its SM-L505U model number also made an appearance.</p><p>This is particularly interesting as there was no "Classic" included with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> lineup. Instead, Samsung opted for the Watch 7 in two sizes, with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> launching alongside.</p><p>The main distinction between the "regular" Watch and the Watch Classic is the physical rotating bezel. While Samsung has been offering a touch-sensitive bezel on the Watch for a few years, it's still not quite as reliable as having the physical option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-bezel.jpeg" alt="A close-up side-view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, focused on the rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, it feels as though Samsung is taking an "on again, off again" approach with the Classic. So from that perspective, it makes sense for this to be an option with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, but there are some who wish Samsung would just keep this as part of the yearly refresh.</p><p>Before getting too excited about a shift to an earlier release schedule, it's not uncommon for unannounced devices to pass through these kinds of databases early. With that in mind, we don't expect any official announcement until sometime in the summer of 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung appears to be including a crash detection virtual sensor on the upcoming Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>Although similar or identical sensors have appeared on prior Samsung devices, the company hasn't rolled out a feature making use of them.</li><li>It's still unclear whether Samsung plans to introduce a car crash detection feature on the Galaxy S25 series or with One UI 7.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung might finally catch up to Apple and Google by including a critical safety feature on the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-car-crash-detection-sensor-3511840/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, leaked code strings from the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra reveal that the company will once again include a virtual car crash sensor. It's worth noting that although past Galaxy phones have included a similar or identical sensor, Samsung hasn't released a car crash detection feature yet.</p><p>The leaked files mention a <strong>Car Crash Detect Wakeup</strong> sensor, which is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> sensor of the same name as ones previously spotted on the Galaxy S24 series and select Samsung foldables. This sensor is not a single hardware sensor in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a virtual sensor that compiles data from multiple hardware sensors in an effort to detect when a car crash has occurred.</p><p>Being that Samsung keeps including the Car Crash Detect Wakeup sensor, it appears that the company is still working on bringing a car crash detection feature to Galaxy phones. The brand is clearly behind the curve. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel">Google added a car crash detection feature to Pixel phones</a> way back and 2019 and Apple followed suit in 2022.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G2jTwQ3PkYe4RjaFE8FhMm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-white-back-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G2jTwQ3PkYe4RjaFE8FhMm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, as Android Authority notes, this isn't a guarantee that a working feature will be available on the Galaxy S25 series. There have been code strings and hidden system apps hinting at car crash detection since as early as 2023, but a public and working feature has not been made available yet. Sometimes, these safety features are region locked, but there's no evidence of car crash detection being available on Samsung devices in any region.</p><p>The good news is that, theoretically, the virtual sensor's inclusion in the Galaxy S25 series codebase means Samsung's upcoming flagships will get car crash detection whenever it becomes available as part of One UI. At the moment, it's not available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>.</p>

However, it might not be long before even more major announcements are made, Gemini will be at the forefront for most of it.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/27/google-ceo-pichai-tells-employees-the-stakes-are-high-for-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNBC</a>, Google held a "2025 strategy meeting" in mid-December, where Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Google executives laid out expectations for the coming years. Pichai even went so far as to say that "the stakes are high" and that "2025 will be critical."</p><p>This comes following a barrage of court trials, some of which are related to Google's advertisement practices, and another that could see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-files-counter-doj-chrome-proposal">Chrome</a> and Android needing to be sold. All the while, Google continues to invest heavily into Gemini, with Pichai stating that "scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C" name="Gemini-2.0" alt="The Gemini 2.0 graphic provided by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looking-at-the-mobile-tech-market-in-2025">past month alone</a>, Google has introduced quite a few updates to Gemini. These include things such as the Deep Research feature, which is touted as "your personal AI research assistant," and is already available. At the same time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental</a> was announced, providing an updated AI model supporting multimodal inputs, while outperforming Gemini 1.5 Pro "on key benchmarks, at twice the speed."</p><p>A goal within Google is for Gemini to become the company's "next app to reach half a billion users." However, Pichai confirmed that there are some challenges ahead, and expects "some back and forth." Ultimately, Pichai believes that Gemini can lead the industry while stating "In history, you don't always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product."</p><p>From there, Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, claimed that "the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two." Hassabis went on to provide a bit of a goal, aiming for "a universal assistant that can seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And if you're wondering where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a> stands in all of this, Hassabis shared that it "will be updated in the first half of the year." In early December, Google made it possible to sign up for the "trusted tester waitlist," however, the floodgates have not been opened just yet.</p><p>As if there wasn't enough pressure from various government agencies, Google is also feeling the pressure from OpenAI. The AI giant recently concluded its "12 days of ship-mas," where a variety of new features were introduced. Arguably the biggest of which was Sora, which lets you create AI-generated videos using nothing more than a text prompt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP" name="ChatGPT-hero.jpg" alt="ChatGPT conversation screen on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only that, but OpenAI also announced some major improvements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-feature-rollout">ChatGPT Search</a>, clearly setting Google in its sights. And not to be outdone by Gemini 2.0, OpenAI revealed its o3 and o3 mini AI models, which are said to offer a substantial improvement over the previous o1 and o1 mini models.</p><p>However, OpenAI also recently introduced ChatGPT Pro, a new subscription priced at $200 per month. By signing up, you are provided "with the highest level of access," including unlimited access to GPT-4o, o1, and advanced voice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Sge3x7PigWQGRRhrfz2HXf" name="chatgpt-pricing-12-2024" alt="ChatGPT Subscription plans as of December 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sge3x7PigWQGRRhrfz2HXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is one area of concern for everyone who's even tangentially interested in the future of AI, including whether Google plans to charge similar prices to access Gemini. In the meeting, Hassabis reportedly responded by saying "Right now, we don't have any plans for this kind of subscription level." Of course, there's nothing to say that this couldn't change tomorrow, but it does offer a bit of reprieve if you have concerns.</p><p>Providing a roadmap for what it expects to achieve in 2025 is just one piece of the puzzle. It's even more important to follow through, reach, and maybe even surpass those goals. Needless to say, it'll be quite interesting to see how everything plays out over the course of the next 12 months.</p>

<ul><li>A leak sheds some light on what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2.</li><li>Some of the expected improvements include an IPX8 rating, wireless charging, and a larger battery.</li><li>The Open 2 is said to be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, and will see a "global release in late Q1 2025."</li></ul>
<p>After OnePlus and parent company Oppo made the curious decision to forego a new foldable phone in 2024, it appears that won't be the case for 2025. A new leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oneplus-open-2-first-look/">SmartPrix</a> shares a couple of renders for the OnePlus Open 2, while also revealing some of the key improvements we can expect to see.</p><p>According to the provided renders, it appears that the OnePlus Open 2 will largely retain the same design as its predecessor. This includes the round and massive rear camera module, housing a triple-lens setup. It's expected to be headlined by a 50MP main lens, while also including a 50MP ultrawide lens and a 50MP telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yTZcKqiZRTr9mRmHka5vG4" name="oneplus-open-2-rear-camera-smartprix-leak" alt="OnePlus Open 2 rear camera leak from SmartPrix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTZcKqiZRTr9mRmHka5vG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="2560" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, the rumored specs are what we expected, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> powering the Open 2. SmartPrix claims OnePlus will pair this chip with 16GB of RAM and "a generous 1TB of storage." It's unclear whether this will be the only configuration available, or if the OnePlus Open 2 will also come with 512GB of storage.</p><p>As for the displays, we're expecting a 6.4-inch AMOLED Cover Screen, which is slightly larger compared to the original Open (6.31-inch.) This isn't the only difference to be found, as OnePlus is also rumored to use a larger 8-inch LTPO inner screen with a 2K resolution, and 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="W2qi2EFZjWXrttheoT7jP4" name="oneplus-open-2-inner-screen-smartprix-leak" alt="OnePlus Open 2 inner display leak from SmartPrix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2qi2EFZjWXrttheoT7jP4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Keeping with the idea of "bigger, faster, better," these latest rumors suggest OnePlus will introduce a larger 5,900mAh battery. This offers a massive improvement over the 4,800mAh cell from its predecessor. Speaking of which, the lack of wireless charging was a sticking point for some, but that won't be the case with the Open 2. In addition to the 80W wired charging speeds, the Open 2 is expected to also offer up to 50W wireless charging.</p><p>That's not all that SmartPrix had to share, as the Open 2 is said to "measure just under 10mm thin." The exact dimensions weren't provided, but if this comes to fruition, it would be even thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> (10.5mm when folded.) Lastly, the Open 2 is expected to offer better water resistance with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">IPX8 rating</a>, an improvement over the IPX4 from the previous model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-22.jpg" alt="Comparing the thickness between the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, the Open 2 will essentially be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, as with the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and Find N4. The Find N5 is said to arrive "in China early next year, followed by a global release in late Q1 2025." SmartPrix goes on to say that the launch of the Open 2 will likely coincide with that of the Find N5.</p><p>If everything goes according to plan, the OnePlus Open 2 and Oppo Find N5 could be the first two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> released in 2025. However, there's always a chance that issues crop up, delaying one of the most highly anticipated new phone releases.</p>

The Watch FE was too downgraded, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a> a bit too safe and same-y, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a> too expensive for anyone besides me to have tried, no matter how excellent it was.</p><p>Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> was the overwhelming favorite, a fast, decently long-lasting smartwatch with improved running tools for couch-to-5Kers. It was one of my favorite reviews of the year, and many of my colleagues ditched their old watches for a Watch 3 this year.</p><p>I think most people were happy to finally have a larger display with a smaller bezel — not to mention the doubled brightness and smoother refresh rate — but I think our collective excitement came down to the Watch 3 still feeling fresh. People prefer its soft-edged, striking style to the Galaxy Watch’s flat, unchanged look, even if it’s more durable. And as a bunch of Google power users, they’re most excited by new Google Home integrations that make the Watch 3 interconnected with their other devices.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus Watch 2R</p><p>The more competitive battle was for the runner-up slot. The Galaxy Watch 7 got a couple of votes, while Garmin spread out its votes among different options. But a dark horse swooped in: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, which I also gave a strong review. In this case, it’s the clear inverse of the Pixel Watch 3: not very attractive or strong for health insights, but much more affordable, far stronger for battery life, and just as fast for overall performance. It’s the mid-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> we’ve been waiting for.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-ring-oura-ring-4"><span>Best smart ring: Oura Ring 4</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-09.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 with the Android Bot figure" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Derrek Lee: </strong>Smart rings are still a growing market, but Oura has proven that there’s plenty of merit in the form factor. The arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, along with a slew of new contenders, big and small, shows that consumers are interested. At first glance, Oura’s latest model may not look like a huge upgrade from its predecessor, but the company has made some significant changes to enhance the overall experience while improving accuracy and battery life.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 refines the design for a more comfortable and durable fit, making it perfect to wear while sleeping in case you don’t like to wear your smartwatch to bed. However, the updated design isn’t just cosmetic; the flush sensors are arranged in such a way that readings should be more accurate with more pathways between sensors.</p><p>This is aided by Oura’s new Smart Sensing technology, which not only improves the ring’s health tracking but also extends battery life. And with the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">automatic activity tracking</a>, the ring not only detects workouts like running, biking, HIIT, and yoga, but it will also automatically monitor your heart rate when it does, so you don’t have to manually track workouts for more comprehensive data.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Ultrahuman Ring Air</p><p>There are plenty of impressive smart rings in the market, but the runner-up on our list is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, which has been giving Oura a run for its money in more ways than one. It has a comfortable fit and comes with great sleep-tracking features. And like Oura, Ultrahuman has also been adding new features to its ring, even some you can’t find on the Oura Ring, like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-dont-more-smartwatches-use-this-smart-rings-seemingly-obvious-trick">cool new smart alarm</a>. And the best part is that, unlike Oura, there’s no subscription to use its most useful features.</p>

Google’s Pixel 9 Pro was hands down the best Android phone this year. With its seamless Gemini integration, beautiful design, and amazing features, it truly was the phone that beat all phones this year.</p><p>We can’t discount the OnePlus 12 because not only was it a great phone, but it also helped Android Central determine that OnePlus really has been the most improved Android brand of the year.</p><p>I think what shocked me the most was that there weren’t that many great foldable releases from Google or Samsung, and most of the better foldable phones this year came from brands outside of the U.S. Honor’s Magic V3 clearly made the best foldable this year. Of course, the phone that consistently impresses me is the Razr Plus 2024, which was this year's best flip phone winner. <br><br>Here's what some of my colleagues have to say about the winners. Congratulations!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-phone-google-pixel-9-pro"><span>Best Android phone: Google Pixel 9 Pro</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JaJqwiBjS57HpxKCJecRSJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="OnePlus 12 next to Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JaJqwiBjS57HpxKCJecRSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich: </strong>In a sea of phones that feel similar, Google has done a monumental job of making a phone that feels different — even if it looks a little too much like an iPhone on the outside for some of us. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> is Android Central’s favorite phone of the year because of its ability to pack the best of the Pixel 9 Pro XL in a smaller body, including the killer triple rear cameras that used to only come on the biggest and most expensive Pixel phones.</p><p>Not only that, but Google’s ability to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> at the core of the Pixel experience to differentiate it from the pack is something to celebrate. Great new apps like Pixel Screenshots are game changers for what Google does best — search — while improvements to the overall interface and user experience with useful AI features made this the favorite of most Android Central staff.</p><p>It might not have received the highest score of all the premium phones we reviewed this year, but there’s something special about the Pixel 9 Pro that kept us coming back and wanting more despite the faults we found with it.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus 12</p><p>Our runner-up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. I’ll admit it: I haven’t cared about a OnePlus phone in years, and based on the numbers, most of you haven’t either. But the OnePlus 12 changed all that, and it not only got people talking about the brand again, but it also got them to start buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> again.</p><p>Everything about this phone exhibits the best of OnePlus. From feature-rich software that’s blazing fast and smoother than any other phone to stupidly fast charging that gets you a top-up in minutes and even one of the most eye-friendly OLEDs in the business, it’s nearly impossible not to love the OnePlus 12. That makes it our runner-up for best phone of the year.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-value-phone-google-pixel-8a"><span>Best value phone: Google Pixel 8a</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PuWJAtnvr8uYPKVpSrWtUJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="OnePlus 12R next to Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PuWJAtnvr8uYPKVpSrWtUJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> It should come as no surprise that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> is the best mid-range phone of 2024. It continues to have the best cameras in this category, and Google did a great job with the design this time — if anything, I prefer it to the Pixel 9 Pro in this regard. While the camera modules aren't the latest, Google excels at eking out the best possible photos and videos; there are other phones that come close to the Pixel 8a, but none can meet its consistency.</p><p>Google also made positive strides with the OLED panel, and it now goes up to 120Hz and gets significantly brighter even under harsh sunlight. These are all positive improvements, but it's the software that makes the Pixel 8a truly stand out — it is the only mid-range phone with a clean interface and long-term update guarantee. With Google promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">seven years of Android OS updates</a>, it will stay relevant until 2031, which isn't the case with any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">affordable Android phone</a>.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus 12R</p><p>Coming in second is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. OnePlus decided to sell the phone globally starting this year, and that ultimately turned out to be the right call; the phone has the best hardware package in this segment, and although I still give the edge to the Pixel 8a because of its software, the 12R is much better at gaming, has a bigger battery, and unmatched fast charging tech.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-camera-phone-vivo-x100-series"><span>Best camera phone: Vivo X100 series</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ" name="vivo-x100-ultra-26.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich: </strong>Android Central staff voted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best phone camera</a> of the year, but the results weren’t even close. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review" target="_blank">Vivo X100</a> series took home 14 of our 20 total votes, and it’s no surprise, given how effectively the phone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/replacing-my-dslr-with-vivo-x100-pro">replace a DSLR-style camera</a> in most situations. Vivo’s software is extremely user-friendly yet offers powerful options for folks who need it to do more than they might expect from a phone.</p><p>My favorite part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo experience</a> is the convincing portrait-style photos the phone creates from nearly any zoom level and with any subject. Taking photos of your food is suddenly transformed into a magazine-quality experience, and everything from group photos to landscape shots is simply stunning thanks to the phone’s accurate colors, crisp details, and ability to capture motion without that telltale smartphone blur.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Google Pixel 9 Pro</p><p>The runner-up is no surprise because Google Pixel phones typically win the best camera in any given year. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the best camera you can buy in the U.S., without a doubt. Google’s photo quality is always top-notch, and it is one of the most reliable camera phones you can use. When you take a photo with a Pixel, there’s almost never a time it’s not a good photo.</p><p>Google ramped things up a notch this year with awesome new features like Add Me, which help get the photographer in the group shot by cleverly using AI to stitch two pictures together. Thanks to some excellent UI design and features that are consistently fun to use, the Pixel 9 Pro is the camera phone to get if you can’t get a Vivo X100.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Myrick:</strong> Well, wouldn't you know it? Neither Samsung nor Google will take home the "best foldable phone" crown in 2024. Instead, it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> that continues to turn heads and impress despite not even being available in North America.</p><p>The Magic V3 packs a punch in all the right ways, starting with a design that is both incredibly sleek and light. As noted in our review, "The Galaxy S24 Ultra is 2g heavier than the Magic V3," which is just insane when you consider the V3 provides a 6.43-inch cover display and a 7.92-inch inner screen.</p><p>Honor made very few sacrifices with the Magic V3, with the biggest issue being the "average battery life." Besides that, we have flagship specs across the board, with the V3 being powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Honor didn't skimp on the cameras either, with the array comprised of a 50MP main, 50MP periscope telephoto, and a 40MP ultrawide.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</p><p>Coming in second place was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which Google took in a completely unexpected direction. Instead of attempting to refine the passport style from the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, the 9 Pro Fold is more in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and the aforementioned Honor Magic V3.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cover screen is the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> while unfolding to reveal a beautiful 8-inch AMOLED display. It's powered by Google's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. Even the battery life is fantastic, easily lasting for more than a day with regular use. We just really wish it had the same cameras as the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jd2WofGy5Vkrr4SVFvsnaS" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-hero-16-9.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 open at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jd2WofGy5Vkrr4SVFvsnaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4073" height="2291" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Derrek Lee:</strong> Motorola has had something of a resurgence in recent years. While Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip lineup has been pretty same-y for the past couple of generations, Motorola came out of left field with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">revamped Razr in 2023</a>, then gave it a pretty substantial upgrade in 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> is technically not the most powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> on the market — that distinction goes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and its more powerful chipset — however, Motorola makes up for it in other ways, with the overall experience culminating in a phone that I haven’t wanted to put down since I got my hands on it. The design feels so refined with a strong hinge, IPX8 water resistance, and vegan leather on the back of every model.</p><p>I also have almost no complaints about the specs; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8S Gen 3</a> and 12GB of RAM feel plenty speedy, the 4,000mAh battery doesn’t make me feel nervous, and the new 50MP primary camera takes photos that I can actually use. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">4-inch cover screen</a> is a blast to use, with access to nearly all of your apps.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Xiaomi Mix Flip</p><p>While the Razr Plus 2024 won nearly unanimously, the runner-up was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi Mix Flip</a>, which features a more powerful Snapdragon chipset and an equally large (although bigger by 0.01 inches) cover screen. As Xiaomi’s first flip phone, the Mix Flip is quite impressive, with a stunning design, a great set of Leica-powered cameras, and a shockingly large battery for a flip phone. The only problem is that the phone isn’t available in North America or Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> OnePlus had a standout 2024, and the manufacturer didn't put a foot wrong in the last 12 months. The OnePlus Open is still one of the best foldables around, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> is a terrific mid-range tablet, and the OnePlus 12R is a viable alternative to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>But it's the OnePlus 12 that's particularly notable. While OnePlus rolled out flagships for the better part of a decade, its earlier efforts couldn't quite measure up to what Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Google had to offer. That changed with the OnePlus 12, with the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">delivering much better cameras</a>, a brighter AMOLED with eye-friendly tech, and class-leading battery life.</p><p>OnePlus managed to address several of its shortcomings this year, and the fact that it now has devices to take on the best flagships, as well as mid-range phones, makes it truly deserving of the moniker of the most improved brand of 2024.</p>

Last week, I looked back on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">Wear OS's strongest year yet</a> and promised that I'd share my predictions for what could happen with Android smartwatches in 2025. So here I am, bearing the promise of presents for loyal Wear OS users — and a couple of lumps of pessimistic coal.</p><p>I'm optimistic that 2025 will be a transformative year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, building off of 2024's strong foundation and the long-awaited payoff of new Snapdragon hardware and Google's Gemini push.</p><p>That said, we can also see warning signs in what happened in 2024 that could lead to some angst for Android watch owners this year — depending on which brand you own. So good and bad, let's break down what we expect to see from Wear OS watches in 2025, both for hardware and software!</p>
<h2 id="new-snapdragon-hardware-and-a-swap-to-risc-v-2">New Snapdragon hardware (and a swap to RISC-V)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6" name="snapdragon-wear-01.jpg" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear chip inside of a smartwatch with a bokeh background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google, Mobvoi, OnePlus, and Xiaomi used the 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 SoC</a> in nearly all of their Wear OS watches over the last 2.5 years. Unlike annual smartphone chips, watches don't have an application like gaming that requires much headroom; these watches are speedy enough with 2GB of RAM and old silicon. Still, it's fair to expect an upgrade in 2025, as the latest Wear used a Cortex-A53 core first announced in 2012.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">interviewed Qualcomm VP Dino Bekis about Snapdragon Wear</a> in October, and he all but promised that they'd have a Snapdragon Wear chip announcement in 2025. While he offered no specifics about cores, he described it as a "feature-focused" and "AI-driven" chip that could "scale for multiple years" because it'll have enough compute capability to specialize in whatever tools OEMs want.</p><p>Assuming it follows Qualcomm's naming conventions, the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 would probably power most Wear OS watches through 2027. It may use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V</a>, the open-source, energy-efficient platform with custom cores that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">Qualcomm and Google first partnered on in 2023</a>.</p><p>Bekis said the two companies are still working on porting Wear OS software to RISC-V and that the transition could make Wear OS watches longer-lived, with "a week's worth of battery life" as the goal. I doubt we'll hit that anytime soon, but it's something to hope for.</p><p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, called the potential RISC-V switch "extremely interesting," praising that they'd have cheaper custom chips specialized for the application and that it would "open the door" for new tools. He warned me that he "thinks RISC-V will still take a bit longer than anticipated," but "the payoff could be huge." That could lead Google into looking for alternatives for its Pixel Watch 4, if it's not ready by the 2025 deadline.</p>
<h2 id="google-faces-a-snapdragon-tensor-crossroads-2">Google faces a Snapdragon/Tensor crossroads</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i" name="google-pixel-watch-3-google-tv-controls.jpg" alt="Google TV controls on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Do Wear OS apps need a fancy next-gen processor? Or is "Tensor" enough? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'd reasonably assume the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> will use the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, but one leak suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">Google might play it safe</a> and develop a Tensor chip in-house that's essentially a lower-powered version of the Exynos W1000 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, with a 2020 Cortex-A78 core and two Cortex-A55 cores.</p><p>Google's current Tensor strategy with <em>phones</em> is to focus more on in-house development (partnered with Samsung LSI) and powerful AI performance at the expense of benchmarked power. Google could take a similar approach with watches, deciding it doesn't <em>need</em> much headroom and putting more emphasis on a powerful NPU for Gemini tasks rather than pay Qualcomm a premium to license its Snapdragon chips.</p><p>Google's partnership with Samsung underpins Wear OS's success, and staying in lockstep would make joint software development easier. <em>Or</em> it'll go all-in on RISC-V to try and differentiate its Pixel family from Samsung's. I can only speculate on which path Google will take; I <em>hope</em> it chooses the latter, simply because it would make the Pixel Watch 4 in 2025 more intriguing, while also worrying that Google will take the safer route.</p>
<h2 id="health-and-fitness-will-remain-a-primary-focus-2">Health and fitness will remain a primary focus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t64tqjPgwPtjWuQ8AKC73b" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-samsung-health-water-energy-score.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 showing water monitoring and energy scores in Samsung Health" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t64tqjPgwPtjWuQ8AKC73b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is such a safe bet that I won't spend too long dwelling on it. However, Wear OS 6 will continue Google and Samsung's quest to try to keep up with fitness rivals like Apple and Garmin.</p><p>A healthy portion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and One UI 6 Watch updates focused on health features (e.g., sleep apnea / Energy Score / Cardio Load) and workout tools (e.g., AI coaching / running form analysis / pace or HR goals during workouts).</p><p>With Wear OS 6 watches, Google will hopefully add dual-band GPS like Samsung, as well as focus on other sports like cycling and weightlifting to complement its newfound running focus. Samsung will probably copy Google and Apple and implement some form of training load feature, showing the short- and long-term impact of workouts.</p><p>We could also see new health tools, but I'll remain skeptical of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">non-invasive blood glucose</a> until it happens, no matter how many times companies say they <em>want</em> to do it. And I don't know what other non-gimmicky data points these companies have left to add; maybe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-patent-shows-plans-to-monitor-mental-health">mental health</a> will be the next smartwatch focus.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-will-blow-up-on-smartwatches-2">Gemini will blow up on smartwatches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google spent 2024 cramming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into every Google service and product that could support it, and ended the year promising that Gemini would be the baseline for its new smart glasses OS, Android XR. Even if I don't have any evidence, I'm fairly confident Google will make Gemini available with Wear OS 6 as a Pixel Watch 4 killer app — possibly a stripped-down version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>.</p><p>This assumes Google can take Gemini Nano — the "smallest" version for smartphone on-device AI tools — and port it down to work on a smartwatch processor. It might depend on what kind of power the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 can deliver, and could shut out current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> with last-gen hardware not designed for Gemini.</p><p>"On the Gemini front, I think Google still needs to figure out a way to get Gemini to run smoothly on such performance-limited hardware," Sag told me. "That could come with RISC-V or some other more capable platform." But he agreed that "right now I don't think Google Assistant performance is where it should be," and said that he could see AI becoming "the connective fabric between all of our wearables."</p><p>If I'm wrong that Gemini can be scaled down to wearable form, I still expect Google to add more AI-powered tricks to Wear OS in some form. For example, it could add its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-labs-insight-explorer-test-gemini-start">Fitbit Insight Explorer</a> to the Pixel Watch 4, so you could ask for context about your recent workouts — similar to Zepp Coach on Amazfit watches.</p><p>Samsung, which has always offered Bixby and Assistant, would also get access to Gemini. It recently unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives">Bixby AI</a> with LLM capabilities, but it's exclusive to Chinese phones for now; we don't know if it'd be ready by the Galaxy Watch 8. Still, One UI 6 Watch had plenty of AI tricks like Energy Score and auto-suggested replies, and Samsung will probably focus on other niche features, with a mix of cloud computing and on-device tricks.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-won-t-go-the-squircle-route-with-galaxy-watch-8-2">Samsung WON'T go the squircle route with Galaxy Watch 8</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In March 2024, SamMobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">reported inside knowledge</a> that Samsung was "looking to bring back the squarish design for its smartwatches," with "enthusiastic" internal support for the plan. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> seemed the most likely candidate.</p><p>Samsung hasn't sold a squircle watch since the Gear S in 2014; although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> <em>looks</em> more square-shaped due to its titanium bezel, the display is still circular. At the time, some Galaxy Watch fans <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">resented the idea</a> of abandoning the traditional watch look for the squircle design so closely associated with Apple Watches.</p><p>I didn't mind the idea at the time and found the report plausible. But I recently remembered this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">August report</a> that Samsung chairman Lee Jae-yong allegedly lambasted the MX Division for "design plagiarism," with the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro 3</a> too similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and AirPods Pro in features and looks.</p><p>Lee's "angry" response makes me doubt that Samsung's internal enthusiasm for squircles will make it onto a mainline Galaxy Watch. Even if Samsung designed a squircle watch before Samsung, most people would still see it as copying Apple, and that seems to be a sore spot for its chairman.</p><p>So don't be surprised if the Galaxy Watch 8 looks a lot like the last <em>four</em> Galaxy Watches: machine-cut, flat, and bezel-less. As for other models, we're due for our biannual Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Samsung might keep selling the Ultra as is for another year before progressing to the Ultra 2 (or abandoning it like it did the Watch 5 Pro).</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-will-bring-back-facer-2">Wear OS will bring back Facer</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing two Pokemon cheering for you on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This may be nothing more than wishful thinking since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">Facer was one of my favorite Wear OS apps</a> before Google made the XML Watch Face Format the default on Wear OS 5 to extend battery life and left the decade-old app and its developers high and dry. But I want Facer back, and I think it'll happen in 2025.</p><p>Google won't go back on its restriction and let battery-guzzling faces back on Wear OS; they make the watches look short-lived for aesthetics. But its current solution — scrolling through a long list of watch faces in the Play Store without any organization — is terrible. Facer says it's "working hard with Google to solve this issue" and provide an alternative, and I believe them.</p><p>My guess is that Google will once again allow third-party apps to share watch faces to Wear OS as long as they're XML-coded, which would let Facer back onto new Wear OS watches — even if most of its 500,000 faces aren't compatible anymore. At the very least, fun XML watch faces would be much more findable on Facer, which would, in turn, incentivize developers to start <em>making</em> creative XML faces for us.</p>
<h2 id="my-less-reliable-2025-wear-os-predictions-2">My less reliable 2025 Wear OS predictions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM" name="Wear-OS-watches-hero" alt="A pile of Wear OS watches: The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, 6, 6 Classic, and 5 Pro; the Google Pixel Watch 3 and 2; and the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I've reviewed a lot of Wear OS watches over the past few years, and I'm excited for what 2025 brings! </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of the above is certain, but I at least have evidence or solid reasons for speculating. Now I'll throw out my 2025 Wear OS predictions that aren't based on anything except vibes:</p><p>I won't be surprised if <strong>another Android OEM</strong> makes a Wear OS watch. Motorola, which once sold the Android Wear-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-review-0">Moto 360</a> but now focuses on budget Moto OS trackers, seems like a possible candidate.</p><p>I'm also worried about <strong>slower Wear OS updates</strong> in 2025. Admittedly, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">has been a problem since Wear OS 3</a>, but I'm worried that brands like Mobvoi will really struggle with Wear OS 5 and keep selling Wear OS 4 watches in the interim. And with Wear OS 6, the gap between when new and last-gen watches get it could be even wider.</p><p>We could very well see the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-new-partnership-could-be-the-cure-for-wear-oss-health-data-headaches">Wear OS watch with <strong>Masimo health sensors</strong></a>, though it's possible that the hardware won't be ready to incorporate into watches until after 2025.</p><p>Lastly, I'll go out on a limb and guess that Google will <strong>make Fitbit available on all Wear OS watches in 2025</strong>. Even if it means losing that exclusivity for Pixel Watches, the data payoff would be worth it for them.</p>

Google and Samsung have their own methods of image AI image generation, so it's not surprising that Motorola also has a feature on select devices that lets you do just that.</p><p>Magic Canvas was initially just a way to generate images for wallpapers but has since evolved into something more capable. The feature, which is now part of Motorola's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite, is able to generate impressive images just by typing in a text prompt using various image styles. It works similarly to features like Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio app</a>, meaning owners of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> don't have to miss out on the ability to create fun images they can use as wallpapers or share with friends.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-magic-canvas-2">How to use Magic Canvas</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Press and hold</strong> the home screen to bring up the customization menu.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Wallpapers</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Create with AI</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Magic Canvas</strong>. If you're not already, you may be prompted to sign into your <strong>Moto account</strong>. Tap it and follow the prompts to sign in or create an account, otherwise continue on to the next steps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="RrsakdTY9qwtSXcgZfEcvX" name="Moto-AI-Magic-Canvas-1" alt="Accessing Magic Canvas on a Motorola phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrsakdTY9qwtSXcgZfEcvX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. <strong>Type a prompt</strong> into the Description box.</p><p>6. Select the desired <strong>aspect ratio</strong>. You can choose from 1:1 (square) or 9:16 (portrait orientation).</p><p>7. Select the desired <strong>Style</strong>. Options include Abstract, Cartoon, Fantasy, Futuristic, Impressionist, Minimalist, Pop Art, Realistic, Surreal, and Vintage.</p><p>8. Tap <strong>Generate Image</strong> and wait for the image to finish generating. This should take several seconds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="RnN9PrbCBC9xZnyAeXkubX" name="Moto-AI-Magic-Canvas-2" alt="Generating an image with Magic Canvas" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RnN9PrbCBC9xZnyAeXkubX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the image is generated, you can save it to your gallery, copy it to use later, share it, or set the image as a wallpaper. If you don't like the result, you can tap Redo, and Magic Canvas will generate another version of the image based on your prompt.</p>
<h2 id="get-creating-with-limits-2">Get creating, with limits</h2>
<p>Magic Canvas is a fun tool that lets you run wild with your imagination, allowing you to create fun and unique images on the fly. However, there are limits to the types of images you can create. Magic Canvas may not generate some images if it's perceived to be a sensitive topic, and you'll be met with a warning if you try to generate such images.</p><p>Furthermore, any image created with Magic Canvas will have a watermark in the bottom left corner that reads "AI Generated Image." It may not be as flashy as the watermark on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>-generated images, but it should get the job done to ensure the image is properly tagged.</p><p>Lastly, Magic Canvas is not available on every Motorola phone. The feature appears to be limited to higher-end devices, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr</a> series and Edge 50 series. To check if your phone has Magic Canvas, follow the first couple of steps in this guide to see if it appears in the "Create with AI" section of the Wallpaper settings menu.</p>

The decision ultimately came down to durability, as the dual-curved edges made phones more susceptible to damage if the device was ever dropped. Even so, that shouldn't result in a less comfortable phone, as OnePlus went through many different iterations, with the goal being "for the transition surfaces to better conform to the natural curve of the user's palm while also providing a secure grip," Ruan said.</p><p>OnePlus also worked for over a year on the microfiber leather to ensure it was comfortable and durable. And speaking of durability, you won't find Gorilla Glass on the OnePlus 13, but a custom Ceramic Guard solution, which Ruan says delivers "superior drop protection and scratch resistance."</p><p>Be sure to check out the interview for more on the OnePlus 13 design.

A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20241222000037">ETNews</a> reveals that Samsung may have adjusted its shipments for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Z Flip 7</a> to a total of 5 million units in 2025, down a few million compared to 2024. The reason?</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> were great phones, but they were also fairly iterative upgrades, and lower-than-expected sales may have caused the company to reevaluate its foldable strategy in 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> will apparently see an increase in shipments, with more than 37 million units expected to ship. This figure includes the rumored Galaxy S25 Slim, which the report notes is expected to ship roughly 3 million units.</p><p>Curiously, this report doesn't mention anything about additional foldable models, with Samsung expected to reveal a sequel to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-special-edition-model-numbers-3511581/">Android Authority</a>, the latest One UI 7 beta has revealed model numbers for Samsung's 2025 foldable lineup, which apparently includes the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition 2 (or whatever it's called).</p>

After the success of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, the company may be planning some notable upgrades for the next model.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/77bd9117-0a2d-4bd7-9248-4dd288f695a4">Financial Times</a>, Meta is expected to drop the new glasses during the second half of 2025, and it seems quite possible that the glasses may sport a display. This would be used to show text, like notifications, as well as images and possibly responses from the Meta AI assistant.</p><p>The new glasses will be designed by Meta's partner, EssilorLuxottica, although there's not much information on the wearables.</p><p>Meta has been working on AR glasses, as evidenced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Project Orion</a> prototype it showed us earlier this year. Putting a display on the next-generation Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses would bring the company closer to fully realizing its goal, although the Orion glasses are likely still years away.</p>

<h2 id="foldable-phones-the-future-of-smartphone-design-2">Foldable Phones: The future of smartphone design?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3948px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rgexa8FofRATt7s6ym77dD" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-06.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 next to the Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rgexa8FofRATt7s6ym77dD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3948" height="2221" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the biggest trends in 2025 <em>could</em> be the rise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. Manufacturers are pushing the boundaries of smartphone design, offering devices that seamlessly transition between phone and tablet modes. These devices are becoming more affordable and reliable, making them a compelling option for consumers seeking a versatile mobile experience.</p><p>All it would take is one company's significant breakthrough in hardware or design to get foldables back on track to become the norm instead of an exception. If that doesn't happen, we'll have the same market players doing the same things, and consumers will continue to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-foldable-market-share-q1-2024">largely ignore foldable phones</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) is rapidly integrating into various aspects of mobile technology. AI-powered features are enhancing user experiences in numerous ways, including:</p><p><strong>Smarter personal assistants:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-teases-generative-ai-plans-bixby">Virtual assistants</a> are becoming more intelligent and capable of understanding complex queries and providing tailored recommendations. Much of this is because of AI integration.</p><p><strong>Advanced camera systems:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">AI-driven camera systems</a> are revolutionizing mobile photography, enabling features like real-time object recognition, scene optimization, and stunning low-light performance.</p><p><strong>Enhanced security:</strong> AI is bolstering mobile security by detecting and preventing cyber threats, such as phishing attacks and malware.</p><p>Expect this to continue throughout 2025, with companies trying to find new ways to use AI. Some of them will be great and useful; others will not. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">Like it or not</a>, AI is the future of software. At least until something better comes along.</p>
<h2 id="5g-the-backbone-of-high-speed-connectivity-2">5G: The backbone of high-speed connectivity</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5" name="5g-icon.jpg" alt="5G icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-explained">expectations of 5G</a> were wrong. We don't have blazing-fast network speeds on our phones everywhere and all of the time, and the way the tech works, we never will. Still, 5G has lived up to its promise in other ways, especially when it comes to the backbone that powers everything. It will continue to quietly expand in 2025.</p><p>The widespread deployment of 5G networks is transforming the way we interact with our devices. 5G offers significantly faster speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity, enabling a new era of mobile experiences:</p><p><strong>Cloud Gaming:</strong> 5G empowers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-geforce-now-review">cloud gaming</a> services, allowing users to stream high-quality games without the need for powerful hardware on both mobile devices and laptops.</p><p><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):</strong> 2025 will not be the year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-project-iris-rumor">AR/VR</a> everywhere, but 5G will continue to make the experience better. 5G's high bandwidth and low latency are essential for immersive AR and VR experiences.</p><p><strong>Remote Work and Learning:</strong> 5G facilitates seamless remote work and online learning by enabling high-quality video conferencing and fast file transfers. As the technology rollout continues, more people — especially in rural areas — have access to acceptable internet. That's important, and it will continue to get better.</p>
<h2 id="sustainable-tech-it-has-to-happen-2">Sustainable Tech: It has to happen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:799px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.82%;"><img id="NyUaLQLXBdj7gqd7yCWyqH" name="Samsung-recycling.JPG" alt="Samsung repurposing ocean plastics graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NyUaLQLXBdj7gqd7yCWyqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="799" height="446" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Environmental consciousness is driving a shift towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">sustainable mobile tech</a>. Manufacturers are focusing on eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient designs, and responsible manufacturing practices. Additionally, initiatives to extend the lifespan of devices and reduce electronic waste are gaining traction.</p><p>Phone makers know this has to happen. There is a finite amount of materials available, and as they become more scarce, they also become more expensive. Recycled materials and sustainable manufacturing are the future, and I think we'll see more companies making an actual difference in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-and-opportunities-2">Challenges and opportunities</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1395px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4Vni7Q7Bee3kDi6g3yJqL8" name="mobile-tracking.jpg" alt="Google logo with magnifying glass in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Vni7Q7Bee3kDi6g3yJqL8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1395" height="785" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the mobile tech market is thriving, it faces several growing challenges.</p><p>More people are aware of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-23-million-dollar-search-privacy-settlement">privacy concerns</a> that come with using a smartphone. As devices become more interconnected, concerns about data privacy and security are paramount.</p><p>Despite advancements in battery technology, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ask-jerry-how-can-i-get-more-battery-life-from-my-smartwatch">battery life</a> remains a major concern for many users. Promises of X% more battery aren't cutting it, and we need <em>real</em> advancement.</p><p>Ongoing chip shortages and concerns about possible tariffs imposed in the U.S. may impact the availability and pricing of mobile devices.</p><p>These challenges present opportunities for innovation and growth. By addressing these issues, manufacturers can create more secure, efficient, and user-friendly devices. We may not see this in 2025, but know that phone makers are looking at these areas.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ultimately, 2025 has the potential to be a remarkable year for mobile tech. With advancements in AI, 5G, hardware and design, and sustainable practices, the future of mobile devices could be bright.</p><p>As consumers, we should look forward to and <em>demand</em> a more connected, intelligent, and eco-friendly mobile experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Bad software updates are never anybody's idea of fun, and several Meta Quest owners found this out in the worst way possible when turning on their headsets after Christmas this year.</p><p>The Meta Quest v72 update appears to have rendered some Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> headsets unusable after it failed to install. Owners who received the faulty update headed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Talk-VR/NOT-SOLVED-Unacceptable-Response-to-Software-Update-Breaking/td-p/1273736">Meta forums</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/bricked-quest-report-christmas-2024/">UploadVR</a>) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hmh09n/quest_update_possibly_bricking_headsets/">Reddit</a> to report that their headsets wouldn't boot. Affected users' headsets show a black screen with the error "Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted."</p><p>Meta advises that affected users hold down the power button for 45 seconds before booting up, which should reset the headset and potentially clear out any problems. Users can also try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILG7H4KSFJk">manually flashing the V71 update</a> using Meta's official manual update tool and a smartphone.</p><p>Some users have reported that these steps do not resolve the issue. Meta says the offending update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/Quest-2-3S-3-Software-Update-Issue/ba-p/1277634">has been officially fixed</a> and that users who are still experiencing problems should use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/product-claim/product_selection/">new dedicated replacement page</a> to request a replacement headset. Meta says even people with an outdated warranty should use this site.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta pulled the offending update and is offering free replacement headsets for affected customers via a dedicated support page.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Before Meta established the page, customer service was flaky, at best. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Talk-VR/NOT-SOLVED-Unacceptable-Response-to-Software-Update-Breaking/m-p/1278899/emcs_t/S2h8ZW1haWx8dG9waWNfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE01QjhVODRQUVBXQzY1fDEyNzg4OTl8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw#M399342">several Meta Quest forum posts</a> in late December, customers whose out-of-warranty Meta Quest 2 headsets were bricked by the software update were asked to pay $150 to receive a refurbished headset. Meta seems to have resolved the situation for most folks, although some customers are still reporting troubles getting a replacement.</p><p>Based on publicly available data <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=meta+quest+3&crid=1XGWPUT0MXIWH&sprefix=meta+quest+3%2Caps%2C97&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">via Amazon</a>, Meta sold three times as many Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S headsets as Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S combined. We don't yet know how widespread the update issue is but we do know that Meta <em>always</em> rolls out updates and features slowly to its headsets to prevent widespread issues like this.</p><p>Given how well Meta's Quest headsets performed this holiday season, there's a possibility that a large number of customers have been affected. If you have been affected, Meta is encouraging users to go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/bg-p/AnnouncementsBlog">this Meta Quest announcement page</a>, tap the options button in the top right, and then click subscribe. You'll need a Meta Quest forum account to do this, but creating one is free and as simple as logging in with your existing Meta account.</p>

<ul><li>Apple is seeking to defend its deal with Google, which provides revenue sharing through Search.</li><li>This comes after the DOJ threatened to break up Google's business after a court found that it holds an illegal monopoly.</li><li>Google has since proposed its own remedies to satisfy the court, arguing that its extreme measures could result in a worse product for consumers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's recent legal troubles have taken an interesting turn, as Apple has made a motion to participate in an upcoming hearing to defend the company and their joint Search deal (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-seeks-defend-googles-billion-dollar-payments-search-case-2024-12-24/">Reuters</a>). This follows a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">proposal by the DOJ</a> to break up Google's business by potentially selling Chrome and prohibiting search distribution agreements with companies like Apple.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgvoalybovd/apple%20declaration.pdf">Apple's declaration</a> explains why its deal with Google is beneficial to both companies and that the DOJ's proposed remedies to prevent such a deal would do more harm than good. Apple states that setting Google Search as the default search engine on Safari provides a better experience for users and that removing it would "hamstring Apple's ability to continue delivering products that best serve its users' needs," adding that its customers "prefer Google."</p><p>Apple receives billions from Google per year through the ad-sharing deal ($20 billion in 2022). The company argues that prohibiting such a deal would either give Google free access to its customers' data or Apple would have to remove Search as the default engine on its browser, which it says would provide a potentially worse experience for its users.</p><p>Cupertino also argues that the DOJ's proposed remedy assumed that Apple is even interested in developing its own search engine, which it says it's not. According to Apple, doing so would take considerable time, money, and resources for something that isn't part of Apple's core business.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/apple-moves-to-fight-us-effort-to-upend-search-deals-with-google">Bloomberg</a>, a hearing for proposals is set to happen in April.</p><p>Following the ruling earlier this year that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">Google holds an illegal search monopoly</a>, the search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calls-out-the-doj-for-its-extreme-plan-to-break-up-its-search-business">lambasted the DOJ's "extreme" proposal</a> while countering with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-files-counter-doj-chrome-proposal">remedies of its own</a>. This includes additional flexibility for partners when choosing default search engines across devices. OEMs would also have flexibility in preloading multiple search engines, which Google says could give "rivals like Microsoft more chances to bid for placement."</p><p>And while Google believes its proposal would address the court's findings, the company still seems reluctant to implement these remedies, as it would "impose burdensome restrictions" on its partners.</p>

<p>You might think it's premature to compare Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS, given that we won't see any Android XR headsets until 2025 at the earliest. But based on everything Google has explained about Android XR's features, hardware, <em>and</em> software, it's remarkable how similar these two operating systems will be.</p><p>Unlike Apple with its productivity-focused Vision Pro, Google and Samsung have said they intend to make gaming a central tenet of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, meaning they'll have to challenge gaming headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>Otherwise, Google's software plans for XR headsets, AR glasses, and smart glasses all directly oppose Meta, the established or aspiring rival in each category. The big question will be whether Google is willing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q2-2024-earnings">lose billions</a> on XR development the way Meta has been or if it'll kill Android XR like so many other initiatives if it's unprofitable.</p><p>We should see a major influx of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> from Google and Meta's partners, running either Android XR or Meta Horizon OS. We'll be following developments closely for both, but if you're weighing buying your next XR purchase for gaming, productivity, or development, this guide will run through what to expect with either operating system.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os-hardware-and-controls-2">Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Hardware and controls</h2>
<p>Meta Quest headsets depend on Snapdragon chips, optimized to run graphics-heavy programs and a dozen sensors or cameras at once. Meta itself said that the Snapdragon XR2 series is "tightly integrated with our software and hardware stacks" and that Horizon OS partners will benefit from their "long-term partnership with Qualcomm."</p><p>Google <em>also</em> "collaborated" directly with Qualcomm when designing Android XR, which is unsurprising given its specialization in the XR space. It specifically declared the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a> as the backbone behind upcoming Android XR headsets. Qualcomm will make its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-spaces">Snapdragon Spaces</a> XR platform fully compatible with Android XR, and they are "focused on helping to build and scale the Android XR ecosystem."</p><p>We expect the performance level for Google and Meta headsets (or their partner brands) to be very similar and dependent upon which generation of Snapdragon SoC they use. The main differences will come down to specific partners' hardware choices, like the cameras, controllers, and amount of RAM.</p>

<p>Based on everything Google has said or shown about Android XR, the operating system can support controller tracking, hand tracking, eye tracking, and voice-controlled commands. So, any given Android XR headset or glasses could ship without controllers and rely solely on pinching and showing information where you're looking; otherwise, they can support proper gaming controllers. It's all up to the OEM.</p><p>Meta supports all of these controller options through the Meta Horizon OS. It hasn't offered eye tracking on a headset since the defunct <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Quest Pro</a>, but we suspect Meta may re-add eye tracking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> since Apple and Google are both making it a point of emphasis.</p><p>There isn't too much else to say about hardware until we try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> or Google's smart glasses for ourselves. Meta's Quest headsets are well known for their strengths — affordability, lightweight and wireless design, reliable tracking — and weaknesses — battery life and the need for comfort upgrades.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="u28GKqQBsoUfoH8M4RUFfK" name="meta-horizon-os-official-concept-work.jpg" alt="An official concept image of a potential Meta Horizon OS VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u28GKqQBsoUfoH8M4RUFfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Concept art of a Meta Horizon OS headset (probably Lenovo's) for productivity work </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta Horizon OS has changed its name a couple of times (starting with Oculus), but it's the proprietary OS behind its Quest headsets. In April 2024, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">opened up Horizon OS</a> to third parties, announcing that Lenovo and ASUS ROG would make a productivity and gaming headset, respectively, with the same OS and software as first-party Quests. Meta also intends to make a Quest "inspired by Xbox" in partnership with Microsoft. We don't know yet when these devices will arrive.</p><p>Based on our demo with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> and our time wearing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, they share many of the same OS tools and AI tricks as the Quest headsets. So, we think it's fair to lump them into the same Meta Horizon OS umbrella.</p><p>While Meta took years to open up its system to others, Google is making Android XR available to other brands from the start without its own (public) hardware plans. Google developed Android XR in tandem with Samsung, which will sell its mixed-reality headset — codenamed Project Moohan — in 2025. Google has its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">smart glasses prototype</a>, but we don't know if they'll ever be available to consumers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Concept render of Samsung's Project Moohan </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also has other partners who plan to sell Android XR devices: Xreal, Sony, and Lynx. Sony already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">announced its mixed-reality headset</a> at CES 2024, and Xreal previously hinted that it intended to make its glasses compatible with a multimodal AI on your phone, meaning Google Gemini.</p><p>Google has explicitly said Android XR will work for AR and smart glasses. Meta announced Horizon OS as "our open mixed reality ecosystem" and did not mention glasses, so it may not intend to share its software with anyone targeting this form factor — or at least not yet.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os-software-games-and-apps-2">Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Software, games, and apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VimKDKShuDZe9icGaoqDRT" name="Meta-Quest-3S-mixed-reality-gameplay-starship-home.jpg" alt="Viewing my living room in mixed reality as a starship in Starship Home through the lenses of a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VimKDKShuDZe9icGaoqDRT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta regularly updates its devices with new software features, but it does so by device: the Meta Quest is on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/whats-new/release-notes">v72</a> as of December 2024, while the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/smart-glasses/articles/release-notes/smart-glasses-release-notes">v11</a>. It's not clear how Meta will handle feature updates for third-party headsets, but it <em>is</em> clear that they update things quickly rather than wait for annual updates.</p><p>It's also fair to point out that Meta's software is highly focused on gaming. It has a few 2D progressive web apps (PWAs) since it can't use traditional App or Play Store apps, but only a few big-name apps like YouTube, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and a few streaming apps with basic VR theater modes. For the most part, you'll be spending your time in the Quest browser.</p><p>On the gaming front, every VR or MR developer focuses on the Quest first and foremost since that's where the money is. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a> list and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a> list should show just how much content there is available — and third-party Meta Horizon OS headsets will get that same content, from virtual experiences to mixed-reality titles that make your living room visible.</p><p>Admittedly, developers are annoyed with Meta at the moment over its mess of an app store, which spends more real estate highlighting the Horizon app over new games. So, if Google provides a better alternative and makes porting games easy, we're sure some developers will jump on board. The question is whether gamers will follow and move over to either Samsung or any other Android XR partner when their current gaming library is on the Quest.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the Android XR front, Google is promising app developers an easy pipeline to their apps appearing on their headsets. It supports "ARCore, Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, Unity, and OpenXR," and there is already substantial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/get-started">documentation</a> for devs to start using the Android XR SDK.</p><p>Google says any current Play Store developer can "opt in" to Android XR and have their app "just work" because of this built-in compatibility. But we assume this would simply mean that the app works as a 2D window in virtual space, not that it'll have any XR optimization. And it's not clear how many major developers <em>will</em> opt into Android XR, based on the difficulties Apple had getting Vision Pro buy-in.</p><p>So far, only a few third-party apps like Adobe, Calm, and MLB have officially signed on. However, even a tiny fraction of the Play Store's app collection would give Google the edge. It also has the advantage of its own apps: being able to include Google Drive and Gmail gives an automatic edge for productivity users. Chrome is a more popular and polished browser option than Meta's, and YouTube and Google TV will provide popular streaming options.</p><p>Plus, Google has the ability to fully sync its Android XR software with your other Android devices, specifically your phone. Just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> benefit from close synchronization for functions like messaging, Android XR headsets and glasses could have functions that Meta can't offer as easily.</p><p>Google has promised full gaming support for Android XR, and many Quest games use OpenXR, allowing for cross-platform compatibility. However, the built-in Quest audience will make it a higher priority for developers, and the specter of Stadia's failure could make gaming developers leery about investing too much time in the platform.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os-gemini-meta-ai-2">Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Gemini & Meta AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="DRPgjWYXCq5R2PqDAfeiqD" name="Glasses_Translate-google-android-xr" alt="Translating a sign using smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DRPgjWYXCq5R2PqDAfeiqD.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An Android XR mock-up of Google Translate on AR glasses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> and Meta AI are two of the most well-known AI options available today. Gemini Live is getting a major marketing push as this conversational tool on your phone, while Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses just got its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">Live AI and live translate</a> update for hands-free Meta AI conversations.</p><p>We can't say whether Gemini or Meta AI is <em>better</em>, but they're both backed by billions of dollars in R&D and teams of engineers, pushing out new, smarter versions at regular intervals. At the moment, both are as prone to hallucinations and misinformation as any other AI.</p><p>In the short term, headsets like Project Moohan and the Quest 3 will <em>offer</em> AI tools, but they won't be the device's focus. Most people are still buying XR headsets for gaming, and you don't need AI for that. It's when we start to see more smart & AR glasses for <em>outdoor</em> use that the AI will really matter, in our opinion.</p><p>Google has said that the "Gemini era" is why Android XR will succeed where past Google VR and AR projects, so whether or not you get invested in the platform may depend on whether you think Gemini will be <em>smart enough</em> to be a real-time multimodal assistant in the next few years.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os-can-google-make-a-name-for-itself-2">Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Can Google make a name for itself?</h2>
<p>Android XR has the potential to become the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">most exciting version of Android in years</a>. However, so much of its potential depends on how well partners like Samsung take advantage of it. Samsung is one of the most popular tech brands in the world, and its hardware and software knowledge helped revive Wear OS from metaphorical life support, but Samsung and Google are both in the business of making money, and XR has historically proven to be difficult to profit from. Just ask Meta!</p><p>We can also look at the example of the Apple Vision Pro, which has a gorgeous design, excellent UI, and opt-in apps from its App Store but has largely failed to make a huge impact. It's in part because of its overpriced headset but also because the audience for a wearable productivity device is relatively small.</p><p>Samsung will have to compete with the established Meta Horizon brand on the gaming front or hope that it can do better than Apple at a lower price point. And if any Android XR brand hopes to sell AR glasses, they'll have to deal with the simple fact that they seem <em>extremely</em> difficult to create in a lightweight, functional form factor.</p><p>All of that is to say; Android XR seems to have some factors stacked against it while also having the advantage over Meta's rival OS in key areas like apps and a full device ecosystem. We're excited to see whether or not Android XR lives long enough to truly make a difference in the XR industry!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-look-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="An angled, rumored rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung doesn't like changing its design, with the last three iterations in this series looking largely identical. If leaked renders are any indication, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a> will have the same design as its predecessor, with boxy sides and a glass back. The design is characterized by a minimal camera module; each individual sensor is housed within a ring, and that's about it.</p><p>This design leads to a cleaner look at the back, and having used devices with overly large camera modules like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, it is refreshing. There isn't much else to talk about in this area; the Galaxy S25 is notable because of its smaller size, with Samsung likely to retain the same dimensions as its predecessor. That should make it good to hold and use, and while we don't have details on color variants just yet, there's a good possibility that Samsung will have at least one new color.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5" name="iphone-16-pro-max-9.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max side view with power button and Camera Control" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the subject of unchanging designs, the iPhone 16 Pro looks identical to its predecessor, which was the same as its predecessor, and so on. Basically, we've had the same design for quite a while now, and if nothing else, it is familiar.</p><p>Also familiar is the camera module at the back; the square housing is distinctive like no other, and even though the design is several years old by this point, it still looks great. The iPhone 16 Pro's flat profile is similar to previous years, but there are slight bevels this time around that make holding and using the phone that much better.</p><p>What's new is the camera control button that's located on the right; while this is an interesting addition, I don't really use it much, and the location makes it awkward to access when using the cameras on the device.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro comes with IP68 ingress protection as standard, and it is the only device that can be submerged in up to six meters of water — all other phones can only be immersed in 1.5 meters. While it's unclear what Samsung will do in this area, it is a good possibility that the Galaxy S25 will also get an IP68, just like its predecessors. Other Android devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and Vivo X200 Pro include IP69 protection as well, but I don't see Samsung going that route just yet.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rLwrTobyNF9sVAt6VC8yDf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-all-colors-01.jpg" alt="All four retail colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLwrTobyNF9sVAt6VC8yDf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung went back to using Exynos designs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a>, but if a recent leak is to be believed, the Galaxy S25 series will once again go back to using Qualcomm exclusively, just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a>, although rumors have been going back and forth on this matter.</p><p>If true, this should give the Galaxy S25 a distinct edge, as Qualcomm is clearly onto a winner this year. By switching to custom cores with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and a node shift to 3nm, Qualcomm is delivering sizeable gains in all key areas, and I'm excited to see how it holds up on the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Of course, this is contingent on Samsung actually using Qualcomm exclusively — we'll only know once the S25 is official. In other areas, the device is likely to be unchanged from its predecessor, but it should hopefully get 12GB of RAM as standard on all models, with Samsung moving away from 8GB base memory (as we've seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>). This is necessitated by all the AI-backed features coming to phones these days, and with Samsung leaning heavily on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, it's understandable that the brand is going with 12GB next year for better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> capabilities.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro has one of the best hardware packages in the industry, and there are no issues in daily use. The A18 Pro continues to deliver incredible performance, and it is particularly great at gaming; it manages to run console-quality games without any lag or jitter, and that's a considerable achievement. While Android hardware is just as good these days, you don't get the same caliber of games as iOS.</p><p>Even with a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro manages to last a day without any issues, but the biggest issue in this area continues to be slow charging tech. It takes over an hour and a half to charge the device, and that's just too long in 2024. In a similar vein, the Galaxy S25 isn't likely to see any advancements in this regard, with Samsung set to use its 25W charging tech.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="jTuL4F5XvGz7EbCj29S7NE" name="S24-Camera.jpg" alt="S24 Camera deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jTuL4F5XvGz7EbCj29S7NE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the one area where there's a considerable difference is the cameras; the iPhone 16 Pro has the same main camera as last year, but you get a new 48MP wide-angle lens, and changes to the tuning means you get much better photos. The ability to change the color balance dynamically gives you significantly greater control in selecting the way resultant shots look, and it transformed how I use the device.</p><p>Samsung is set to change the cameras on the S25, and we might see the same module as the S25 Ultra this time around, which is exciting. Again, we'll have to wait a little while to learn all about the camera tech coming to the device, but given that the S24 and even the S23 didn't offer any meaningful gains, we're due for an upgrade.</p>

<p>While Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">One UI 7</a> is now in the beta phase, the Galaxy S25 will come with the software out of the box. The Android 15-based interface doesn't have many new features, but you get Samsung's usual utilities, and Galaxy AI continues to be the differentiator.</p><p>In a similar vein, iOS 18 doesn't have much in the way of new features either, with Apple Intelligence taking center stage. I think iOS is in need of a visual overhaul, but given its sizeable user base, it's unlikely Apple will make any massive changes to the software design.</p><p>Samsung has a distinct advantage when it comes to updates, with the Galaxy S25 set to offer at least seven guaranteed Android OS updates like its predecessors. The iPhone 16 Pro will pick up six platform updates as standard.</p>

<p>With the Galaxy S25 likely launching in January, you may not have to wait long if you're looking to upgrade your phone. The phone should slot in at the same $899 price point as the S24, and Samsung always has attractive trade-in deals, making it easier to switch to the device.</p><p>The leaks suggest the Galaxy S25 isn't going to differ too much from what we got last year, and that's by design. Samsung is instead positioning its AI software suite and cameras as the main points of differentiation, and that strategy should be unchanged in 2025.</p><p>I'd suggest getting the iPhone 16 Pro if you're interested in seeing what iOS has to offer. The phone has a reliable design, terrific hardware, outstanding cameras, and hassle-free software. The switch to USB-C connectivity makes it easier than ever to switch to the iPhone, and if you're within the Google ecosystem, all your services work just as well on iOS.</p>

AYANEO is one of the companies leading the way in this regard. However, it's taking a slightly different approach by releasing Android handhelds in a variety of form factors, such as the AYANEO Pocket Micro.</p><p>AYANEO attempts to entice those who love devices that invoke some type of nostalgia, with the Pocket Micro looking to cater to multiple factions. The most obvious of which is by making a handheld that draws inspiration from the original NES controller.</p><p>However, what you might not know is that the Pocket Micro's 3.5-inch screen offers a perfect 4x scaling for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-boy-game-boy-advance-emulators-android">Game Boy Advance games</a>. Which is something that's a bit of a rarity in the space. All the while, relying on Android to power the system, which opens the floodgates to a swath of games for you to choose from. And while all of that sounds great, it's important to keep things in perspective and not let the wave of nostalgia tiny your glasses any more than they already might be.</p>

<p>AYANEO announced the Pocket Micro alongside the Pocket DMG all the way back in May with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">pre-orders opening</a> in July. The Pocket Micro was the first to become available, as shipments began in late September in limited quantities before things picked up in October.</p><p>Currently, you can purchase the AYANEO Pocket Micro through the Indiegogo campaign, with a starting price of $189 for the 6GB/128GB model. There's also an 8GB/256GB version available for $229, and a Limited Edition "Retro Gray" variant can be had for $259. We expect the Pocket Micro to soon be made available on the AYANEO website before it comes to other online retailers.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="22fss4KUUE7r7aPgHb9Lz5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro next to LEGO NES Controller playing Super Mario Bros." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/22fss4KUUE7r7aPgHb9Lz5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something that I have to pay attention to whenever I'm interested in getting a new gaming handheld is the ergonomics. I probably have a bit of carpal tunnel, meaning that with some handhelds, I can only play games for <em>maybe</em> 30 minutes before I need to take a break. It varies between handhelds and actually resulted in me investing in a few grips for my Nintendo Switch.</p><p>When I saw that the Pocket Micro was basically a brick, I was pretty worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it. Much to my surprise, that hasn't been too much of an issue, and I can't really seem to figure out why. The flat edges paired with the flat back and smaller size means that I end up holding it differently than other handhelds.</p><p>As a result, the hand and wrist fatigue doesn't actually start settling until I'm about an hour or so into a gaming session. While it's far from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-vs-steam-deck-lcd-what-are-the-differences">Steam Deck OLED</a> or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, the Pocket Micro is more enjoyable to use than I expected.</p>

<p>If there's one thing you should be aware of, it's that this thing is hefty. AYANEO has it listed at 233 grams, which is even heavier than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> (227g), and barely lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (239g). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially when you realize <em>why</em> it's so heavy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="85MTiwnLHijicFFx6Qweo5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-10" alt="Logo and ventilation on back of the AYANEO Pocket Micro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85MTiwnLHijicFFx6Qweo5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's because, in addition to melding glass and aluminum, AYANEO packed Active Cooling into the Pocket Micro. It did so in order to keep both the device and your hands, from getting too warm. With a device this compact, heat dissipation is key because if the heat has nowhere to go, it won't take long for throttling to begin.</p><p>Speaking of performance, it's important to temper your expectations. Unlike the AYANEO Pocket DMG and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>, the Micro is powered by the MediaTek Helio G99 from 2022. I can only assume this chip is at the helm because it's cheaper, which is rather important when you're talking about a premium handheld.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="df6z4cHt2Jtc39BeKa8fv5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-2" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro next to LEGO NES Set playing Super Mario Bros." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/df6z4cHt2Jtc39BeKa8fv5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although it's almost three years old, the Helio G99 has turned into a kind of "old reliable" SoC for various tablets and other devices. That being said, you'll be able to play many, if not all, of your favorite games from the Play Store. In terms of emulation, you'll start hitting the ceiling once you get into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">PS2 and GameCube</a> games.</p><p>Part of that is helped by AYANEO offering configurations with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, but the software also has different performance profiles to help push things further. I couldn't help myself from at least trying to load up some Switch games, unsurprisingly those efforts proved to be fruitless.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-micro-what-i-don-t"><span>AYANEO Pocket Micro: What I don't</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ntxzcqcPAgijX2i8LaAYs5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-16" alt="Close-up of fly-out menu on AYANEO Pocket Micro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntxzcqcPAgijX2i8LaAYs5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a doubt, my biggest irritation with the Pocket Micro was the software experience. Naturally, real estate is at a premium when you have a 3.5-inch screen to work with. But AYANEO's in-house launcher just doesn't cut. Everything is super small, and while I could just adjust the display scaling settings, that's not really something that I want to do.</p><p>Thankfully, there are gaming-focused launchers available, which quickly remedy my issues. Well, at least for the most part. There's nothing I can do to replace the slide-out panel that gives you quick access to various options. But seeing as I don't really mess with those often, it hasn't been much of an issue.</p><p>Instead, I've been bouncing between Emulation Station (ES-DE), Daijisho, and an alpha build of Console Launcher 2.0. If you really wanted to, you could even use something like Nova Launcher or Lawnchair, but where's the fun in that?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1908px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VRsifiwDjYXLBBMc98aZj5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-5" alt="Top-down view of AYANEO Pocket Micro and SMB 25th Anniversary Nintendo DSi XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VRsifiwDjYXLBBMc98aZj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1908" height="1073" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My other issue with the Pocket Micro isn't something that everyone will have to deal with, but it's something to keep in mind. While I commend AYANEO for offering a gaming handheld that's both pocketable and premium, actually playing games might become a problem.</p><p>Although the ergonomics of the Pocket Micro are a bit better than some of the other gaming handhelds, I really do wish I could play for longer than an hour at a time. While I appreciate the nostalgic design, it might have been nice to see AYANEO offer some type of ergonomic grip.</p><p>That's what the company did with the Pocket S, as the "Protective Case" not only keeps the handheld protected but provides a more comfortable experience. Because of that, I've started changing the different positions that I'm holding the Micro, just so that I can keep playing. But ultimately, the best remedy was just to stop playing for a bit until my hands and/or wrists felt better.</p><p>Again, this isn't something that is going to cause issues for some, but it's worth being aware of if you have meaty paws and are considering the Micro.</p>

<p>The world of dedicated Android handhelds continues to expand, and AYANEO is one company that's leading the charge. However, it's not the only option on the block, as there are quite a few Android gaming handhelds to choose from.</p><p>In November, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld">Retroid Pocket 5</a> was released, which is the highly-anticipated successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Retroid-Pocket-Emulators-RP4-Pro/dp/B0CTHDZ57G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HG46S4VOBZVS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HMo8MLny8w-HL2kVjxXcZlm3qUuAL0PTldHfhURT4xRdm9Z81YNBNwW9ZPY2fmgM8SyfWiFy6qiPpJQ2_rKSsCTQM6vUaE-K8jUUkKSGmfAhcKRLhrKwi5jKPsuxhZs_eRFcfx5MaC0feH3Msg4A2tz2VjSDr8fBG6_IGEMlv1X8lrdvynqUqlkCGEca_2o5smhTA4dAqPww8LBPX3nlGXh0QAvzkoBmLE4h1Rszj5h3L_1DLCJwRWqCGNvmARoKHkyfK-TRPPmBnk6mmlNBEe2UgqEPyt-Og3GRfX-JKAuoM33k1txsMm2wog4SNIJ6hWSuzYkED0-WecYRRcVphGOwnw6rw30MVYHPfev0gcvMWvnuF09ifdm1vJHbbEtqGcAcJ_jTRbooGrGBpa_nHO1UXnR4m_pSoQYYRZOYAYxsnZ6B1qtFCoeYMPEeX1hr.0DA-ibrEUsQ4x_MhcQV2qx-7L-QM6xUpUhVgLlLuGVc&dib_tag=se&keywords=retroid%2Bpocket%2B4%2Bpro&qid=1735076654&sprefix=retroid%2Bpocket%2B4%2Bpro%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-1&th=1">Retroid Pocket 4 Pro</a> from January 2024. The Pocket 5 features a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, while being powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage.</p><p>Then there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Processor-Emulator-Supports-Bluetooth-Streaming/dp/B0DN1L8LD6/">Anbernic RG406H</a>, which also arrived in November, and is equipped with the Unisoc Tiger T820, along with a smaller 4-inch IPS touchscreen. Anbernic is well-known in the world of retro handhelds, however, the company tends to focus more on Linux-based devices. That being said, the RG406H is an absolute delight to use, as long as you understand that the T820 isn't the most powerful chip.</p><p>If you're looking for a handheld from a company that you recognize, then you'll probably want to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whoa-the-razer-edge-just-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-ever-in-this-last-minute-black-friday-deal">Razer Edge</a>. This was of the first dedicated Android handhelds to be released by a mainstream company, powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1. Although Razer has yet to release a successor, the Edge remains incredibly versatile, and it's regularly on sale for around $215.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an Android handheld that looks like an NES controller with a screen.</li><li>You're a sucker for premium devices.</li><li>You're looking for a way to play retro and modern games on a pocketable device.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget.</li><li>You have concerns about ergonomics.</li><li>You want a handheld that's more powerful.</li></ul>
<p>Frankly, I already have my fair share of Android handhelds, not to mention a variety of foldable phones at my disposal. That being said, there's just something about playing games on the Pocket Micro that sparks a bit of joy every time I pick it up. Sure, it's not as powerful as other devices, but very few of them manage to pair a premium design with a retro aesthetic in the same way.</p><p>At the same time, it's really tough to recommend the Pocket Micro to anyone who isn't a retro gaming enthusiast. The almost-$200 price tag might just be too much for some, especially when more powerful handhelds can be had for around the same price. It's really just a matter of considering the trade-offs when trying to decide between the Pocket Micro and whatever else might be on your radar.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When I wrote a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-chromeos-wishlist-2024">similar piece</a> to this one last year, there was a bit more excitement in the air. Google had just introduced its Chromebook Plus moniker, which has seemingly proven to be a success. But as I reflect on the months past, that sense of excitement has turned into a bit of unease.</p><p>I have a similar feeling when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> but to a lesser extent. With a few exceptions, not really much has changed when looking at the overall landscape. Samsung is still at the top but has seemingly shifted its focus to more budget-friendly solutions. Meanwhile, other tablets were released that are trying to make a dent in an increasingly stagnant market.</p><p>None of this is to say that there's nothing to be excited about, but seeing how everything played out, my expectations have definitely shifted. Even still, there are a few things that I would love to see out of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> and tablets as we get ready to kick off the new year.</p>

<h2 id="more-storage-please-2">More storage please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-16.jpg" alt="Cloud storage settings on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The logical part of my brain understands that not very many people actually care about having different storage options in Chromebooks. Most of the time, you'll be using this while connected to the internet anyway, so you can just rely on Google Drive or another cloud storage solution to store files.</p><p>But when I look at a device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and see that it only has 128GB of non-upgradeable storage, I'm a bit disappointed. Samsung tries to offset storage concerns by including a microSD card slot, but this isn't the case with every Chromebook.</p><p>Frankly, it's just disappointing to see, and it's something that I hope is rectified in some capacity. At this rate, I'd just be happy to see a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review">Framework Laptop Chromebook</a>, which gives me all of the flexibility I could want in a Chromebook.</p>
<h2 id="flagship-arm-chips-2">Flagship ARM chips</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-with-snapdragon-x-elite.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023) with Snapdragon X Elite promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As soon as I heard about Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series of chips, I immediately thought about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-new-wave-of-chromebooks">how great it would be for Chromebooks</a>. For one, there are a few different processors within the series designed to hit various budgets and price points. At the same time, offering a balance of performance and battery life that we still long for with Chromebooks.</p><p>Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed not to see a single Snapdragon X-powered Chromebook announced before the end of the year. I was hoping that we would have at least seen <em>one</em>, even if it was just a teaser ahead of CES 2025. Unfortunately, that hasn't come to fruition, and I've all but given up on the idea of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Chromebook powered by Google's Tensor chip</a>.</p>
<h2 id="smaller-flagship-tablets-2">Smaller flagship tablets</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tSsL2fuZpMoavesmexrEj" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open mirrored on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tSsL2fuZpMoavesmexrEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even if I didn't write about tablets as part of my job, I'd still use them all of the time. It's part of why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> are so important to me since they're basically mini tablets that can be folded in half and stuck in a pocket. Gone are the days of needing JNCO jeans whenever you're heading out and want to bring a tablet with you.</p><p>So when I say that I hope to see more "smaller" flagship tablets, I'm not even talking about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> or RedMagic Nova. I mean even smaller, something around the size of the Nexus 7, if not a little bit larger. OnePlus and RedMagic are filling the void left by Samsung's decision to forgo the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S10. Outside of that, if you want a compact flagship tablet, your best bet is to import something like the Lenovo Legion Y700.</p><p>Imagine having a tablet that you can comfortably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/we-need-smaller-flagship-android-tablets">hold in one hand</a> and use for everything and anything. Yes, Amazon's Fire Tablets still exist, but those are cheap and lack the performance that I'm looking for. What I'd really love to see is Google release a modern version of the Nexus 7, but we all know that won't happen.</p>
<h2 id="google-should-change-its-mind-2">Google should change its mind</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I guess it's only right for me to finish this piece by pleading with Google again. I feel like it's turning into a bit of a habit, as I've pleaded and begged for Google to reverse rumored decisions, only for them to fall on deaf ears. But I digress.</p><p>The first thing that I want Google to change its mind about is exiting the tablet market. Of course, these are just rumors, and nothing has been confirmed, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-2-alleged-changes-upgrades-report">all of the signs point to</a> the Pixel Tablet being a "one-and-done" device. And frankly, that's just downright disappointing.</p><p>Even in its current state, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> is pretty great as long as you understand the limitations up front. For me, the Tablet and Charging Dock have been a staple on my desk, giving me the best smart home controller that I've ever used. No, I'm not here to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">make <em>that </em>argument again</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bdh92q9a3nU3B2szVNj7vD" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-split-screen-2.jpg" alt="Split-screen apps on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bdh92q9a3nU3B2szVNj7vD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All I'm saying is that I want to see Google stick with the tablet, at least for another iteration or two. How can a company expect sales to be great when it takes an odd approach to the release? Everything was (mostly) fine when you could only get the Pixel Tablet with the Charging Speaker Dock. But then, Google changed course and made it so you could buy the Pixel Tablet by itself. Oh, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">that happened</a> a year after the original release.</p><p>It also doesn't help that the Pixel Tablet uses an LCD panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and a processor that can't take full advantage of the new Gemini features that Google is so focused on. If anything, there's an opportunity to give the Pixel Tablet a "glow-up" in the same way that we saw going from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-week-with-the-google-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-supposed-pixel-laptop-2">What about the supposed Pixel Laptop?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP" name="google-pixel-tablet-freeform-windows.jpg" alt="Freeform windows on the Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's one looming question surrounding both Chromebooks and tablets, and that's whether Google is actually planning to release a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/dropping-chromeos-for-android-on-pixel-laptop-doesnt-make-sense">laptop powered by Android</a>. I'm not smart enough to know how this would affect the market, but it would definitely come as quite a shock.</p><p>While some may believe that Google is looking to replace ChromeOS with Android, I'm of the mindset that such a move <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/dropping-chromeos-for-android-on-pixel-laptop-doesnt-make-sense">would be a bad idea</a>. There's too much money involved with Chromebooks and the education segment that I don't think Google would want to jeopardize that.</p><p>That being said, I am curious about how a potential Pixel Laptop would be presented if it actually sees a release. If I'm putting on my tinfoil hat, this could be the reason why Google is rumored to have canned future Pixel Tablets. However, I don't believe that a traditional laptop powered by Android would be logical.</p><p>Although I feel as though the initial rumors were just seeded so Google could flush out some bad apples, my brain keeps telling me that it's possible. Again, not the whole Android replacing ChromeOS, but the idea of a potential Android laptop.</p><p>I'm still not even convinced that this is a "where there's smoke, there's fire" situation. But Google is working towards <em>something</em> different, as evidenced by continued improvements being made to the native Desktop Mode, along with the surprising addition of a Linux terminal app with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-2-is-here-with-our-first-look-at-the-working-linux-terminal-app">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="are-we-in-store-for-a-major-shake-up-in-2025-2">Are we in store for a major shake up in 2025?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-6.jpg" alt="Close up on keyboard and left ports on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, how great it would be to look into a crystal ball and see what things will look like this time next year. Actually, that would kind of suck, at least depending on how things shake out.</p><p>Besides that, I'm really not expecting many drastic or earth-shattering changes to come to either Chromebooks or Android tablets. Even if the rumors the Pixel Laptop are true, I suspect that it won't see the light of day until sometime in 2026. This gives Google plenty of time to improve Android's native Desktop Mode, and implement any other features it might want to include.</p><p>Instead, we'll probably see the same companies release incremental "upgrades" while Google continues to find new ways to entice everyone to use Gemini. We expect to see the "Quick Insert" key make its way onto more Chromebooks, making it so you don't have to manually remap a key, or try to remember the keyboard combination.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Msynp8USt4qpuR962SgJfF" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-14.jpg" alt="Google Gemini app on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Msynp8USt4qpuR962SgJfF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if we started to see Google introduce a dedicated Gemini key for both Chromebooks and tablets. Many of the latest Windows laptops are equipped with a Copilot key, and I suspect Google will follow suit.</p><p>Gemini is continuing to improve, as evidenced by the swath of updates Google rolled out at the end of 2024. But if Google wants to keep up with ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, it needs more ways to get people using Gemini. The addition of a dedicated key would go a long way in trying to do just that, even if it might end up as a controversial decision.</p><p>Who knows — I've been wrong before, and I hope I'm wrong again.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-132">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>One UI 7 is bringing big changes to how you handle notifications, with the latest beta introducing the 'Filter Notifications' feature.</li><li>This feature helps you sort your notifications into two categories: important ones stay at the top, and less urgent ones are tucked below.</li><li>Filtered notifications aren’t deleted, just moved to a section called 'Other Notifications,' which you can access by tapping the 'X more notifications' bubble.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s One UI 7, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, is likely to revamp how you interact with notifications, and the latest beta shows off a new feature that lets you take charge of your alerts and cut through the chaos.</p><p>Reddit user FragmentedChicken (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-7-filter-notifications-3511176/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) uncovered a nifty new feature called Filter Notifications in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second One UI 7 beta</a>, designed to make managing alerts way easier.</p><p>You can find this handy feature in the Settings menu under 'Notifications' and then 'Advanced settings.' It splits your notifications into two categories: important alerts go to the top, while less critical ones are tucked below. It’s a simple way to keep your priorities straight.</p><p>This feature is pretty cool because it gives you a lot of control. You can filter your notifications in three ways. "Old Notifications" hides alerts that are past their prime, usually a few days old. "Background Activities" cuts out notifications from apps running in the background, so you're not bombarded. Finally, "Minimized Notifications" keeps notifications you’ve already hidden from popping back up.</p><p>Notifications marked as 'Old,' from 'Background Activities,' or ones you’ve 'Minimized' are neatly moved to a section called 'Other Notifications.' When enabled, this section shows up as a separate tab below the main notification panel.</p><p>To be clear, filtered notifications aren’t deleted—they’re just tucked away in a small 'X more notifications' bubble at the bottom of the panel. If you want to check them out, just tap it, and they’ll pop up in one tidy list.</p><p>As shown in the screenshots below, when no filters are active, the KDE Connect notification from the background app appears front and center in the main panel. Once you turn on the 'Background Activities' filter, the KDE Connect icon moves to a 'more notifications' bubble. Tapping this bubble brings up all the filtered notifications, showing them in one place.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Smartphones</a> are everywhere, making life easier, but they also bring one major downside—the endless flood of notifications.

It’s a smart way to tidy up your notifications and make everything feel more organized.</p>

<ul><li>A new One UI 7 feature has been discovered, called "Camera Continuity."</li><li>With this feature, you'll be able to take a picture on your Samsung phone and immediately begin working on it from your computer or tablet.</li><li>There are some limitations, such as this feature only being available in Samsung Internet or Samsung Notes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It's been a few weeks since Samsung rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> for the Galaxy S24, and we're still learning about new features. The latest of which aims to provide even deeper integration between your Samsung phone, tablet, and laptop.</p><p>This upcoming feature is called "Camera Continuity" and is part of the "Continue on other devices" set of features. According to the screenshot provided by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-7-camera-continuity-3511168/">Android Authority</a>, this feature lets you "Take pictures and scan documents or handwriting on your phone or tablet, then continue working on them on another device such as a tablet or computer."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.20%;"><img id="RkoWERZ2aTzWZnMrfzsZB5" name="camera-continuity-description-one-ui-7-beta-2" alt="Camera Continuity description in One UI 7 Beta 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RkoWERZ2aTzWZnMrfzsZB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">via Android Authority </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this seems to be yet another feature locked to Samsung's Galaxy ecosystem of devices. But the requirements to use Camera Continuity go even further. It's said to only be available when your devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth is turned on, and you are making use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones&ved=2ahUKEwjt37_pvcaKAxUQEVkFHSxSFusQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1fGe9iUCg4bRuMbaC3dbPX">Samsung phones</a>, tablets, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops&ved=2ahUKEwjk3YLwvcaKAxWIEVkFHQKTJN4QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ZtyQjyJS1P7ir0Bx9WtmW">laptops</a>, all of which are signed into the same Samsung account.</p><p>Oh, and on top of all of that, this feature is also expected to be limited to the Samsung Internet and Samsung Notes apps. None of this is all that surprising, given that these are the same types of requirements needed whenever using similar features on Samsung devices.</p><p>If anything, this is another "feather in the cap" for those who enjoy Samsung's ecosystem, and want to see more improvements. At first glance, Camera Continuity might seem a bit redundant, given that your images and files can already sync between devices. However, this could offer a more streamlined approach, as Samsung continues to provide the only true alternative to Apple's ecosystem and feature set.</p><p>While Samsung released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout&ved=2ahUKEwjrlrvbvcaKAxUBD1kFHRCLNNsQFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw26dVWvJjSSPut3ztmAs21z">One UI 7 Beta 2</a> just a little over a week ago, it's still only limited to the Galaxy S24 lineup. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-it-matter-that-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-didnt-get-the-one-ui-7-beta">Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6</a> have been left out of the party so far, and we aren't expecting that to change. That being said, it's probably for the best as this seems to be Samsung's most ambitious update to One UI in years, and there are plenty of bugs still left to squash.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It won't be an exaggeration to say that Gemini is on track to becoming an integral part of the overall Android ecosystem if it's not so already. Packed with a laundry list of features, Google's AI-powered chatbot can summarize long-form textual content, generate images based on the description you provide, have conversations with you, and do a whole lot more.</p><p>That's all well and good, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a> is always learning from the information that is supplied to it. To that end, it saves everything—be it textual or spoken—by default. If you find that to be detrimental to your digital privacy, you'll be glad to know that it's quite easy to remove your activity from Gemini. Read on to find out how to do it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-your-activity-from-gemini-2">How to remove your activity from Gemini</h2>
<p>Gemini saves all of your activity (e.g., textual prompts, spoken commands) to your Google account. As such, you can manage and delete this information through your account's activity settings. However, do note that this is only possible if you have a personal account. On the other hand, <strong>if you use a work or school Google account with Gemini, all of your activity is always saved and can't be deleted</strong>.</p>
<p>1. Go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank"><strong>https://gemini.google.com</strong></a> to launch the Gemini web app. Now, tap the <strong>hamburger icon </strong>on the top left corner to access the <strong>slide-out menu</strong>, and then tap on the <strong>Activity</strong> option.</p><p>2. On the next page, tap the <strong>Delete</strong> button (with the <em>drop-down arrow</em>) under the <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> sub-section.</p><p>3. Finally, choose the time frame for which you want the activity to be deleted. You can pick from <strong>Last hour</strong>, <strong>Last day</strong>, <strong>All time</strong>, or specify a <strong>Custom range</strong>.</p><p>4. You can also remove all activity from a specific day, or even an individual activity. Simply tap the <strong>X</strong> icon corresponding to the day or the activity.</p>

<h2 id="turning-off-activity-from-being-saved-and-changing-auto-deletion-settings-2">Turning off activity from being saved and changing auto-deletion settings</h2>
<p>1. Tap the <strong>Turn off</strong> button (with the <em>drop-down arrow</em>) against the <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> sub-section. You'll now get <strong>two options</strong>: just turn off the activity from being saved or do so along with deleting the existing saved activity. Choose the option that you'd prefer.</p><p>2. To change the auto-deletion settings, tap the arrow against the <strong>Deleting activity older than X months</strong> option. Here, you can <em>specify the time</em> (<strong>3</strong>, <strong>18</strong>, or <strong>36 months</strong>) for which the activity is kept before being automatically deleted. Tap the <strong>Next</strong> button and follow the on-screen instructions. You can also <strong>disable auto-deletion</strong> here.</p>

<p>As we move forward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/2025-the-year-ai-finds-purpose-on-phones-smartwatches-tablets" target="_blank">AI-based chatbots are going to play a pivotal role</a> in shaping our everyday interactions with smart devices. Gemini is already the default virtual assistant for all members of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9</a> series, and there's little to no doubt it's going to come preloaded on almost all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> in the future.</p><p>Gemini's capabilities are bound to get better over time, and that's definitely exciting. However, it's also important to know how it's logging and using all of your data. Thankfully, Google makes it super simple to remove your activity from Gemini, so you're the one in control. Whether you want to delete select activity or all of it, you can do it with little to no effort. You can even have your activity deleted automatically after a specified time period.</p>

<ul><li>A new report suggests Samsung will show off the Galaxy Ring 2 and Galaxy AR glasses at Unpacked.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring 2 is said to offer better health accuracy, AI improvements, and longer battery life.</li><li>Little is still known about the Galaxy AR smart glasses, but are expected to compete with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.</li></ul>
<p>We haven't even finished putting the Christmas presents away, and we're already learning more about Samsung's plans for its first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2025. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241225PD216/samsung-galaxy-ar-smart-glasses-2025.html">DigiTimes</a>, Samsung will also show off the Galaxy Ring 2 and the company's AR smart glasses alongside the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>Samsung is expected to include a smattering of improvements with its second-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>. Some of those improvements are said to include updated sensors "to improve the accuracy of health data measurements," along with "new AI-related features."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvjS6S4572bpPFfsvUvArj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-01.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvjS6S4572bpPFfsvUvArj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In an effort to better compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, Samsung is also rumored to offer two additional ring sizes. Currently, the Galaxy Ring is only available in nine different sizes, ranging from 5 to 13. Meanwhile, sizes for the Oura Ring 4 range from 4 to 15. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-expansion-january-rumors">rumors</a> also suggested that Samsung wouldn't wait until the Ring 2 to start offering more sizes, with a Size 14 and 15 said to become available sometime in January.</p><p>After being released in July, Samsung's first smart ring was met with mixed reviews. Android Central's Nick Sutrich, Senior Content Producer, said in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">review</a> that although the "Galaxy Ring looks like a fantastic first-generation effort...the health tracking features feel amateur by nearly every measure." So if this latest report comes to fruition, it seems that Samsung might have been able to right the ship.</p><p>That's not all Samsung is said to be showing off during Galaxy Unpacked, as we could get our first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped">Galaxy AR Smart Glasses</a>. According to the report, these "resemble conventional eyewear with a weight of approximately 50 grams." With this, Samsung is aiming to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Glasses</a>, which currently dominate this segment of the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fqSRrLBJSDKzUtEA5fPNjT" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Limited-Edition-3" alt="Ray-Ban Meta limited edition transparent smart glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fqSRrLBJSDKzUtEA5fPNjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the only other details provided are that Samsung is working with both Qualcomm and Google on the development. This comes as little surprise given that the Galaxy AR Glasses are said to rely on the AI capabilities of Google Gemini.</p><p>In early December, Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a> with Samsung making the first headset, named Project Moohan. Samsung provided a render of its headset as part of the official Android XR introduction, but it looks more like a traditional VR headset, and is far from what we would call "conventional eyewear."</p><p>Given the increasing number of recent rumors surrounding Galaxy Unpacked, we wouldn't be surprised to see more details leaked ahead of the official announcement. But until then, this gives a bit more to be excited about, besides the unveiling of Samsung's next flagship smartphones.</p>

<ul><li>Popular phone skin-maker Dbrand has started selling skins for the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>With the provided renders, we're able to see the rear camera layout and the flat edges.</li><li>After flattening out the edges on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Galaxy S25 Ultra finishes the job.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Galaxy Unpacked is expected to be less than a month away, meanwhile, more and more details are beginning to surface about the Galaxy S25 series. The most recent one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/galaxy-s25-ultra-skins">comes from Dbrand</a>, which has opened pre-orders for those who want to slap a skin on their new phone when it arrives.</p><p>This is technically the second series of devices that Dbrand has leaked in the past month after the company announced a new case for the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, Dbrand stopped short of showing off the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra from all angles.</p><p>Instead, you can get a general idea of what to expect when going through the Galaxy S25 Skin Customizer tool. This doesn't really reveal much more that we haven't already seen. But what it does do is provide some additional confirmation that Samsung is ditching the rounded frame for good.</p>

<p>This is a trend we've seen across many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, adopting a true rectangular design, or "slab." The writing was on the wall that this same trend would come to Samsung's "Ultra" phone after the edges of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> were flattened a bit. However, these renders show that all three Galaxy S25 will share the same flattened design.</p><p>Besides that, it seems that Samsung won't be making any other changes, at least to the camera arrays. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> and Galaxy S25 Plus will look practically identical, with a trio of vertically-oriented cameras, flanked by an LED flash. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra again features a total of five rear cameras, with the flash sandwiched between the telephoto lens and the Laser AF Sensor.</p><p>There is one notable omission here, as there's no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-to-come-on-january-22-2025-leaked-image-suggests">Galaxy S25 "Slim"</a> listed. This is the fourth S25 model rumored to launch this year, but it remains unclear whether the S25 Slim will debut at Galaxy Unpacked, or if it will arrive at a later date.</p>

<p>It's always possible that Dbrand is just using placeholder renders based on previous device leaks. However, we're less inclined to believe that to be the case given the variety of leaks that we've already seen.</p><p>With that being said, we also don't expect to be the last time we see or hear about the Galaxy S25 lineup. There's still plenty of time between now and Galaxy Unpacked, so if anything, we're likely to learn a lot more about Samsung's next flagship smartphones.</p>
