<h2 id="picking-a-color-and-what-you-need-to-know-2">Picking a color and what you need to know</h2>
<p>There&apos;s one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-8a-packs-just-as-much-ai-punch-as-the-standard-pixel-8">key piece of information to know</a> before settling on a single Google Pixel 8a colorway to buy. The phone comes in two memory variants, 128GB and 256GB. Unfortunately, only one shade comes with 256GB and there&apos;s no microSD slot. This means that anyone who wants more than 128GB of storage will have to purchase the Pixel 8a in Obsidian.</p><p>If you&apos;re happy with 128GB, there&apos;s nothing to worry about. You can choose any of the four hues of the Pixel 8a without worries. For people who prefer muted hues, Obsidian and Porcelain are going to be satisfactory. On the other hand, those who like to make a statement will favor brighter hues like Aloe and Bay. Both the green and blue are cheerful colors. Opt for something that aligns with your personal tastes.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve ordered the color that pleases you, you better move on to crucial accessories for your new Google device. A screen protector is essential, so be sure to grab a sturdy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-screen-protectors">screen guard for your Pixel 8a</a>.

<p>If you wanted a modern flip phone in North America, your only viable option for a while was Samsung with the Galaxy Z Flip line, at least until Motorola&apos;s triumphant return to the foldable space with the Razr Plus and Razr 2023 models. Now, Nubia is entering with its first foldable, the Nubia Flip 5G, challenging Motorola&apos;s take on the affordable foldable.</p><p>Both the Nubia Flip 5G and Motorola Razr 2023 have plenty of similarities but are also different enough that Motorola&apos;s phone could still be considered higher-end than Nubia&apos;s. This is evident by the $699 launch price of the Razr, a $200 premium over the $499 Nubia Flip 5G. That said, nowadays, you can find the Razr 2023 for the same price as the Nubia, which might make your decision a little more difficult (or easier) if you&apos;re looking for an affordable flip phone.</p><p>So, which foldable is worth your money?

<p>Budget phones aren&apos;t really known for having the most premium designs, but these two flip phones sort of flip the script on that narrative. Whether it&apos;s more premium-like materials or a more high-end look, both the Nubia Flip 5G and Razr 2023 offer something that makes you feel like you should&apos;ve paid more for either phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> looks like some amalgamation of a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">TECNO Phantom V Flip</a>. Essentially, if you took Samsung&apos;s already stellar design and slapped the Phantom&apos;s circular camera/cover screen housing. The result is something that looks rather classy and different from most other flip phones, which usually opt for a square cover screen.</p><p>The cover panels are otherwise very flat, as is the frame of the phone, which is very reminiscent of the Galaxy. It&apos;s a stark contrast to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a>, which features a more rounded frame and cover panels that curve slightly into the said frame for a seamless feel.</p><p>But that&apos;s not the only way the Razr 2023 differs from the Nubia Flip. Instead of the typical glass you find on most phones, the Razr has a vegan leather finish that completely covers much of the back panels. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">We&apos;re big fans of the vegan leather</a> on Motorola phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G</a>, even if it can get easily scuffed. It certainly makes me less worried about dropping and cracking it, although there&apos;s still the camera/cover screen housing to worry about.</p>

<p>The Nubia Flip is made of glass, but the company put it through a particular process that gives it a sandy feeling. While I like the frosted, stardust look of the glass, I can&apos;t say I&apos;m a fan of how it feels in my hand. The phone feels incredibly cheap as if it&apos;s really made of plastic, which makes me a bit concerned about the durability of the glass.</p><p>Speaking of durability, the Razr 2023 one-ups the Nubia Flip with an official IP rating of IP52, meaning it can withstand light splashes, rain, and even exposure to dust, the latter of which is still pretty uncommon in foldables.</p><p>The Razr 2023 is a hair thicker, but the curved sides help alleviate that a bit. Meanwhile, the Nubia Flip is wider, which I find I prefer on a phone (I&apos;m not a huge fan of very tall phones). Both also have really sturdy hinges that can hold their positions relatively well.</p><p>These phones are very different in terms of design, so it&apos;s hard to say who wins in this department, but the circular housing may give the Nubia an edge.</p>

<p>Spec-wise, the Nubia Flip and Razr 2023 are very similar. Both are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a>, which is a rather capable midrange chip from 2022. Opening and juggling multiple apps is handled well with the included 8GB of RAM (although the Nubia has a 12GB option), and performance is overall pretty good on both phones. That includes gaming, with graphic-intensive games like Honkai: Star Rail playing well, even with higher settings.</p>

<p>The phone displays are the same size, and while the Nubia Flip 5G has a higher pixel density, the Razr 2023 has a higher refresh rate at 144Hz, meaning content is extra smooth, especially during gaming sessions. Still, the Nubia display is plenty fast at 120Hz and even has an incredibly high PWM rate for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> individuals (Motorola also handles this well with flicker reduction, a feature you can enable when needed).</p><p>One area where the Nubia wins is in storage capacity, as it comes with double the amount found in the Razr 2023. The Nubia also has a slightly larger battery and faster charging than the Razr, but the Razr is no slouch and both phones can get you through much of the day before you need a top-up. You also get wireless charging with the Razr, which is always a handy feature to have.</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, and while that makes more sense for the Razr 2023—a phone that was launched while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> was still rolling out on most phones—the Nubia has less of an excuse since it launched in 2024.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s software is very close to the "stock Android" experience you&apos;ll find on a Pixel phone, save for some differences in customizations and additional (and quite useful) gestures. If you&apos;re a fan of the Pixel UI, then you won&apos;t mind Motorola&apos;s flavor of Android.</p><p>Nubia&apos;s MyOS13 is noticeably different, and not necessarily in a bad way. Visually, it&apos;s very unoffensive, and it sort of reminds me of One UI meets Pixel UI. There is quite a bit of bloatware you have to sift through when you first set the phone up, which is a major negative in 2024, and for some reason, the software doesn&apos;t handle notifications very well, as they often won&apos;t appear until much later or not until I&apos;ll open a particular app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3847px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QNQYXXLABxgWtg8HdPucki" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-review-11.jpg" alt="The Nubia Flip 5G in hand with the quick setting shade pulled down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QNQYXXLABxgWtg8HdPucki.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3847" height="2164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nubia also hasn&apos;t been very forthcoming about software updates. We don&apos;t know how many the phone will get or how often it&apos;ll get them, but at a $499 price point, we don&apos;t imagine it&apos;ll be many. Meanwhile, Motorola has promised three OS upgrades and four years of software updates for the Razr 2023, which is a huge step up for the company. Software updates also come roughly every other month, although we are still waiting on Android 14 and don&apos;t know when that&apos;ll appear.</p>

<p>While phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> have large cover screens that let you use apps and feature a number of panels for quick access to features, this isn&apos;t the case for the Nubia Flip 5G or Razr 2023. Both cover screens are rather small and similarly limited in their usability.</p><p>At 1.43 inches, the Nubia Flip cover screen is the more interesting of the two as it&apos;s a circular display. This makes the cover screen seem larger than the 1.5-inch display on the Razr, but it&apos;s not all that interesting to use. It comes with a handful of panels, including a calendar, daily agenda, pedometer, weather, and camera.</p><p>Unfortunately, they&apos;re not all that useful aside from offering glanceable information and one-touch access to simple phone functions. You can view notifications from the cover screen, but these are equally not as useful as much of what you do on the cover screen requires you to open the phone, even expanding on notifications. Swiping individual notifications or clearing them doesn&apos;t seem to work either, and once again, you are required to open the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zDDXc6fL9X9bRnk82RogxC" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-review-3.jpg" alt="The Nubia Flip 5G cover screen prompting to open the phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zDDXc6fL9X9bRnk82RogxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr 2023 cover screen is a little more useful, but not by much. You still get a handful of panels with quick access to certain functions, much of which are less visual than the Nubia&apos;s cover screen. Still, notifications are handled better, allowing me to swipe them away or clear them with the press of a button. I can also expand notifications so I can see the entire text, which is nice as it lets me better determine if it&apos;s worth opening the phone. The Razr also has limited access to the quick settings panel, which is a nice touch and something you can&apos;t do on the Nubia.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4126px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-15.jpg" alt="A notification on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4126" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both cover screens allow you to take selfies using the main cameras, which is handy. On the Nubia, you can open the camera using the dedicated panel or by double-tapping the power button if you have that gesture enabled (although this doesn&apos;t always work for some reason). When the camera is open, swiping up or down lets you switch between photo, video, and portrait modes. Hitting either volume button takes a photo instantly, or you can tap the screen for a two-second timer.</p><p>The Razr 2023 is similar, but you swipe left or right to access the same modes. The main difference is that the Razr lets you switch between the wide and ultrawide cameras (the latter of which is not present on the Nubia), but tapping the volume button or the screen has the same capture response as the Nubia. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t preview/delete the images afterward on the cover screen like you can on the Nubia.</p><p>Lastly, when taking photos with the phone open, the Nubia lets you use the cover screen as a preview for your subject, something you can&apos;t do on the Razr 2023.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">Flip phones</a> are usually limited in the number of cameras they have, with most featuring only two on the rear. This is the case for both phones here, but the Motorola Razr 2023 has a major leg up here. That&apos;s because Motorola outfitted the phone with a wide and ultrawide setup, meaning you can get a wider shot of your scene with the 13MP camera.</p><p>However, when it comes to photos taken with the primary camera, the 50MP sensor on the Nubia seems to do a better job than the 64MP sensor on the Razr. The colors are just more vibrant, and there&apos;s a bit more contrast, which I like. It makes photos really pop, although it can go a little overboard at times. Meanwhile, photos from the Razr, while bringing in plenty of light for low-light images, can often appear washed out and just overall dull in regular lighting, even if you have the automatic photo enhancement feature turned on. Sometimes, it gets a decent image, but it&apos;s hit or miss.</p>

<p>That said, the Nubia lead sort of ends there, as the 2MP depth sensor doesn&apos;t really help at all. The phone seems to have trouble separating the background from the subject, and you&apos;ll need to play around with it quite a bit to try and achieve the effect you want. The Razr 2023 just gets it without the dedicated depth sensor, although the ultrawide likely plays a part. You also get macro mode, making this secondary sensor much more useful than the Nubia, and you can always edit your images in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> if the output isn&apos;t to your liking.</p><p>Both phones top out at FHD 60fps video, but the Razr 2023 seems to struggle a bit when taking videos, and you&apos;ll notice a number of dropped frames and stuttering, especially when you first start recording. The Nubia seems to handle video capture with aplomb.</p>

<p>Given the Razr 2023 launched at a higher price point, this could have been a pretty easy comparison, but not so much. There are a lot of similarities between these phones, with the main differences being in the design, display specs, and camera setup.</p><p>If you really care about camera quality, then the Nubia might be the option for you, although you&apos;ll have to sacrifice an ultrawide sensor for a rather useless depth sensor. The cover screen is also more visually appealing, but it&apos;s less functional, and you&apos;ll have to deal with a few annoyances when handling notifications. The software update situation is also precarious, especially given that this 2024 phone launched with Android 13.</p><p>The Razr 2023 doesn&apos;t have the best camera, but it&apos;s much more versatile than the Nubia. The cover screen also feels smaller, but it&apos;s less annoying to deal with. It also helps that Motorola seems serious about keeping the phone somewhat up to date, and we at least have a solid software promise.</p><p>So who wins? Well, now that the price of the Razr 2023 has been cut down to match the Nubia Flip 5G, I have to go with Motorola. It&apos;s really the little extras like the unique vegan leather finish, the addition of wireless charging, and the more reliable software that give Motorola an edge here. With the Nubia Flip 5G, the situation feels a lot more like "you get what you paid for."</p>

<p>The new Nubia Flip 5G may be the cheapest flip phone you can buy in the U.S. right now, but that doesn't mean it is a cheap phone. The Snapdragon chip offers plenty of power, the 50MP camera is more than capable, and the cover screen makes it fairly easy to view notifications and other information at a glance.</p></p>

It has considerable upgrades, including a 120Hz OLED panel, larger battery, Tensor G3, and it will get the same seven years of software updates as the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> models.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>But there&apos;s a problem. All the new features come with an inflated price tag, with the Pixel 8a retailing at $499 — $50 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> and $100 more than the Pixel 3a. The Pixel 8a is still a good bargain considering you get most of the same features as the $699 Pixel 8, and if you need a mid-range phone, it is the best overall choice.</p><p>While Google is doing the right things with the Pixel A series, I think it needs to shift its attention to the budget segment. There aren&apos;t as many choices in this category as previous years; other than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30</a>, and a few TCL options, you don&apos;t get much if you&apos;re interested in a sub-$350 phone. Even the Galaxy A35 starts off at $399.</p><p>This isn&apos;t limited to North America either. I&apos;ve always recommended Xiaomi&apos;s Redmi Note series in the past, but the brand decided to move up a segment with recent launches, and the result is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro+</a> now costs the equivalent of $495, a truly ridiculous state of affairs. The only budget-focused model in the series is the standard Redmi Note 13, and that just doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nWZPhBUMpYx79ZArta3CNT" name="nothing-phone-2a-9.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nWZPhBUMpYx79ZArta3CNT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only budget phone that I&apos;d recommend is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>; it has a great design, good internal hardware, and clean software with unique extras. The cameras aren&apos;t as good as the Pixel 7a, but you get two usable lenses — which isn&apos;t the case with most budget options.</p>
<p>Google is seeing a lot of momentum with the Pixel A series, but the only way to truly scale its hardware ambitions is by focusing on the budget segment. That&apos;s the only feasible area where Google can meaningfully grow its business in countries like India. While Google sells its phones in the region, they&apos;re significantly costlier than their rivals — the Pixel 8a starts off at an absurd ₹52,999 ($634), and that effectively kills the phone before it even goes on sale.</p>
<p>Ideally, Google needs to introduce a model in the sub-$350 segment to be able to challenge Samsung and Xiaomi. But it is unlikely the search giant will ever do that; in an interview with Austrian publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000189970/warum-google-keine-billig-smartphones-bauen-will-und-wieso-oesterreich-erst-jetzt-drankommt"><em>Der Standard</em></a>, Google&apos;s Pixel division Nanda Ramachandran confirmed that the brand will not release a budget device, stating "we would have to make too many compromises for that."</p><p>A budget Pixel makes sense in a lot of ways. Google&apos;s camera wizardry combined with its unique software features would make a budget Pixel device stand out considerably, but it&apos;s clear that Google has no intention of taking that route. Google says it wants to be a major hardware player, but it doesn&apos;t have a strategy in place that allows the brand to get there. While Pixels are still terrific devices they continue to be out of reach of buyers interested in affordable phones.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> has lofty goals, aiming to make all sorts of smart home devices and ecosystems play nice with each other. The rollout of Matter has been slow, but the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) that develops the standard continues expanding its reach. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-3-specification-released/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Wednesday, May 8, the CSA released the next version of Matter, known as Matter 1.3. The update adds support for new kinds of devices, such as home appliances and electric vehicle chargers.</p><p>The biggest part of Matter 1.3 is the inclusion of new energy management features. EV chargers will be the first type of device to benefit from Matter 1.3&apos;s new energy management system, but it will likely come to others in the future. The CSA says that Matter 1.3 enables supported accessories to "report actual and estimated measurements, including instantaneous power, voltage, current, and others, in real-time, as well as its energy consumption or generation over time." </p><p>In practice, this will help users charge more efficiently and cheaply. High-energy products, like electric vehicles, can have a big impact on their owner&apos;s energy bill when they are charged at peak usage times. That&apos;s why scheduling EV charging at times when energy usage is typically low can be an excellent cost-saving measure.</p><p>With Matter 1.3, supported EV chargers can be controlled over the internet for uses like manually starting or stopping a charging session. Other uses include adjusting the rate of EV charging and to "specify how many miles of range to be added by a set departure time." </p>

<p>Aside from energy management, the CSA says Matter 1.3 also adds support for water management devices. These include "leak and freeze detectors, rain sensors, and controllable water valves." </p><p>Matter 1.3 opens the door for more smart home appliances to be released with Matter support, building upon existing support for washing machines, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">added with Matter 1.2</a>. Five new appliances are supported: microwaves, ovens, cooktops, vent hoods, and laundry dryers.  </p><p>Finally, the latest release improves integration between Matter-equipped TVs and other devices. For example, you might someday get a push notification on your TV that your laundry has finished drying.</p><p>This all requires widespread adoption of Matter to make a meaningful difference, and that&apos;s supposedly coming. The issue with Matter thus far is the pace at which it is being added to new products and existing software platforms. That will still apply to Matter 1.3 because the release only covers the new specification. No new products are ready to release with Matter 1.3 just yet, and it&apos;ll take time for manufacturers to ship home appliances and EV chargers with Matter support. </p><p>"Looking ahead to the fall release and beyond, we anticipate support for enhancements benefiting all users and devices, including new categories of devices, and enabling users to start, grow, and maintain their secure smart home with smart home-focused networking infrastructure," the CSA said. </p>

<ul><li>Back in April, Google announced that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro would support offline finding. </li><li>Now that the Find My Device is rolling out widely, Google is explaining the feature to users enrolled in the network with a push notification.</li><li>Google says that Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro can report their location to the Find My Device network for "several hours" after it is turned off or the battery dies.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google started rolling out the Find My Device network a month ago, and it included a key feature for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. In an April 8 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google said that these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> would be able to report their location to the Find My Device ecosystem even if their batteries were dead or powered off. Now that the Find My Device network is being widely enabled by Android users, Google is explaining to Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro owners how this new feature works. </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/3265955?#zippy=%2Cstep-find-offline-devices-and-devices-without-power" target="_blank">support document</a>, Google elaborates on how long Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro devices can continue providing location data after they&apos;ve been turned off or the battery has been depleted. "For supported devices, like the Pixel 8 series, if the device runs out of battery or is off, the Find My Device network can still locate the phone for several hours after it’s turned off," the company says.</p><p>Google broadly references the Pixel 8 series in its support document, but it doesn&apos;t indicate whether or not the Pixel 8a will support the feature. In other times Google has referenced this functionality, only the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro were listed as having support. However, it&apos;s possible these documents were published before the Pixel 8a&apos;s announcement, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-8a-find-my-device-network-3441230/">support could come in the future</a>, as noted by Mishaal Rahman.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/08/pixel-8-find-my-device-power/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted the push notification Google is sending out to Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro users. The notification seems to be more informative than anything else, letting users know that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> functionality is available. After all, it won&apos;t be helpful when you need it if you don&apos;t know it&apos;s there. Tapping the <strong>Learn more</strong> button on the push notification will provide more details about offline finding, like Google&apos;s guidance that users should make sure Bluetooth and Location are both enabled before their phone shuts down. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fYbbdUHcevxnfRkZqxndqG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-back-porecelain-10.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fYbbdUHcevxnfRkZqxndqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>If you&apos;ve opted into the Find My Device network, your Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro should report its location automatically when it is powered down or the battery dies. However, that might change if you tweak the default settings. Google provides users with four offline device location settings to choose from: <strong>Off</strong>, <strong>Without network</strong>, <strong>With network in high-traffic areas only </strong>(default), and <strong>With network in all areas</strong>.</p><p>To adjust your choice, open the <strong>settings app </strong>and navigate to <strong>Google</strong> <strong>></strong> <strong>All services ></strong> <strong>Find My Device</strong>. Then, tap <strong>Find your offline devices</strong> and pick one of the above four options. Be sure to note that only the latter two will make your Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro available for offline finding. </p><p>While this feature will only be useful in the first few hours after your smartphone is shut down or dies, it&apos;ll still come in handy. For example, if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one can shut it off and immediately cut location reporting. It&apos;s limited to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro for now, but Google&apos;s wording leaves the door open for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> support in the future. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio has exciting products in a range of categories, but IEMs are still its biggest focus. The brand has several dozen IEMs on sale, including traditional dynamic driver designs, hybrid models that use dynamic and balanced armature (BA) drivers, and tribrid models that include electrostatic drivers in addition to dynamic and BA drivers.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a> is Fiio&apos;s only tribrid IEM as of writing, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FIIO-FX15-Six-Driver-Hybrid-Monitors/dp/B0CF2RN8LP">coming in at $749</a>, it is significantly costlier than the brand&apos;s other offerings — until now. Fiio also makes IEMs that solely use BA drivers, and the FA19 is the latest product in this series. With 10 BA drivers in each earbud and as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-FA19-Audiophile-Earphones-Detachable/dp/B0D2RCKGW7/">asking price of $999 on Amazon</a>, it is also the brand&apos;s costliest IEMs to date. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8VxaFxx5TEnVykNofu8e2X" name="fiio-fa19-4.jpg" alt="Showcasing the design of the Fiio FA19 and bundled cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VxaFxx5TEnVykNofu8e2X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio says that the FA19 isn&apos;t an upgrade to the FA9; instead, it is a ground-up reimagining of the brand&apos;s BA offerings, and it has unique bass-focused drivers that give it a distinct presence in the low-end that isn&apos;t evident in its siblings. The brand collaborated with Knowles — the largest manufacturer of BA drivers — to create a custom driver with a larger vent, delivering better bass.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll get to the sound in a little bit, but before that, let&apos;s talk about the design. Fiio uses 3D printed resin shells for a lot of its products, and that&apos;s no different with the FA19. The resin shells allow the FA19 to be lightweight, and the contoured design means you get a comfortable fit. I used the FA19 for the better part of two weeks now, and I didn&apos;t see any issues with comfort even with extended use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JeNgyEmtsFQkyLvCEsBjeW" name="fiio-fa19-1.jpg" alt="Fiio FA19 IEMs next to cable against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JeNgyEmtsFQkyLvCEsBjeW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The faceplate has a custom design that doesn&apos;t have any similarities to other Fiio IEMs, but I still prefer the frond-style design that&apos;s featured in the FX15. There&apos;s a toggle on the FA19 that lets you switch between mastering and Hi-Fi modes; the mastering mode has a neutral sound and is designed to be used for monitoring, and the latter has an exaggerated bass that sounds terrific.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4X3nXvPDY8Bc5ieWGtxE9Y" name="fiio-fa19-8.jpg" alt="Design of the Fiio FA19 shells with cable next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4X3nXvPDY8Bc5ieWGtxE9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The shells have a see-through design that lets you view the individual drivers and sound tubes that feed the audio to the nozzle. There&apos;s a vent at the back, and it affects noise isolation to a noticeable extent. The IEMs connect via MMCX connectors, and while these tend to be not as easy to use as standard 2-pin connectors, Fiio did a great job in this area, and the bundled tool lets you easily detach the cable.</p>

<p>On that subject, the FA19 has one of the best accessory package in this category. You get a total of 18 pairs of ear tips, including silicone balanced, bass-focused, and vocal tips along with memory foam options. The exhaustive selection means you&apos;re guaranteed to get a great fit, and Fiio also bundles the same HB5 case that you get with the FX15. The leather case that&apos;s exquisite; it is just the right size, and it easily holds the IEMs and the cable.</p>

<p>The cable itself is really good; the 8-strand silver cable has a braided design and a sheath that gives it added resilience, and it has a modular connector that lets you switch between 4.4mm and 3.5mm with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kgVDMWhd4PdsqiiiKpeFhY" name="fiio-fa19-11.jpg" alt="Fiio FA19 with bundled accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgVDMWhd4PdsqiiiKpeFhY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the FA19 houses ten Knowles BA drivers in each earbud; there are four custom bass drivers, two ED mid-range drivers, and four SWFK treble drivers. Fiio uses a negative feedback bass enhancement system that reduces low-frequency sounds to the rear cavity of the earbud, delivering detailed bass. There&apos;s also the brand&apos;s S.Turbo that prevents crossover from the low-frequency to the mids.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BWk3kunj6KDZzA8PKEaTsY" name="fiio-fa19-12.jpg" alt="Fiio FA19 connected to Fiio M23 music player" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BWk3kunj6KDZzA8PKEaTsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to the custom bass driver, Fiio says it collaborated closely with Knowles to optimize the sound of the mid- and high-frequency drivers. The result is a sound signature that&apos;s very different to most BA IEMs; the bass in particular is incredible, with a lot of energy and vibrancy. Toggling the IEMs to Hi-Fi mode kicks things up a notch, with the sub-bass and mid-bass frequencies getting even more pronounced.</p>

<p>The mid-range is clean and detailed, with a forward presentation for the vocals. There&apos;s good instrument separation, terrific dynamics, and from a technical point of view, the FA19 nails the basics. The treble has good range, and there&apos;s no sibilance whatsoever; it&apos;s not as detailed as the FX15, but it comes close.</p>

<p>With a sensitivity of 106dB and 10Ω, it&apos;s effortlessly easy to drive the FA19. I used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19 DAC</a>, M23 audio player, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka13-review">KA13 dongle</a>, and ideally, you&apos;ll need something on the same level as the KA13 to get the most out of the IEMs.</p>

<p>Overall, Fiio did a stellar job with the FA19. The BA IEM segment isn&apos;t as extensive as hybrid options, and by using a vented design along with custom bass drivers, the FA19 manages to deliver detailed bass that&apos;s closer to large dynamic drivers. The soundstage is wide and inviting, and you get a comfortable fit thanks to the generous options in the box. I still prefer the FX15&apos;s sound — particularly with the music I listen to — but the FA19 is a technical powerhouse, and if you IEMs with all-BA drivers, it is a terrific choice.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, have filed a lawsuit challenging a new US law signed by President Biden.</li><li>The law may either force TikTok to separate from ByteDance or ban the app in the US, citing national security concerns.</li><li>TikTok argues that the law targets it unfairly and violates the First Amendment's rules on free speech.</li><li>The company also claims that the requirement for TikTok to be sold is not feasible—commercially, technologically, or legally.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TikTok has been on thin ice since President Joe Biden signed the <em>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</em> in April, but the company is suing to stay afloat.</p><p>CNN <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/tiktok-sues-us-app-ban/index.html" target="_blank">reports</a> that the short-form video platform and its parent company, ByteDance, have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.1208620273.1.pdf" target="_blank">filed a petition</a> to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to challenge the new law that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-ban-just-got-the-houses-nod-and-it-might-be-law-real-soon">forces the app to split from ByteDance or otherwise bans it in the country</a>. TikTok claims the law unfairly targets it and is unconstitutional.</p><p>Last month, as part of an aid package for Ukraine and Israel, President Biden <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law">signed a new law that gives ByteDance nine months to either divest TikTok or shut it down in the US</a> due to national security concerns. However, the complaint claims that the government hasn&apos;t provided proof that the Chinese government has misused TikTok.</p><p>“The statements of congressional committees and individual Members of Congress during the hasty, closed-door legislative process preceding the Act’s enactment confirm that there is at most speculation, not ‘evidence,’ as the First Amendment requires,” the filing states.</p><p>The company adds that the law breaks the rules of free speech in the First Amendment and that it&apos;s impossible to follow anyway. TikTok explains that the requirement for the platform to be sold off is impossible in commercial, technological, and legal terms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RFefyrc78eYzo2G8MFgNuY" name="TikTok-icon.jpg" alt="TikTok icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RFefyrc78eYzo2G8MFgNuY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TikTok has less than a year from when President Biden signed the act to find a US buyer or risk being shut down.</p><p>But even if ByteDance were open to selling TikTok, the Chinese government would likely prevent the sale, as it needs to approve the transfer of TikTok&apos;s algorithms. TikTok also mentions that a sale would be tricky, explaining that "millions of lines of software code" would need to be transferred to a new owner.</p><p>When the U.S. government first tried to ban TikTok during the Trump administration, ByteDance looked into selling its US operations to an American company. However, talks of selling to Oracle, Microsoft, or even Walmart fell through, and apparently, ByteDance isn&apos;t interested in a repeat and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">would rather shut down TikTok in the US</a>.</p><p>This lawsuit is the latest chapter in a years-long drama. The US government keeps saying TikTok&apos;s China ties are a security risk, worried that American user data might be leaked. TikTok denies it all, saying it spent tons of cash to keep the treasure trove of data safe.</p>

And while it teams up with plenty of other brands to design eye-catching products — such as the Playdate handheld console — its main focus is music production gear.</p><p>I&apos;ve always been a fan of Teenage Engineering&apos;s Pocket Operator series of miniature synths, and a decade after its launch, the OP-1 continues to be a standout synth. The brand rolled out its field system at the start of last year, introducing a range of devices that are designed for portable use. The CM-15 is a part of that range, which includes a field recorder, mixer, and a lighter OP-1 dubbed the OP-1 Field.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DfEharEJcvgVSdTettfwc5" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-8.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfEharEJcvgVSdTettfwc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea is to be able to create music on the go, and each of the products is designed to work in conjunction with the rest. The CM-15 is particularly notable because of its sheer versatility; you can use it as a traditional studio mic to record vocals or instruments, and there&apos;s the ability to connect it to your phone and use it to record audio — this is handy during interviews — and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mYVpBA722bd7Qt9Ze5B9w4" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-5.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mYVpBA722bd7Qt9Ze5B9w4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the design. Obviously, design isn&apos;t a key consideration when it comes to a mic, but the CM-15 has a minimal aesthetic that differentiates it from other studio mics. The diminutive size makes it a great choice for use on the road; it is about half the size of a phone, and weighs just 132g — no small feat considering it has a built-in battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ly44z6EAg5qpwfuXqrjHo5" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-9.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ly44z6EAg5qpwfuXqrjHo5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, a lot of thought went into the design of the CM-15, and the small form factor combined with the anodized aluminum chassis makes it inherently portable and durable. You also get a decent set of accessories in the box; the bundled adapter allows to mount the CM-15 on a tripod with relative ease, and you get a mini-XLR to XLR along with USB-C to USB-C cables and a field pouch with a water-resistant fabric.</p>

<p>The design feature I like the most is the built-in kickstand at the back; it allows the mic to stay upright on a desk without having to use a mount. Connectivity is via mini-XLR, 3.5mm, and USB-C, and you can power it via 48V phantom power, USB-C, or use the internal battery. It switches between the three automatically, and there&apos;s a tiny LED on the side that serves as a visual indicator for the battery charge level.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kh7EeLAmVXWGbGSXd92tf6" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-14.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kh7EeLAmVXWGbGSXd92tf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Charging the battery takes just over two hours, and you get nearly nine hours of usage between charges — which is more than adequate in this setting.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v9nfRgm3QCjyharkRcToS7" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-12.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9nfRgm3QCjyharkRcToS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than the power button that&apos;s on the left, the only other toggle on the CM-15 is the gain switch; there are three modes available, with the left-most position at 0dB, the middle setting boosting gain by 14dB, and the right-most position increasing it by 32dB.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jZADygZruXnchYVnkLhZ66" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-11.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZADygZruXnchYVnkLhZ66.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the mic itself, the CM-15 includes a 1-inch diaphragm capsule that&apos;s manufactured by Peluso Microphones. The sound quality is fantastic; I normally use a Blue Yeti to record audio and the occasional instrument, and the CM-15 is in another league altogether.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P2QnhqHnDnTFAepC3u5gx6" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-15.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2QnhqHnDnTFAepC3u5gx6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The condenser mic has a unidirectional pattern, so it picks up sounds in front of it, and it does a decent job isolating ambient noise. The best part is the versatility; I used the CM-15 for the better part of four months, and in that time, I recorded interviews on the go, plugged it into my phone to record audio, and while it is vastly overkill for this use case, I attended several dozen briefings and meetings with it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8WpfNoycnmQRQXsvkuYe87" name="teenage-engineering-cm15-16.jpg" alt="Teenage Engineering CM-15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WpfNoycnmQRQXsvkuYe87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is outstanding as a studio mic, and the portability gives it a distinct edge. Coming in at $1,199, the CM-15 is several magnitudes costlier than most products in this category, but if you want a high-quality studio mic with a durable design that can be used anywhere, it is a great choice. </p>

<ul><li>Amazon Ads will roll out three new interactive ads for Amazon Prime video on TVs and other living room devices.</li><li>The company says this will enable users to seamlessly shop during the 15-30-second ad breaks between their shows/movies.</li><li>These ads are said to pop up even when a video is paused and showcase facts about the brand that will help users shop better.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Streaming on Prime Video will get a bit busier as Amazon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-ads-announces-three-new-streaming-tv-ad-formats">announced</a> on Tuesday (May 7) that it will add three new interactive and shoppable ad formats to its streaming platform on living room devices.</p><p>The company said that Prime Video will now receive an expanded suite of interactive and shoppable ad formats, including remote-enabled capabilities for living room devices that go a step ahead of the usual QR code that pops up in an ad.<br>
<br>
Brands will now be able to showcase shoppable carousel ads to help viewers browse and shop multiple product variations on Amazon during ad breaks in Prime Video shows and movies. Brands can also use interactive pause and brand trivia ads in Prime Video TV shows, movies, and live sports. </p><p>These interactive ads are said to appear in three distinctive formats during ad breaks or when the video is paused.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Shoppable carousel ads: </strong>Brands present a sliding lineup of their products that customers can explore on Amazon and add to their cart using most living-room remotes. Viewers can pause these ads to browse through the products.</li><li><strong>Interactive pause ads:</strong> These pop up when viewers pause the show or movie they're streaming. A translucent ad featuring brand messaging and imagery, along with an "Add to Cart" and "Learn More," will create an overlay on the screen, replacing the usual pause screen containing information about the show/movie — these ads will show up even after the ad breaks and disappear when the video is resumed.</li><li><strong>Interactive brand trivia ads: </strong>These Provide facts about a specific brand, giving users the opportunity to shop on Amazon, learn more about services and products, and even unlock rewards. Customers can use their living-room remote to add a product to their cart, request information via email, and claim rewards like Amazon shopping credits with the purchase of eligible items.</li></ul>
<p>Amazon&apos;s research indicated that interactive ads are more effective in boosting engagement rates and driving product sales, allowing viewers to add items to their cart while binging on a show/movie.</p><p>“We are developing innovative experiences to help brands better engage with customers as we work to transform streaming," said Alan Moss, vice president of global ad sales for Amazon Ads.</p><p>"Ads in Prime Video provide an unparalleled experience for advertisers to deliver on any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/what-is-full-funnel-marketing?ref_=a20m_us_blg_nwadfmt_blg_fll_fnnl">full-funnel marketing</a> objective – whether it’s awareness, consideration or conversion,” Moss added.</p><p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted during the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 2024 earnings call</a> that the company&apos;s efforts to bring ads to Prime Video were off to a good start and that advertisers were "excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us [with] video" beyond the previous offerings.</p>

<p>Many people find ads on streaming platforms frustrating, and paying an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-introduces-ads">additional $2.99 </a>on top of their Prime Video or Amazon Prime subscription isn&apos;t something that everyone willingly does to get rid of ads. Instead, viewers painfully wait for the 15-30 sec ads to get done. Imagine an added layer of interactive ads to steer your attention away.</p><p>However, the downside is that Amazon seems to be looking to boost revenue through these new ads, and how viewers will react remains to be seen. Will they really find these ads engaging, or will they become more frustrated and consider switching to an ad-free streaming platform? </p><p>Amazon isn&apos;t the only platform that has introduced interactive ads.
