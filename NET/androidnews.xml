                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It wasn't that long ago that fans of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best folding phones</a> rejoiced that the market finally got competitive. It wasn't just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">Samsung resting on its laurels</a>, making minor changes to the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip lines each year. There were new companies literally entering the fold, like Google and OnePlus. And that's all just North America. Huawei, Vivo, Xiaomi, and TECNO are all doing great things in Europe and Asia.</p><p>Recently, a report from Ma Guangyu at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.163.com/dy/article/JGO5LD4005118HA4.html"> 163.com </a>in China claimed that a major company won't be releasing a large foldable in 2025. While the exact company wasn't named, narrowing down the possibilities isn't difficult. Samsung and Google are obviously going to continue making foldables, and Huawei, Xiaomi, and TECNO are likely to as well. The attention then turns to Vivo, OPPO, and OnePlus by extension.</p><p>OnePlus' first foldable phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, is a big reason why the North American market for foldables quickly became competitive. The word <em>first</em> is a bit of a stretch, though — it's important to remember that the Open is essentially a rebadged version of OPPO's Find N3 foldable.</p><p>OnePlus and OPPO have a complicated corporate structure, but the two companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-announces-deeper-integration-oppo-promises-faster-updates">combined hardware and research teams</a> in 2021 and share a common software codebase. Effectively, the two companies act as one. That's why it's somewhat alarming that neither OPPO nor OnePlus have released a new foldable phone since 2023. (OnePlus' 2024 iteration of the Open, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">Apex Edition</a>, is hardly a new device.)</p>

<p>While Vivo didn't release a small clamshell foldable in 2024, it did release two new large ones. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review" target="_blank">Vivo X Fold3 and X Fold3 Pro </a>debuted this year and were extremely well-received by reviewers, including Android Central's own Harish Jonnalagadda. Meanwhile, OPPO hasn't launched a foldable of any kind since 2023, making it the most likely company to be considering taking the axe to its folding phone business. After all, it already nixed plans to make a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> this year, instead choosing to discount the current OnePlus Open while selling the Apex Edition model at a premium.</p><p>And while reviewers raved about the OnePlus Open (and the OPPO Find N3), that doesn't necessarily mean it sold well. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-foldable-smartphone-market-q1-2024/" target="_blank">report</a> from Counterpoint Research analyzing foldable sales in Q1 2024, shortly after the Open's release in October 2023, revealed that neither OPPO nor OnePlus cracked the top four companies in global foldable shipments. Huawei, Samsung, Honor, and Motorola were all ahead of OPPO and OnePlus.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to OPPO and OnePlus for comment and details on their foldable plans and will update the article when they respond.</p><p>That said, the impact of OnePlus' entrance into the North American foldable market can't be understated. If nothing else, it pushed Google and Samsung to improve their offerings. Samsung made the aspect ratio of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> a bit wider to match consumer trends and the positive reception to the Open's wide cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yYzNtaGkGFXQDTqhP6upzh" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-11.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review cover screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yYzNtaGkGFXQDTqhP6upzh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google arguably took even <em>more</em> inspiration from the OnePlus Open when designing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which feels like a multi-generational leap over the original. The book-style form factor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was ditched completely for a taller aspect ratio that looks eerily similar to the OnePlus Open. Don't believe me? Have a look for yourself:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Lmh82ebQZh4rtj2Qx2MARc" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-oneplus-open-cover-screens.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel Fold, OnePlus Open and Galaxy Z Fold 6 showing cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lmh82ebQZh4rtj2Qx2MARc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: OnePlus Open, Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Galaxy Z Fold 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Often, tech enthusiasts and fans of a particular brand will mistakenly think of copying as a bad thing. That couldn't be further from the truth. As consumers, we <em>want</em> companies to copy each other. If Samsung steals what was great about the OnePlus Open and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the next Galaxy Z Fold device becomes better overall. OnePlus and Google are free to do the same, and so on. Eventually, we're left with a handful of great phones that have all improved due to the strides that each company made individually.</p><p>Time and time again, tech conglomerates have proved that they won't innovate unless their hand is forced. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> are a great example of this, and more specifically, the Galaxy Z Fold line. Samsung didn't begin making major changes to the Galaxy Z Fold until the OnePlus Open and Pixel Fold shook up the North American market. In Asia, the company released its best foldable ever, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> Slim (or the Galaxy W25 in China).</p><p>Why aren't the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim or the Galaxy W25 available outside of Korea and China, respectively? It's hard to know for sure, but I'd wager that it's because the competition is tougher in those markets. Huawei, Vivo, Xiaomi, and TECNO are all making cutting-edge foldables there, and Samsung needed a better option to compete. In the US, Samsung would be happy to sell you the regular Galaxy Z Fold 6 for $1,900.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's still more worth copying. The OnePlus Open introduced an Open Canvas multitasking feature that should quickly become the industry standard, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update">it's now coming to the OnePlus Pad</a>. But if OnePlus never made a foldable, perhaps we'd never see it. In just a few generations, OPPO and OnePlus seriously shook up the folding phone market, even if they didn't sell well.</p><p>We still don't know exactly which major brand could be considering an exit, and the report claims Transsion, the conglomerate that makes budget foldables under the Tecno brand, also ceased foldable development.</p><p>But if the report is accurate, and OnePlus and OPPO end up being the companies that cancel plans for a new foldable, we'll be right back where we started — desperately craving more competition and innovation in this emerging market.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (Nov 14), Google announced that its dedicated "Gemini on iPhone" app is rolling out to Apple's iOS phones.</p><p>According to a press release, Google states iPhone users can begin downloading the new dedicated Gemini app via the App Store. One of the app's standout features is Gemini's image generation capabilities. The post states the AI leverages the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Imagen 3</a> model for "high-quality" and "stunning" imagery.</p><p>Google states the AI's images can be saved and shared with others or used for a project. As a reminder, the company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-image-3-custom-gems-update-detailed">upgraded Gemini's image generation capabilities</a>. The update lets users create "photorealistic" images of animals, objects, plants, and more.</p><p>Speaking of projects, Google highlights Gemini's capabilities to assist students with studying. Users can ask the AI software questions about specific genres and it can also "generate a tailored study plan." Additionally, Gemini on iPhone accepts uploaded "complex diagrams" for quizzing purposes.</p>

<p>For everyday queries, Gemini on iPhone is said to provide a "free-flowing" conversation that feels natural. Google attributes this ability to the inclusion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live</a>. The company detailed this new Gemini variant in August, stating users would find a conversational experience when talking to it. The AI gives users time to brainstorm and ask complex questions about several subjects.</p><p>Google adds that Gemini Live in the new iPhone app lets users practice for interviews and find helpful tips on things to do in an unfamiliar place. Gemini Live contains 10 different voices and supports 12 languages on iPhone. The post states more language support is "coming soon."</p><p>Lastly, Gemini on iPhone brings access to Google's assortment of apps. Through the AI's extensions, users on Apple's smartphones can connect Gemini to their Gmail, Maps, and YouTube accounts. Doing so lets users ask the AI to find a song, a playlist, or summarize the day's emails without diving into those apps themselves.</p><p>Google reiterates that Gemini's dedicated app will be available on the App Store today (Nov 14). However, it seems the exact time "depends on Apple" as some countries may see the app's arrival earlier than others. The app can assist with reminders, schedules, and email composition.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">rolled out Gemini Live</a> for free for all Android users in October. Its initial launch during I/O 2024 concerned Gemini Advanced customers, but now every user can experience its natural conversation experience. That wider launch for Android included even more languages, which can likely be treated as a teaser for what's to come for iPhones.</p>

<p>Wear OS watch brands have gotten the memo: People want their smartwatches to focus on health and fitness as much as smarts and apps. Pixel and Galaxy Watches have become more competitive by copying fitness brands like Garmin (or using tricks acquired from other companies like Fitbit). But they still have a ways to go.</p><p>Before I became the Wearables lead for Android Central, I preferred fitness watches to traditional smartwatches, particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. Now I'm focusing more heavily on Wear OS watches, which have perks Garmin can't offer. However, I also missed a lot of niche fitness tools and longer battery life when I switched to Wear OS — things that both serious athletes and "regular" people pay attention to when they choose their next watch.</p><p>I spoke to my colleagues Derrek Lee, Andrew Myrick, and Jerry Hildenbrand, who have all used both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> and Garmin watches, to figure out what Wear OS should borrow from Garmin to become even better. Here's what we collectively came up with.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-training-courses-2">Dynamic training courses</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M8GG78Yp8tqAc8PNKZzrzi" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-dynamic-routing" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing a 9.7-mile auto-generated course from where the user is standing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8GG78Yp8tqAc8PNKZzrzi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An auto-generated course on the Garmin Fenix 8 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Maps is one of the best tools on Wear OS, especially now that it has offline maps. But what it lacks are offline, downloadable courses for you to generate and follow for runs, hikes, and rides; you can only follow GPX maps using a couple of third-party apps.</p><p>With Garmin, you can download GPX files from apps like Strava to follow, with on-wrist turn-by-turn navigation and upcoming forks on trails. Or, with the "Create Course" tool, you drop a map pin, choose a distance and starting direction, and receive an automatic course that avoids inaccessible roads and uses the "Garmin Connect Trendline Popularity Routing feature to generate a course based on popular routes." Then you send it to your watch.</p><p>I have to assume that Google could offer better routes or heatmaps with its worldwide Maps data for pedestrians, the same way it shows real-time traffic for commuters. Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-ask-google-maps-for-spot-and-activity-ideas-thanks-to-gemini">Google Maps is adding Gemini AI</a>, it should only get smarter over time at figuring out the best routes. I could even envision a Google Courses spin-off app of Maps that lets people create and share their favorite routes, tagging them for good hills or scenery. Then you could download and follow them on your Wear OS watch and compete against other runners' segment times like you can on Strava. Make it happen, Google!</p><p>As a side note, once Wear OS supports proper courses, it should also add the equivalent of Garmin's ClimbPro widget for runners and cyclists, showing the grade, distance, and total number of climbs left for a hard trail.</p>
<h2 id="better-pairing-with-accessories-2">Better pairing with accessories</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jvbWppSQonF5cX6NPKdAuA" name="Polar-H10-and-Coros-heart-rate-monitor.jpeg" alt="The Polar H10 and COROS Heart Rate Monitor straps side-by-side on a shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jvbWppSQonF5cX6NPKdAuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wear OS doesn't play nice with Bluetooth accessories besides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> and a few exercise equipment machines. Any athlete who prefers the accuracy of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">ECG chest strap</a> or an optical armband is out of luck, except for some niche Wear OS apps with the capability; the same goes for niche tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-body-temperature-sensor-thermal-load">temperature sensors</a> or form analysis pods.</p><p>The real problem is for serious cycling or MTB, though. Unlike Garmin, you can't connect your power meters or speed/ cadence sensors to see key data on your watch face during activities. Since these watches have the latest Bluetooth standard, this feels like an overdue no-brainer for Google.</p>
<h2 id="cater-to-more-than-runners-2">Cater to more than runners</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LaWFFCja96ECf6t6Bwb82M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-side-view.jpeg" alt="A close-up view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its Marine band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaWFFCja96ECf6t6Bwb82M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra has the ruggedness for extreme sports, but not the software </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin has specialized software for niche sports, from golf swing coaching and surfing wave tracking to ski maps and oxygen tracking for diving. That's a lot to ask for with standard Wear OS watches, but "premium" watches like the Galaxy Watch Ultra need to grow in these areas to attract superusers.</p><p>My gym-loving coworkers, meanwhile, dislike how basic Wear OS is for strength training. The Galaxy Watch can count reps <em>somewhat</em> decently for a few basic routines, while the Pixel Watch has nothing but calories and time. The newer Garmin watches have great rep-counting accuracy for over 1,000 exercises and even automatically enter rest between sets without input.</p><p>Garmin also shows animated guidance for proper form, muscle maps for each exercise's impact, and a new Garmin Coach plan for strength training on the Fenix 8, giving you weeks of routines that adjust based on your abilities. Wear OS has a lot of room to grow, in other words, and this is a much more common use case that a lot of people would appreciate.</p>
<h2 id="and-yes-make-the-running-even-better-2">And yes, make the running even better</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-and-Android-statue.jpeg" alt="An Android statue wearing a headband and a dummy Pixel Watch 3, standing behind a display of Pixel Watch 3s." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a runner, I was thrilled by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">Pixel Watch 3's running focus</a>, as it added customizable workouts with intervals, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Cardio Load and Target Load</a>, running form analysis, and daily workout recommendations — all in line with Garmin Forerunner tools. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> added dual-band GPS, delivering more accurate tracking almost on par with Garmin's.</p><p>Overall, Wear OS has improved for runners, but there's room to grow. Samsung has yet to offer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> feature, falling behind Google and Apple in guiding runners' long-term progress. And Google's TL tool lacks Garmin's finesse because it doesn't differentiate between low/ high aerobic and anaerobic activities, which is the best way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve your VO2 Max</a>.</p><p>Neither Samsung nor Google offers the running power metric to judge your real-time effort level in tough conditions, a common running watch tool. More specific to Garmin, Wear OS could use some kind of recovery estimate calculator for judging how much rest you need after a workout or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>'s ability to chart your improvement in Endurance or Hill scores over time.</p><p>Most simply, I'd like to see Fitbit and Samsung Health let you track your mileage for shoes and bikes so you know when it's time for a shoe or tire replacement.</p>
<h2 id="copy-garmin-s-wheelchair-mode-2">Copy Garmin's wheelchair mode</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK" name="Garmin_Venu3_push-counting-1.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu 3 push tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Tracking pushes on the Garmin Venu 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My colleague Jerry Hildenbrand wrote last year about why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">Garmin Venu 3's wheelchair mode</a> made a smartwatch more viable for him than other brands. It swaps out "steps" for "pushes," but it's more than that: It focuses on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/health-science/wheelchair-physiology/">"wheelchair physiology"</a> to consider that your reduced muscle mass "restricts the maximum amount of aerobic energy you can produce" and that "upper body exercise typically produces greater physiological strain than lower body exercise at similar workloads."</p><p>Garmin's focus is laudable and rare; most other brands, including the Wear OS ones, have either perfunctory or nonexistent modes for wheelchair-bound folks and will happily encourage everyone to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">stand up and move</a> when some users can't. That's why this Garmin feature is something Wear OS <em>needs</em> to imitate.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end-it-s-all-about-battery-life-2">In the end, it's all about battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Qm3c4DMYtUoCD2tjRSDZgQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-main-watch-face" alt="The default watch face on the Garmin Fenix 8 on the author's wrist.

<p>Google had to invent a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Hybrid Interface</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">make watch faces boringly low-powered</a> just to extend its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> battery life from one to two days, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> lasts three days. Meanwhile, just about any non-Wear OS fitness watch can last a week, and Garmin watches last anywhere from weeks to months with solar recharging.</p><p>These watches use basic, low-powered chips that can't handle speedy apps; Wear OS is too demanding to last long at full power, especially if it starts adding Gemini tricks. So plenty of people pick a cheap, simple watch so they don't have to worry about charging it often, and that's the biggest hurdle Wear OS has to overcome.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">interviewed Qualcomm VP of Wearables Dino Bekis</a>, he acknowledged this, saying the goal is to deliver "a week's worth of battery life," either with RISC-V or custom Oryon cores. I can only assume that Google, their client, is asking for this battery upgrade to compete with fitness watches in terms of their strengths.</p><p>If the hardware can't deliver a battery boost, then Wear OS needs to offer a better Battery Saver mode, like the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a> that extends the lifespan to 45 days per charge — only without disabling all the features that make people want to wear a smartwatch in the first place. Because Garmin watches may not have apps, but they can still last a long time without cutting health tracking and background data.</p>

<ul><li>Google is giving the Pixel 5a one final update, extending its life by three months.</li><li>The Pixel 5a launched in August 2021 with a promise of three years of updates, which wrapped up in August 2024—until now.</li><li>The update, version AP2A.240805.005.S4, seems to be a small bug-fix update with tweaks to adaptive brightness, Bluetooth routing, and the media player.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In an unexpected twist, Google is giving the Pixel 5a a last hurrah with one last update. It appears to be a parting gift for a phone at the end of its software life—a little encore before it bows out for good.</p><p>When the Pixel 5a launched in August 2021, Google promised three years of Android updates and security patches, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-august-2024-update">wrapping up in August 2024</a>. True to its word, Google stuck to the timeline, letting the device phase out quietly without the usual September and October updates.</p><p>Everyone expected Google to end software support for the Pixel 5a after the most recent update, which was par for the course. Surprisingly, though, Google has just rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-pixel-november-update-squashes-the-first-round-of-android-15-bugs">November 2024 security patch</a>, giving the device an unexpected extra three months of life.</p><p>According to multiple reports from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1gqfofx/pixel_5a_got_a_securityos_update_yesterday/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/11/13/pixel-5a-gets-november-patch-reaches-end-of-update-road/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>, the Pixel 5a just received a new security patch labeled version AP2A.240805.005.S4. Google hasn’t explained why it pushed this “post-retirement” update, but it’s a welcome treat for Pixel 5a users.</p><p>That said, this update is a bit confusing. Even though it’s labeled as the November 2024 patch, the security level still shows August 2024 after installation.</p><p>The build number says AP2A.240805.005.S4, dated for November, but without a changelog, it’s unclear if the security patch actually got updated.</p><p>The last Pixel 5a update had the version number AP2A.240805.005, so this new one is probably just a small tweak at most.</p><p>A Reddit user who checked out the update found it includes bug fixes and stability upgrades for adaptive brightness, Bluetooth routing, and the media player.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Google has pushed an update for a Pixel device after its end-of-life.

<p>Google Maps is gearing up for the holidays with new features to save your sanity during travel chaos and those inevitable last-minute gift runs.</p><p>Announced in a blog post today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> is rolling out a feature that lets you hunt down specific items at nearby stores. Just type what you’re looking for into the search bar, and it’ll show you local spots that have it, along with directions for easy pickup. This handy update covers everything from groceries and home goods to electronics and clothing.</p><p>Google also wants to help you tackle winter commutes with a new feature that gives real-time updates on transit delays due to weather. Drawing information from users and local agencies, Maps lets you see issues like unplowed roads, low visibility, or flooding. Plus, you can pitch in by reporting these disruptions.</p>

<p>Maps' new update is also designed to help you beat the winter blues <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-update-automatically-starts-google-maps-navigation">with a little help from Gemini</a>. Just type in something like “fun winter activities in NYC” and let the ideas roll in. Once you find a spot that catches your eye, you can check for perks like free parking and get the lowdown from user reviews summarized with Gemini.</p><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-maps-immersive-view">Immersive View</a> will take your travel game up a notch by giving you a clear picture of your route, so you can check out tricky turns, traffic, and even parking spots before you hit the road.</p>

<p>If you're hauling holiday gifts with a trailer, Maps has you covered. Just input your cargo’s size, and it’ll show you routes that avoid low bridges and tunnels. Right now, this feature works on 2024 Chevy Tahoe, Suburban, and GMC Yukon models, with more vehicles getting it soon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2248px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.47%;"><img id="vPFKoEpHAkPmsvPJCQKMgU" name="Google-Maps-trailering-route" alt="trailering route in google maps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vPFKoEpHAkPmsvPJCQKMgU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2248" height="1112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, EV drivers can now make travel planning a breeze with Maps. Simply use the app on your phone to plan routes with charging stops, then transfer the plan to your car’s built-in Maps. And by adding your vehicle’s make and model, the app will automatically find charging stations that match your car’s plug type.</p><p>To help you beat the holiday traffic, Google is rolling out insights into peak travel trends. By checking traffic patterns, you can find the best times to hit the road and dodge the crowds.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is rolling out a major Fall update for its Google Home platform.</li><li>It includes the integration of Gemini, which aims to make the smart home experience even smarter.</li><li>Users will be able to search the camera history with specific phrases.</li><li>There are a bunch of other updates coming to Google Home later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Back in August, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-to-become-smarter-with-gemini-help#xenforo-comments-1070913">announced</a> new AI-powered developments coming to Google Home to enhance the user experience. The search giant is finally rolling out the integration of Gemini AI into the platform.</p><p>Up until now, Google's Nest Cameras and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> have offered functionalities like the ability to recognize people and their motions next to receiving package notifications. With the latest AI integration, the cameras can now understand and comprehend the context of what's actually happening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.81%;"><img id="ZjebzYHF33Hq2EV2rKQEjD" name="google-home-ai-descriptions" alt="AI descriptions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjebzYHF33Hq2EV2rKQEjD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="578" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Google-Home-Update-Fall-2024-Unlock-a-whole-new-level-of-Google-Home/ba-p/653136"> blog post</a>, Google cites examples like "whether your dog is napping peacefully or digging up your prize-winning petunias." The primary features of the latest development are AI descriptions and search camera history. While the former allows you to add descriptions to your recorded camera clips, the latter will enable you to search the history with phrases like "Did the kids play in the backyard this afternoon?" or "Was a delivery truck here today?"</p><p>These new AI features will first roll out to select Nest Aware Plus users who signed up through the Home app and are part of the Public Preview. For now, they're available in English for U.S. users.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.81%;"><img id="fYCeZdVqWDUrFxZdrd5qiD" name="help-me-create-google-home" alt="Help me create editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fYCeZdVqWDUrFxZdrd5qiD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="578" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's popular script editor for Google Home also integrates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> with a new "Help me create" feature. The aim is to improve home automation skills, making it more accessible. Here are some examples that Google cites that you can create with the upcoming AI feature:</p>
<h2 id="security-2">Security</h2>
<ul><li>Remember to lock up at night</li><li>Make it seem like someone's home</li></ul>
<h2 id="health-and-wellness-2">Health and Wellness</h2>
<ul><li>Help me sleep better</li><li>Set up morning workouts</li></ul>
<h2 id="convenience-at-home-2">Convenience at Home</h2>
<ul><li>Announce dinner time</li></ul>
<h2 id="getting-things-done-2">Getting Things Done</h2>
<ul><li>Remind me to take out the trash</li><li>Help me remember to pick up packages</li></ul>
<p>If you're not sure what automation to set up, Google Home will offer suggestions based on the devices you typically use. This feature will be available to Nest Aware Plus subscribers and is in Public Preview, with plans to roll out later this year.</p><p>The new update also brings a Google Home extension for the Gemini app, letting users control their smart devices directly from the app on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>Pixel Watch owners can also get their Nest Cam and Doorbell feed on their smartwatches, allowing users to talk to people while seeing the live feed on their wrists. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is believed to be the first device to receive this interesting feature.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> owners can now interact with their Nest Doorbell notifications on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>. A new clock, dubbed the dream clock, turns your tablet into a clock when it is sitting idle, and users can choose to see the clock in either digital or analog format.</p><p>The tablet is also gaining a new Home panel screen saver that lets you control smart home devices. With the latest update, a similar home panel is also venturing into Google TVs, which adds the convenience of controlling your smart home without pausing your favorite show or movie.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are new Enhanced overviews on Google TV, including the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, which gives users "full summaries, reviews and season-by-season breakdowns of some of the top movies and TV shows."</p>

<p>The other nifty features coming to the Google Home app include a new favorites widget that gets added to the Home Screen and improved media controls. Together, they should enhance your Google Home app experience.</p><p>As noted, Public Privew-enrolled users will be the first ones to take advantage of the announced features, followed by a much wider rollout.</p>

<p>The year 2024 is nearly coming to a close and it's amazing to see that flagship smartphone launches are still going strong. In an effort to be one of the first out there with the most powerful processor on an Android phone, the OnePlus 13 has already launched in China. The new phone comes with a host of upgrades, built on the strengths of the OnePlus 12. We should expect the global launch to be sometime in January, if not sooner.</p><p>One of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best flagships</a> of 2024 is easily the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. This $1,000+ smartphone is now a bit cheaper than when it launched and should be good competition to the OnePlus 13. It might not look it, but both phones have roughly the same screen size and share many features. If it's the OnePlus 13 vs. Galaxy S24 UItra, which flagship do you choose?</p>

<p>OnePlus is finally breaking away from its typical design language for its flagships and is embracing the flat-frame mania. We now have a flat aluminium frame running along the sides of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, with a 2.5D curve for the back and front panels. We haven't held the phone yet, but it looks like it should be a comfortable fit. There's a new blue colour which looks striking, especially against the silver camera dial. This shade is said to have a vegan-leather back panel. The black variant is supposed to have a wood-grain texture on the glass, while the white has a smooth glass finish.</p><p>Going by the specs of the Chinese model, the blue variant of the OnePlus 13 is 8.9mm thick and weighs 210g, while the glass variants are 8.5mm thick and weigh 213g. Both variants are actually slimmer and lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and match the S24 Ultra in thickness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9qKXtbtAV6H5ijMbkftky9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-all-colors-02.jpg" alt="All four retail colors of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qKXtbtAV6H5ijMbkftky9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is noticeably heavier at 232g, and appears larger due to the almost rectangular design with sharper corners. The display is completely flat though, which some might prefer over a slight curve along the edges. The Ultra is also a bit wider than the OnePlus 13 as it stores the S Pen stylus within the body. The Ultra comes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-galaxy-s24-ultra-should-you-buy">more colors</a> than the 13, including three exclusive shades if you buy it via Samsung's website.</p><p>The S24 Ultra has a distinctive design for sure, and there's no mistaking it for any other phone (other than its predecessor perhaps). Similarly, the OnePlus 13 is unmistakably a OnePlus phone with its massive camera dial on the back.</p><p>Both phones have the same display size. The OnePlus 13 has similar display specs as the 12, which includes a 6.82-inch QHD+ AMOLED display with an adaptive 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate. It has a typical brightness level of 800 nits, but can go up to 4,500 nits (peak). The display can do Dolby Vision HDR playback and is said to be DisplayMate A++ certified. The 13 uses DC dimming at all brightness levels, which should make it more pleasant to view for those who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM flicker-sensitive</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cq3ZabMPTQ7aCcYQuaY9bL" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-vivid-profile.jpg" alt="The vivid color profile on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cq3ZabMPTQ7aCcYQuaY9bL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've said in our review of the S24 Ultra that is has the best display in any Samsung phone to date. The new anti-glare screen coating is a game-changer and it makes a huge difference when using the phone under the sun, outdoors. The 6.82-inch AMOLED panel has 2,600 nits of peak brightness and 120Hz LTPO refresh rate tech. It uses PWM dimming but the rate is high enough to not be an issue if you have sensitivity issues.</p><p>Most flagships in 2024 topped out with an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, the S24 Ultra included. The OnePlus 13 though features a dual IP68/IP69 rating, which helps protect it against jets of water (both hot and cold). This is quite impressive and we should be seeing many more flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo X200 series</a>, also follow suit.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 13 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Google-Circle-to-Search-01.jpg" alt="Using Google Circle to Search on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As of publishing this article, the OnePlus 13 hasn't launched globally yet and is only available in China. We're using the specs of the Chinese variant in this comparison as it should be similar to what we'll get with the global variant too, with the exception of the OS and some storage variants. Doing a direct conversion of the Chinese pricing, the 13 costs roughly $630 for the 12GB/256GB variant. The 12GB and 16GB RAM variants, both with 512GB of storage, cost a converted $688 and $744 respectively. The top-end variant with 24GB RAM and 1TB storage will most likely be a China-exclusive yet again, and this costs roughly $842.</p><p>Considering the global variants have generally cost $100 more than the China pricing, we could be looking at a higher starting price of around $750 or more for the global variant in the U.S.. I'm sure OnePlus will have exchange offers at launch to offset this price increase, so that would be a good time to get the 13 at a cheaper price.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's official starting price is $1,299.99, although you can find it for a bit less in places like Amazon. The 512GB variant costs $1,419.99 and the 1TB variant costs $1,659.99. All variants come with 12GB of RAM. Even with the 13's price increase, it's still going to be cheaper than the S24 Ultra. You'll even be getting plenty more RAM in the higher variants.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of the OnePlus 13 is the new Qualcomm SoC. It's the recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> which promises huge gains across performance, power efficiency, and AI processing. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> is the other phone sporting this new chip, which is slated for a global launch before the year ends. In terms of benchmark numbers and certain real-world usage scenarios, the OnePlus 13 should be able to outperform the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Ultra is no slouch though as the custom 'Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy' SoC it uses can still run laps around even Google's latest Tensor G4 chip when it comes to sustained performance. In our review, the phone didn't break a sweat ploughing through even the most graphically demanding games.</p><p>Battery life is another strong point of the S24 Ultra, as we consistently managed two full days on a single charge even with the brightness set to 100% most of the time. It is highly possible though that the OnePlus 13 could comfortably beat the Ultra's marathon run thanks to its larger 6,000mAh capacity and more efficient 3nm processor. Given the OnePlus 12's amazing battery life, we're sure the 13 is going to be just as great, if not better.</p><p>OnePlus still rules when it comes to charging speeds, and the fact that you get the charger in the box is a massive bonus. The 13 supports 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging. This is miles ahead compared to the paltry 45W wired and 15W wireless for the S24 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW" name="OnePlus-13" alt="OnePlus 13 back camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, the cameras are going to be a major differentiating factor between the OnePlus 13 and Galaxy S24 Ultra. The 13 uses the same 50MP main sensor as the OnePlus 12, but the telephoto and ultrawide cameras also get 50MP sensors. The telephoto still has 3x optical zoom and the same aperture, but with a slightly longer focal length. The ultrawide has a wider field of view, a wider aperture for more light capture, and retains autofocus for macro photography. OnePlus says it has improved the Hassleblad tunning for all its cameras on the 13.</p><p>One feature that the company is highlighting is the phone's incredibly fast shutter speed of 1/10,000 of a second which is supposed to let you capture really fast motion with great clarity. We'll definitely be putting this to the test once we get our hands on the OnePlus 13. This is also one area where Samsung has typically struggled with, capturing fast-moving subjects without blurring.</p><p>Samsung flagships have typically had reliable cameras and apart from the shutter lag issue, all the cameras are highly serviceable. The Ultra model has been known for its incredible zoom performance, and that holds true for the S24 Ultra too. You can go up to 100x with it, although sharpness and details take a massive hit at this extreme. The Ultra even has autofocus for its 12MP selfie camera which should be able to deliver better depth in photos compared to the 13's 32MP camera.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra currently runs One UI 6.1.1 which is based on Android 14. This should soon change early next year when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">One UI 7</a> rolls out, which is based on Android 15. This new version is expected to get a host of new features, including an AI-driven notification summary feature similar to Apple Intelligence on iPhones. We can also expect more Galaxy AI and parental features too, going by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">recent leak</a>. If this is your first time with One UI, then there would be a small learning curve, especially given the amount of gestures, shortcuts, and features that Samsung packs in it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 will ship with OxygenOS 15 which is based on Android 15. If you're curious to know what you can expect, then we're happy to say that it's mostly positive so far. We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">used OxygenOS 15 for a week</a> and came away impressed with some of the new additions, especially the AI features. Tools like AI Unblur, AI Detail Boost, and Reflection Eraser did a good job in our limited testing, and were on par in some cases with Pixel's AI features.</p><p>One thing that remains to be seen is whether OnePlus will match Samsung's seven-year commitment to OS upgrades. The OnePlus 12 is promised four years, so we should expect the 13 to have that too at the very least.</p>

<p>Everything points to the OnePlus 13 being yet another banger of a flagship, and it's priced very well (going by our estimation) compared to the Samsung S24 Ultra. I would recommend the 13 over the Ultra once it launches globally, provided you are okay with paying the full price upfront and don't really need a stylus. Compared to the Ultra, you're getting a more powerful smartphone, better water-proofing, a larger battery and faster charging, the latest software on day one, and some impressive camera capabilities — all for well under $1,000.</p><p>The S24 Ultra will be succeeded by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> in early 2025, which is when it should hopefully get a permanent price cut. It's also more affordable if you buy it via a carrier, as you'll be paying a small monthly fee rather than the full price. Unlike the OnePlus 13, the S24 Ultra should also have better 5G compatibility with U.S. carriers, with support for mmWave 5G.</p>

<p>Even though the OnePlus 13 has yet to be launched in the United States, the dual IP68/IP69 rating is exciting for the Chinese model. Why? Well, the OnePlus 12 variants for the U.S. and China both have an IP65 rating. The OnePlus 13's IP68/IP69 rating for the Chinese model gives U.S. users hope that the U.S. variant will also have that rating.</p><p>The official listing for the U.S. model is unavailable yet, but hopefully, you won't have to wait too long. With that rating, you're looking at a phone with a rating superior to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://proof.vanilla.tools/androidcentral/articles/edit/aBXQefYdivSPLetPsa4CA7" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>An IP68 rating means the OnePlus 13 can be submerged in 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes.  IP stands for ingress protection, a grading system from the International Electrotechnical Commission that certifies how well a device is protected from dust and water.</p><p>The six in the IP68 rating means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is dust-tight and well-protected against dust particles. Six is the highest number you'll see, and zero is the lowest, meaning it has zero dust protection. However, if you see an X instead of a zero, the company did not test the device for dust resistance, but it does not necessarily mean it has none.</p><p>The second number indicates how well a device is protected against water. X means the phone has not been tested, and zero indicates no protection. The highest water resistance number on the scale is 9, which means it can withstand high-pressure water jets and is highly protected against steam cleaning and high-pressure liquids at a close range.</p><p>Despite having an excellent rating, you should be cautious about exposing your phone to harsh chemicals such as cleaning products, sugary drinks, or highly chlorinated pools. If you accidentally spill any harsh chemicals on your phone, immediately rinse it and dry it with a clean microfiber cloth.</p><p>A device with an IP69 rating undergoes additional testing compared to those with an IP68. Additionally, unlike a device with an IP68 rating, it isn't meant for submerging. You might think you could submerge it more with a higher rating, but that is false.</p><p>An IP69 rating is usually found in areas where intense cleaning is standard, such as medical equipment, food processing, and specific industrial settings.</p>
<h2 id="can-the-ip68-ip69-rating-deteriorate-over-time-2">Can the IP68/IP69 rating deteriorate over time?</h2>
<p>Yes! When you take the phone out of the box, it's at its highest level of protection. However, this rating can decrease over time if it is not properly maintained.</p><p>For example, exposing your phone to extreme temperatures or dropping it can damage the seals over time.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The smartphone design pendulum is once again swinging in the direction of ultra-thin devices. The latest rumors indicate that Apple and Samsung are both exploring a premium flagship that prioritizes thinness, and they could debut as part of the iPhone 17 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S25 series</a>. However, for the past decade, phone manufacturers pressed pause on their quest for thinness, instead focusing on things like battery life, camera quality, and performance.</p><p>That's why many iOS and Android fans are probably scoffing at the idea of sacrificing key features in the name of thinness. I don't blame anyone for holding that viewpoint — the last time OEMs tried to make the thinnest phone possible, it didn't end well. Anyone remember the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which were so thin they would literally bend during normal use, resulting in the infamous "bendgate" saga?</p><p>Quite a lot has changed since the iPhone 6 series debuted back in 2014, and a thin phone today doesn't have to come with the same compromises that it did a decade ago. Apple, Google, and Samsung have all released products over the last few months that demonstrate their ability to make thin and capable devices at the same time. If those concepts were applied to the smartphone, I'd snap up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">the rumored Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim</a> in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>I've spent the last few months using three impressively thin devices, and they've convinced me that there's value in thinness. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is 5.1mm "thick" when unfolded, and the 11-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-oled-m4-2024">M4 iPad Pro</a> is 5.3mm thick. These two products have been my go-to foldable and tablet, and their form factors are a big reason why. You don't realize how the heft and thickness of traditional flagship phones affect the way you use them — until you try alternatives.</p><p>So, what's the third device? Ironically, it's the seventh-generation iPod Nano from 2012, measuring 5.4mm. It was the thinnest device Apple ever made until it was usurped by the M4 iPad Pro this year. I've found myself using it again in 2024 as a way to listen to music on runs. It has Bluetooth, is more reliable than a smartwatch for music listening, and is way thinner and lighter than a smartphone. I can't bear the thought of throwing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in my pocket, but the iPod Nano is just fine.</p><p>That anecdote is precisely why the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is appealing. A phone between 5mm and 6mm thick would be thin enough to go places that current flagships can't. To understand why, think about what it's like to hold your phone above your face while lying in bed. Or, consider how tricky it can be to hold a phone, your keys, wallet, or a beverage at the same time. A thin (and hopefully <em>lighter</em>) Galaxy 25 Slim would address all of these (admittedly first-world) problems.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Pixel 9 Pro Fold and M4 iPad Pro are proof that you don't have to make massive compromises to make a thinner device. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold still has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip and solid battery life, and I could say the same about the iPad Pro with its desktop-class M4 system-on-a-chip and 10-hour battery life. Outside of North America, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-might-be-flopping-in-the-us-but-its-special-edition-is-winning-in-korea">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim</a> has a 200MP camera despite being the thinnest Samsung foldable ever.</p><p>There could be more compromises with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Slim</a> since it'll be more compact than both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the M4 iPad Pro. However, early indications are that Samsung might have found a way to include a powerful camera system in a small package. Reliable Samsung leaker IceUniverse on X (formerly Twitter) claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">this model has an "Ultra" camera</a>, perhaps matching the performance of the rest of the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: The Galaxy S25 Slim is equipped with an “Ultra” camera.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854367791438336189">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Even if there are minor hits to battery life and camera quality, I think I can live with that. My screen-on time is above average, usually about 10 hours daily. With intermittent charging at my desk, in the car, and overnight, I easily get through a full day of usage. When I can't, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable chargers and battery banks</a> fill the gap. Now that fast charging is the norm, maybe gigantic batteries and long battery life aren't as crucial as they once were.</p><p>As for camera quality, I think there's value in having large and powerful camera sensors, but it's not necessary. Wearing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> for a year proved that tiny sensors can still be extremely impressive.</p>

<p>Every time I review a smartphone and comment on the device's fit and finish, I'm reminded by readers that most people will never see it. The vast majority of users put a case on their phone on day one, and that's the biggest reason why I'd buy a thin phone. I typically use my phones caseless because I'm not willing to add the extra bulk that comes with using a protective case. However, if the Galaxy S25 Slim shaves a millimeter or two off the phone's thickness, it would benefit case users the most.</p><p>In that scenario, the thickness of a Galaxy S25 Slim with a case installed could match the typical thickness of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> <em>without</em> a case. You could have the best of both worlds — the protection and style points that come with using a case while retaining the typical thinness of a caseless phone.</p><p>This has been the best thing about daily driving the M4 iPad Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The difference of a few millimeters doesn't impact daily use much when using the devices without a case. The last-generation iPad Pro would probably be thin enough for most people, until they try to pair it with a Magic Keyboard. That keyboard case quickly doubles the thickness of the iPad Pro, making it the entire package thicker than a MacBook Air.</p><p>However, pair the M4 iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard, and the entire package feels thinner thanks to the iPad's slimmer form factor. The same goes for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which I use with the Mous Super Thin 2.0 case. I didn't use the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> with a case; the foldable phone became too thick. I'm confident that the Galaxy S25 Slim would bring similar benefits.</p>
<h2 id="a-longer-wait-for-the-thin-phone-of-my-dreams-2">A longer wait for the thin phone of my dreams</h2>
<p>Max Jambor at AllAboutSamsung seems confident that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim does exist. However, it's not likely that we'll see it in January with the rest of the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung could follow a similar timeline to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 series, which started with the regular Fold 6 in July, with the Fold 6 Slim debuting in October.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim exists behind closed doors, but if it’s set to launch at some point, it won’t be released alongside the rest of the S25 lineup. pic.twitter.com/ktinMzERUc<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854564202142183922">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>When (or if) the Galaxy S25 Slim debuts, I'll be ready to open up my wallet — provided it's thin enough. The recent releases of the M4 iPad Pro, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim prove that you can make an excellent device that's impossibly thin. I'm expecting the Galaxy S25 Slim to make waves in the same way those three devices already have.</p>
