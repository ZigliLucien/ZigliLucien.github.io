He looks at things through the eyes of the consumer (being one himself, of course). When Nickolas isn&apos;t hitting a story, he can be found grinding away at a game, reading a book, or scribbling in his journal.</p>

He has been analyzing and writing about the ever-changing world of technology since 2013. Apart from that, Rajat is also obsessed with wrist-worn timepieces, and appreciates a Casio just as much (perhaps even more) as a Jaeger-LeCoultre.</p>

<ul><li>Google has started rolling out its "Collections" tab in Photos, which replaces the old library option.</li><li>The tab swaps the "Photos on device" carousel for a folder and pops in more organization for cloud-stored photos in an "Album."</li><li>This Photos update (once again) shifts the Locked Folder by dropping it down to the bottom of the Collections tab, following user feedback.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The previously discovered "Collections" redesign for Google Photos is rolling out, bringing major changes to how your photos are organized.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/08/google-photos-library-collections-redesign/">9to5Google</a>, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/289829291/introducing-the-collections-view-find-what-you-need-faster">announced</a> its new Collections tab, which lets users "access private and shared albums, all under one roof." Now, Photos offers an Albums folder containing both local and cloud folders of files, personal and shared.</p><p>Users will also find a "Sort by" option in this new Albums folder. The publication found that the old library "Photos on device" carousel has been replaced with a new "On this device" folder.</p><p>Instead of swiping horizontally for memories captured via your camera, apps, or screenshots, "On this device" expands into a grid view of available albums.</p><p>Google added that it wants to "streamline" the way users rediscover their content with this new UI redesign. Collections has Favorites and Trash folders on the top, followed by other themed folders like "People & Pets," "Places," and "Documents." The Photos&apos; Locked Folder will no longer have its pill-shaped button in the open.</p><p>Users can now find their sensitive items listed at the bottom of the Collections page. Lastly, the Search tab has reportedly gained a list view for recent queries and memory suggestions.</p>

<p>The "Suggested" area in the Collections tab drops the Utilities folders. Users will have to search elsewhere for options like "Free up Space," which can be found by tapping their account icon.</p><p>Google Photos&apos; new Collections tab to replace Library is rolling out today (August 8) across Android and iOS. The company states that users should see the update soon, and if not, check back "over the coming weeks."</p><p>What&apos;s interesting about the subtle change to the locked folder in Photos is Google made it a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-now-lets-you-whip-out-your-hidden-pictures-faster"> bit easier to access</a> early in July. The company removed the necessity of digging through your Utilities folder to find your locked contents. After the update, the user could find their locked folder as an option in the suggestion section alongside their favorites and archives.</p><p>However, as the publication notes, it seems this shift (again) with the Collections tab was due to user feedback.</p><p>In other news, we&apos;re still waiting on Google to roll out "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini">Ask Photos</a>" powered by Gemini. The tool will let users find a specific photo in their collection of memories through text-based queries to the AI model.</p>

No trade-in is required, which is an additional bonus if you&apos;re tired of all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">best Galaxy S24 deals</a> requiring that you send in an old phone. </p>

<p>Don't let its small frame and minimalist design fool you: the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> is all power under the hood, from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor to the cutting-edge AI-powered software features. You also get some outstanding camera tech and seven years of OS updates guaranteed, which means you could be using this phone for many years to come. </p>
<p>Pick up a Galaxy S24 from Verizon and add a line with either the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan and the carrier will give you enough promo credits over 36 months to drop the price of the flagship down to zero dollars. No trade-in required!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7fa18990-fe40-4900-92b1-11e5efc42a12" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phones</a> with AI features and an AMOLED 120Hz display; you&apos;re already a Verizon customer or willing to switch.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you like to buy your phones unlocked; you&apos;re hoping to find a trade-in deal. </p><p>Of course, I don&apos;t need to tell you that nothing is <em>truly</em> free when it comes to smartphone deals. Like I mentioned above, you&apos;ll need to add a line with one of Verizon&apos;s unlimited plans to get the promo credit, and those don&apos;t always come cheap. </p><p>If you want the free S24, the best value would be to sign up for the Unlimited Plus plan, which starts at $80 per month for a single line (before any multi-line discounts are applied). That last detail is important, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> are most tempting when you&apos;re adding multiple lines: you can drop the price of the Unlimited Plus plan to just $45 per month when you add four lines, for example. </p><p>The Unlimited Plus plan gives you access to Verizon&apos;s vast 5G Ultra Wideband network with 30GB of premium mobile hotspot data and discounts on home internet. And that&apos;s before you add any of Verizon&apos;s premium add-ons for $10 per month. These optional perks include things like Disney Plus streaming and TravelPass credits, and you&apos;re given the option to mix and match every month without a penalty. </p><p>Needless to say, if you don&apos;t want to change your wireless plan or you prefer buying phones unlocked, skip this deal. But if you&apos;re looking to upgrade anyway and the small-but-mighty Samsung Galaxy S24 seems appealing to you, don&apos;t miss this opportunity from Verizon. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Reports pile up about Russia's apparent throttle of home network speeds for users attempting to access YouTube.</li><li>It seems that speeds drop to around 128Kbps when accessing YouTube, which is not suitable for streaming video.</li><li>Russia and Google have butt heads before, especially when the country blocked Google News for reportedly containing "unreliable" information.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Russian authorities have reportedly crippled YouTube download speeds in the country, forcing a near-complete outage.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/thousands-youtube-outages-reported-russia-2024-08-08/">Reuters</a> first reported the outage, claiming that the country has "stepped up criticism of the platform." It seems that users have been encountering issues with accessing YouTube for the past few weeks. Russia initially blamed Google for the slow speeds, which the company promptly disputed.</p><p>Since the outage, users in the country have been able to access YouTube through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">VPN</a>, but not natively through their internet service provider (ISP). The publication states that its staff in the area can&apos;t access YouTube; however, the service is still accessible on "some" handheld devices.</p><p>Another report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/08/06/russian-authorities-inform-local-internet-service-providers-that-most-youtube-access-is-now-capped-at-a-piddling-128-kbps">Meduza</a> states Russia&apos;s authorities had slowed YouTube&apos;s speeds to 128Kbps (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtube-outage-hits-russia-after-country-throttles-loading-speeds">PCMag</a>). The publication adds that the sheer throttling of network speeds was suitable for listening purposes, but attempting to stream videos was futile. Additional information stems from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/retailrus/14547">Telegram channel</a> that reportedly confirmed that "state authorities" are responsible for YouTube&apos;s crawl and not Google.</p><p>Concern has risen about whether or not the full fleet of Google&apos;s services will meet a similar fate in the future. Even though this isn&apos;t a textbook outage, most users in Russia cannot enjoy YouTube, given the slow home internet speed.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for comment about YouTube&apos;s outage in Russia but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>A YouTube spokesperson provided the following statement to Android Central regarding the issues with YouTube in Russia.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>"We are aware of reports of some people not being able to access YouTube in Russia. That is not as a result of any technical issues on our side or action taken by us."</p><figcaption><cite>YouTube spokesperson</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>Russia and Google have butted heads before, as the country&apos;s officials <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/russia-blocks-google-news-for-allegedly-giving-access-to-unreliable-information">blocked Google News</a> for "unreliable" information reasons. Users in the area lost access to the news aggregate website due to "materials" about Russia&apos;s military conflict with Ukraine. Despite Google&apos;s attempts to keep information freely available to users, the company confirmed that its unavailability wasn&apos;t due to technical problems.</p><p>Other issues include Russia&apos;s ban on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/russia-bans-facebook-from-operating-in-the-country">Facebook and Twitter (now X)</a> alongside reports of officials <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/russia-forces-netflix-to-stream-state-owned-channels">"forcing" Netflix</a> to show specific programming. Reports stated Netflix was required to register to the country&apos;s "audio-visual services," which prompted the necessity of offering 20 state-owned channels. Netflix was also barred from displaying content that included "extremism."</p>

<p>You can purchase the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs directly from Sennheiser for $1,499.98. You can also find it from retailers like B&H Photo and Best Buy, and during the most recent Prime Day sales, it could be found on Amazon for close to $900.</p><p>Matter of fact, if you wait on Amazon, the IE900s have gone on sale a few times, even dropping as low as $999.95 in June of 2023. If I had money just sitting somewhere for a large-ish tech purchase, I’d jump on that immediately, then build a shrine in my home to store them when not in use.</p>

<p>If you couldn’t tell already, I like everything about my experience with the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs. Their chassis is beautifully designed, even though it’s what’s inside that counts. It’s hard to make something so small look “worth” $1,500, but they definitely put their best foot forward as they are beautifully machined and look like art pieces up close.</p><p>There have been times when I’ve reviewed a product and felt like it should’ve come with more accessories in the box for the price it was retailing for. With some premium-priced products, I’ve found myself asking, “Why do I need to buy an additional ______ at x price point?” Not with the IE900s.</p>

<p>In the box, you get 2.5mm/3.5mm/4.4mm para-aramid reinforced gold-plated MMCX cables (Kevlar is a type of para-aramid), a premium hard case, silicone and memory foam ear tips (S, M, L), and cleaning tools. Your bases are covered unless you want to be very particular and look for a 3.5mm-to-1/4-inch adapter.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about the most important aspect: how the IE900s sound. I used them with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">few different mobile DACs</a> and one desktop DAC, as I’ve been testing a few for a roundup. Like a fine wine, IEMs may pair better with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">some DACs than others</a>. My favorite pairings were the iFi GO bar Kensei, iFi GO blu, and Qudelix-5K for its high-quality PEQ.</p><p>Listening to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga (Main Title) from the “Get Out” OST is—at the risk of overusing the word— transcendent. The Ladysmith Black Mombazo acapella intro to “Diamonds” is gleefully airy, while “Sikiliza” is hauntingly ethereal with its heavy, ominous vocals. I can make out the pull and tension of the bow across the strings and the attack with the change in chords and movements as I listen to “Violin Duel” from the Chevalier OST. Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” is a masterclass in engineering, in layering instrumentation in a stereo image, brought fully to life in living color through the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs.</p><p>With its transparent, balanced sound, everything I throw at the IE900s through the iFi GO blu and iFi GO bar Kensei is an absolute delight! That said, audiophiles might tell you that an IEM like this isn’t for bass heads. They’d be wrong. Very, very wrong.</p><p>On its own, the bass produced by the IE900s is well-balanced and tightly controlled but won’t leave your brain rattled. Some of us musical masochists like that, though. Bring on the bass cannon!</p>

<p>With that in mind (pun intended), I plugged the IE900s into the 2.5mm balanced output of the Qudelix-5K, which was connected via USB-C to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 7 Pro.</a> Then, I went to the app’s 10-band parametric EQ, boosting the 36 and 63Hz bands by 5.5dB and achieving bass head Nirvana. I was glowing like Bruce Leroy as I bathed in the tight, soul-stirring bass and sub-bass of Skrillex&apos;s “Mumbai Power” and revisited the swinging upright bass in Mingus’ “Moanin’.” </p><p>As balanced as the IE900 is, the X3R TrueResponse transducer showed no fear when eating the hyped low-end curve I sat in front of it. Unlike some multi-driver IEMs, the IE900 has one dynamic driver that sits inside the X3R triple-chambers milled into the aluminum housings. This technological witchcraft allows the bass to be hyped up to nuclear levels without compromising clarity and detail in the other frequencies.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tbnovdaQenDfANxqLr3hxK" name="sennheiser-ie900-exploded.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE900 IEM exploded view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tbnovdaQenDfANxqLr3hxK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sennheiser)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of frequencies and technical odds and ends, let’s take a moment and talk about what Sennheiser did with their single driver. It’s quite difficult to get balanced sound coming out of one speaker in a pair of IEMs. That’s why other manufacturers will cram multiple units inside those housings; different speakers for highs, lows, etc. But then you’re faced with the problem of having sounds butting up against each other like that, and you run into issues of phase coherence, which in English means two or more sounds running into each other and causing echo or tonal weirdness. That’s a very rudimentary explanation, but I think it gets the point across.</p><p>That said, when you use just one driver, you still run into some issues. To combat the potential for that single driver to have your mids and lows running together and a lack of detail and clarity in the overall sound, their engineers add a small chamber within a chamber inside the IEM housing. Something called a “back volume.” What this does is control the direction and overall volume of air as it moves through the transducer system while killing any fatiguing resonance as sound attempts to bounce around that chamber.</p><p>For those of you into cars and speaker systems, the small chambers of the IEMs are a very technical, precision-crafted “speaker box” of sorts.</p>

<p>There wasn’t anything I didn’t like about the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs (and for $1500, there better not be!), but there is something some users may not care about if they’re primarily using these with a mobile device like a smartphone. There’s no inline mic cable in the box. </p><p>You can pick up a replacement cable specifically for the IE900 that has an inline microphone.</p>
<h2 id="does-anything-else-compare-2">Does anything else compare?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LgcwoBvF6o4iBf7f6XZMXA" name="Shure-SE846.jpg" alt="Shure SE846 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgcwoBvF6o4iBf7f6XZMXA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shure)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At, or around this price point, there are definitely some options for your listening pleasure. With sound being such a highly subjective experience, the issue is going to be deciding which option is best for you!</p><p>Technics EAH-TZ700 are solid performers that are more forgiving with dodgy recordings and lower resolution Spotify streams but less insightful when it comes to great recordings. Then there’s the Campfire Audio Andromeda ‘Emerald Sea’ with its five dual-diaphragm balanced armatures. It competes really well with the IE900, though you may find a bit more detail in the top end of the high frequencies and the lowest end of the low frequencies.</p><p>There’s also the Shure SE846 Gen 2 True Wireless bundle. They’re actually just at $1k but they sound magnificent and come with a bundle that makes them wireless enabled.</p>

<p>I’m completely infatuated with the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs. Their clarity, detail, and ability to eat up EQ like a champion hot dog eater make them a great pair for active recreational listening and for analytical inspection. </p><p>They come with enough extras in the box to cover whatever you decide to hook them up to, and fit shouldn’t be a problem, with enough ear tip options for the most finicky of ear canals. I highly recommend them...if you have the money to spare.</p>

<ul><li>Ayaneo has announced its latest Android handheld, the Pocket EVO. </li><li>The Pocket EVO is the first of its kind to feature an OLED display, while also sporting a 120Hz refresh rate. </li><li>Pre-orders for the Pocket EVO are available now, through Indiegogo, ahead of an official release later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After being teased in early July and introduced a week later, the Ayaneo Pocket EVO is officially available for pre-order. Ayaneo has been on a roll, as the company also recently launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">Pocket DMG and Pocket Micro</a> gaming handhelds. However, the Pocket EVO is entirely different.</p><p>On the surface, it&apos;s not all that different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">Pocket S</a> that was released earlier this year. The Pocket EVO is powered by the same Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 SoC, while also offering another option if you enjoy the horizontal form factor. </p><p>However, Ayaneo is implementing a secret "sauce." Though it&apos;s different from the Pocket S, the Pocket EVO <em>isn&apos;t</em> a brand-new design. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6f7gBShHjRk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Ayaneo has been in the handheld space for a few years now, but the primary focus has been on devices running Windows. Following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">partnership with Qualcomm</a> for the G3x Gen 2, we&apos;ve seen a steady stream of Android devices, culminating with the Pocket EVO. </p><p>However, there&apos;s a bit of cross-pollination taking place, as Ayaneo&apos;s latest device borrows much of its design from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-2s-review-an-impressive-gaming-handheld-with-a-price-thats-hard-to-swallow">Ayaneo 2S</a>. This is a Windows handheld released in May 2023, which offers an alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>What this means for the Pocket EVO is an ergonomic and comfortable design, paired with "x86-level active cooling." Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handhelds</a> tend to rely on passive cooling, which can result in subpar performance if your device gets too hot. By implementing active cooling, performance degradation shouldn&apos;t be an issue, as it&apos;s not like you&apos;ll be able to play more demanding titles like PC games.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2212px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="TuWbi6u9zmYTCVvLgRsFTd" name="ayaneo-pocket-evo-official-lifestyle-logo.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket EVO official render logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TuWbi6u9zmYTCVvLgRsFTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2212" height="1244" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While all of that is great to see, the star of the show is the 7-inch OLED "borderless" display. Surprisingly, there has yet to be a dedicated Android handheld released with an OLED display, but hopefully, this will disrupt the market a bit. The closest that we&apos;ve gotten so far is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini">AYN Odin 2 Mini</a>, which uses a MiniLED display and is two inches smaller than the EVO.</p><p>Ayaneo also points out that along with the 120Hz refresh rate and OLED panel, this handheld also supports HDR and is capable of reaching up to 800 nits of brightness. While that might pale in comparison to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, it&apos;s a big step up from the handheld competition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yf4m7bdEBHUZGao5ws5v2d" name="ayaneo-pocket-evo-official-lifestyle-gameplay.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket EVO gameplay lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yf4m7bdEBHUZGao5ws5v2d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for configurations and availability, there are a total of five different options to choose from. These start with the base model, consisting of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage while maxing out at 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. </p><p>Much like we&apos;ve seen from Ayaneo&apos;s other device launches, you can jump on the pre-order train today by heading over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-evo-world-s-first-7-oled-android-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a>. Early Bird pricing starts at $389 for the 8GB/128GB model, going all the way up to $639 for the 24GB/1TB version. </p><p>However, you might not want to wait too long, as the pricing will jump a bit after the Early Bird units are sold out, and then again when the handheld is released. Speaking of which, there will be a bit of a wait, as the Pocket EVO launch event is scheduled for "the middle of September," with "global shipping" to commence in "Early November."</p>

<p>Samsung is starting to push a monthly security update that its latest flagship owners won&apos;t want to dillydally over.</p><p>A user on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1emcsoz/august_security_update_is_live/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Galaxy S24 Ultra subreddit</a> spotted this month&apos;s patch, which doesn&apos;t include any further One UI upgrades (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/08/galaxy-s24-ultra-august-security-not-one-ui-6-1-1/">9to5Google</a>). Despite the patch arriving at 467MB, the patch notes only mentioned security upgrades and improvements. </p><p>The original poster added that the update was spotted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> on AT&T&apos;s cellular network in central Texas. The update seems to be moving fast as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1emcsoz/comment/lh4aasj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">another user picked it up</a> on T-Mobile&apos;s network using an unlocked device.</p><p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1emcsoz/comment/lh0kxld/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user mentioned</a> why Samsung is urging users to download this update, and that&apos;s because of a CVE-2024-32896 vulnerability. This "major" vulnerability in its Galaxy device software has reportedly impacted its smartphones and tablets. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-s-August-2024-security-patch-will-be-critical-for-Galaxy-devices-company-states.865212.0.html">NotebookCheck</a>, this security flaw also involved Google&apos;s Pixel phones. Specifics regarding the flaw weren&apos;t detailed; however, the publication states it dealt with a "systemic weakness" in Android&apos;s software.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s August update includes fixes that prevent attackers from accessing "protected data," sensitive information, and sensitive information from a Galaxy Watch. As we close the week, other networks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> devices should begin receiving the August patch.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1emcsoz/august_security_update_is_live">August Security Update is Live</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra">r/GalaxyS24Ultra</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>As detailed in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-08-01">Android Security Bulletin</a>, the patch includes 13 "High" severity Framework fixes and one "High" System fix.</p><p>While this August patch does wonders for Galaxy device security, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1emcsoz/comment/lgy00mw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">are still (im)patiently waiting</a> for the S24 Ultra&apos;s camera update.

Unfortunately, the update never arrived and still hasn&apos;t, leaving us to look toward the One UI 6.1.1 update.</p><p>The software update is expected to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">loads of AI</a> to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy devices while also packing major camera improvements. The camera was also said to benefit from a few AI-backed features like Portrait Studio and Sketch to Image. Users can draw images and then lean on AI to turn them into lifelike creations.</p>

If you&apos;re not familiar with the term, esports are video games played in a highly competitive way, often spawning tournaments with televised games similar to traditional sports.</p><p>The idea of having video games at the Olympics—a venue for more traditional sports where players have to be <em>physically</em> athletic—created a very mixed reaction across the world. Esports athletes were thrilled, but there was plenty of concern that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was dumbing down the event in order to appeal to younger audiences. However, I disagree and propose that esports could make it to the actual Olympics if VR games were adopted as the official medium.</p>

<p>Like the Paralympics, the new Olympic Esports Games will be a completely separate event from the main Olympics. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-enters-a-new-era-with-the-creation-of-olympic-esports-games-first-games-in-2025-in-saudi-arabia">The first Olympic Esports Games</a> will be held in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia starting in 2025, with the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Saudi Arabia agreeing to host the event for the next 12 years.</p><p>The IOC hasn&apos;t announced the exact games that&apos;ll be played at the event just yet, but the inaugural <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://olympics.com/en/esports/olympic-esports-series/">Olympic Esports Series 2023</a> featured chess, dancing (via Just Dance), shooting (via Fortnite), racing (via Gran Turismo), and several others.</p><p>We&apos;ve already seen the International Table Tennis Federation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ittf.com/2023/12/07/ittf-announces-vr-table-tennis-world-title-event-in-2024/">adopt VR table tennis</a> as a recognized competitive sport. While it&apos;s a perfect shoo-in for the upcoming Olympic Esports Games, I can think of several examples that would not only fit perfectly in the highly aestheticized proper Olympics but would also make Olympic broadcasting even more interesting.</p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons for the big VR boom during COVID was because of at-home fitness. Apps like Supernatural had people wondering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/supernatural-vr-worth-subscription-cost">if it was worth</a> the $20 per month subscription cost and the obvious answer at the time was yes.</p><p>Supernatural was <strong>the</strong> best way to get a workout at home because it gave you access to real coaches with different workout routines each and every day of the week. It was the gym away from your normal gym.</p><p>But players quickly found out that apps like Beat Saber, which features plenty of similar mechanics to Supernatural, offer on-demand song variety and vigorous, physically demanding gameplay that also gives them a workout.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>SteamVR had to be updated to keep up with Beat Saber players' speed because they were moving faster than originally thought possible.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In fact, just a year prior, Valve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/valve-updated-steamvr-tracking-because-beat-saber-players-were-too-fast/">had to update SteamVR&apos;s movement tracking code</a> because gamers were moving faster while playing Beat Saber than was previously thought physically possible. If that doesn&apos;t scream "Olympic athlete material," I don&apos;t know what does.</p><p>And if the folks who broke those expectations can be found in ordinary homes, imagine what trained Olympic-grade athletes could do? Android Central&apos;s Michael Hicks recently explored the idea of trying to "compete" with Olympics athletes in some track and field events and found the task <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-challenged-olympics-track-and-field-athletes-and-why-you-should-too">to be hilariously impossible</a>.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Some Olympic athletes have been using VR to train for years, giving more credit to the medium's ability to push physical athletics.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You might also be surprised to know that some Olympic athletes have been using VR to train for years. Mikaela Shiffrin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://davidjdeal.medium.com/virtual-reality-helps-u-s-athletes-train-to-win-olympic-gold-bb8c8876449c">trained in VR</a> for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. I spoke with Rolf Illenberger, the founder and CEO of VRdirect, a company that specializes in building VR software for big companies, about the potential of NBC or the IOC to use VR for the upcoming Games.</p><p>"Olympic organizers want to tap into a younger audience," said Illenberger. "Olympic broadcasters want to find new and innovative ways to capture viewers. Olympic athletes want to win medals. It’s not in-your-face from a marketing standpoint, but the Olympic world has begun a full-embrace of VR tools."</p><p>Given that the next Summer Olympics are scheduled to be in Los Angeles in 2028, it seems like the perfect time to showcase America&apos;s leadership in VR in the same state as Silicon Valley.</p>
<h2 id="better-than-real-2">Better than real</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="p69DykYmXkpKtkJnXNTKqi" name="Holopoint-vr-mixed-reality.jpg" alt="A mixed reality screnshot of someone playing Holopoint VR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p69DykYmXkpKtkJnXNTKqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alzan Studios, LLC)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All Olympic sports at games like the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris require years of training, intense effort, and an undeniable set of seemingly superhuman skills in order to compete. As Hicks pointed out in his post, trying to beat even the folks who don&apos;t qualify for the finals is simply impossible for any normal person.</p><p>But there are several sports that just aren&apos;t particularly fun to watch. Archery and shooting events in the Olympics are a great example. The never-ending memes of champion shooters are incredible but watching the actual event on television is rather... dull.</p><p>That&apos;s because the camera angles and the "action" simply don&apos;t translate well. Olympics archers shoot at targets up to 70 meters away (~230ft), aiming for a bullseye that&apos;s a mere 12cm in diameter. That kind of accuracy is pure insanity, but none of it looks particularly "difficult" when watching on TV. All you see is someone holding an arrow for a little while next to a zoomed-in image of the target.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>VR Olympic games could open up a pathway to even more exciting broadcasting.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A lot of this is because of pure physical limitations. You can only use so many cameras for an event of this kind. Targets can&apos;t easily move around or be presented in different ways because any kind of mechanical failure would cause problems for would-be medal winners. I could go on for a while, but I think you understand the point.</p><p>That&apos;s where a VR Olympic archery event could easily differentiate itself from the physical one. Games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/2202354219893697/">Holopoint</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/5951191818246928/">Battle Bows</a> perfectly embody what I imagine a VR Olympic archery event could be. Everyone starts in the center of a dojo and is presented with a set number of targets that move around the arena. Targets are scored based on how long it takes you to hit them and, obviously, how close you get to the center.</p><p>Watching an event like this with virtual cameras would be akin to watching a movie, presenting an archery event that could easily make the primetime segment where events like gymnastics, swimming, and track & field currently dominate. We could get angles impossible for real cameras, the ability to move cameras through space at any angle that makes sense, instant replays from any angle, etc. It&apos;s a director&apos;s dream come true.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mvjRsDu3okpoAmvp3UAoFK" name="battle-bows-vr-official-artwork.jpg" alt="Battle Bows VR official artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvjRsDu3okpoAmvp3UAoFK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Wimo games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>New and unique sports could make debuts at future Olympic Esports events if given the chance.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It could also open up the avenue to new sports or entirely different variations on existing sports. Fencing is a popular Olympic sport and is arguably one of the more exciting ones to watch, even on TV, but VR sword fighting could open that up to entirely different types of weapons. No one wants the Olympics to be a bloodbath, so this would be the only way additional weapons could be a part of the ceremonies.</p><p>This is the ideal way for the Olympics to appeal to the next generation in new and exciting ways, bringing the love of video games and digital media to the historic glory of the Olympic Games. And Illenberger agrees, too. "With LA, the convergence of tech, content and creator will be more emphasized in my opinion," he says. "The market opens itself up for it."</p>

<p>The Pixel 8a is the latest midrange triumph from the bright minds at Google HQ, a phone that packs the powerful Tensor G3 chipset, a 120Hz AMOLED display, and some flagship-quality camera tech into a sub-$500 device. The 8a has only been around since May, but Best Buy is already dropping a straight $100 off the phone when you buy unlocked, or $200 when you activate today, marking the biggest discount that the midrange device has ever received.  <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-8a-5g-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6578506.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ad41dffd-595f-4e45-9167-d301fce1e346" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499" data-dimension48="$499">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>If you need something bigger and with more power than the Pixel 8a, it's worth noting that the Google Pixel 8 Pro is also getting a $300 discount when you buy unlocked at Best Buy. The Pro held the top spot in our list of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> for a long time, and while it's since been replaced, it remains a great choice if you want outstanding cameras, AI-powered software features, and seven years of software support in a device. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-8-pro-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6559251.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d8139e6e-bec4-4e69-9af8-a9fec348a143" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you simply want a great Pixel device with cutting-edge camera tech and years of software support for way less than the retail price.</p><p><strong>❌Skip these deals if: </strong>you like using the latest devices that hit the market; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in deal.</p><p>Google has already confirmed that it will be announcing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a>, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold at the Made by Google event on August 13th, but many folks — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">Android Central included</a> — have been wondering if the new launch is even necessary. After all, early reports indicate that the Tensor G4 chipset will only bring marginal improvements to the new flagship lineup, and while we&apos;re happy to see some upgrades to the cameras, it&apos;s not like the Pixel 8 series was a slouch in that department to start with. </p><p>So if you&apos;re a Google enthusiast and you can get a good deal through your carrier, by all means wait for the Pixel 9 lineup to drop next week, but if you simply want a great phone that will stay supported for many years to come, these Best Buy deals are for you. </p>

<hr>
<p>New messaging standards are the talk of the town, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-should-be-ashamed-rcs-ios">from RCS to iMessage</a>. However, you may know that critical infrastructure still relies on SMS messaging, which is decades old and has many security issues. In fact, SMS and MMS text messages are often used as a fallback when better options, like iMessage or RCS, are unavailable. It’s this reliance on aging and insecure messaging infrastructure that allows bad actors to use it to their advantage, committing text message fraud.</p><p>It’s tough to keep up with all the evolving scams and tricks, and Google published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/" target="_blank">security blog post</a> explaining the latest Android text message scam, which exploits 2G networks. It’s called SMS Blaster Fraud, and it tricks your device into what it thinks is a secure cell tower. Instead, you’re actually connecting to a stranger’s device, which will then be used for a smishing attack (SMS phishing). You could think you’re giving information to a trusted source, but actually end up handing it right over to the bad guys. </p><p>Your cell phone is constantly searching for cell towers to ensure it has a constant and fast network connection. However, it could end up connecting to what is known as a cell-site simulator, False Base Station (FBS) or Stingray. Essentially, these are small radio transmitters that mimic a real cell site. Your phone may connect to them unknowingly, perceiving a cell-site simulator as a true and authentic cell tower. According to Google, cellular carriers have reported more frequent instances of SMS Blaster Fraud in recent years.</p><p>The scam is simple. A false base station is small enough to fit into a backpack, so it’s portable. An attacker could go to a high-density area, where there are sure to be many cell phones around. Then, it creates a false <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/5g">5G</a> or LTE network that is actually a trap for cell phones. When a device connects to the false base station, the connection is really downgraded to a 2G connection, which is woefully insecure. The whole point of this attack is merely to get your phone to ditch its secure 4G LTE or 5G connection for a weak 2G one. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RKyH4NqwfGtrAmkYuQ8knR" name="galaxy-s10-5g-test-wide.jpg" alt="5G test on Verizon mmWave" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RKyH4NqwfGtrAmkYuQ8knR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>2G connections lack mutual authentication and encryption, so someone in the middle of your phone and a fake cell site simulator can “blast” SMS phishing attempts with ease. Additionally, the scammer can alter every field of a message sent using a cell site simulator, making it look authentic. This means that unknowing users — and even those with excellent digital literacy — can fall victim to SMS Blaster Fraud.</p><p>In case that wasn’t enough, there’s another aspect of SMS Blaster Fraud that makes it particularly dangerous. Because your phone is connecting directly to a fake cell tower, there are no protections in place to stop SMS phishing attempts from reaching your device. Typically, carriers have protections and filters in place to root out spam and scams. However, by using SMS Blaster Fraud, fraudsters can take things out of carriers’ hands. </p><p>To make matters worse, the technology needed to exploit these security vulnerabilities is cheap, easily accessible, and requires little to no expertise. As such, they are appealing to scammers, and they will likely become more prevalent over time.</p>

<p>Being that SMS Blaster Fraud is quite dangerous and could become more common, Google is sharing a few tips to help protect yourself. There have been protections against the attack vector <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12-2g-modem-kill-switch-feature">included in Android since Android 12</a>, the company says. You can turn off 2G at the modem level to block this kind of attack. Moreover, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> added an option to disable null ciphers as a key protection method since SMS blasting requires them to deliver payloads.</p><p>However, a deterrent to disabling 2G altogether is that it could impact your ability to contact emergency services, which still depend on the technology. With that being said, Google notes that emergency calls will always work with 2G, even if the option is disabled. The company also points to its built-in Android spam protection features, which can help you figure out if an SMS is fraudulent before you fall victim to the trap.</p><p>So, is it worth disabling 2G to prevent SMS Blaster Fraud? It might be, but a better option may be to become more aware that SMS messages have a high chance of being scams. If you are being asked to share personal information, one-time passwords, or other types of highly sensitive information, it’s probably not authentic. Keeping a keen eye for fraud and scams and being more vigilant could be more helpful in the long run than disabling 2G and forgetting about it.</p>
