<ul><li>A new report shows that Google has brought the Noise Control option for Android 15 back to the redesigned volume panel.</li><li>Users with the Pixel Buds Pro can now quickly swap between ANC and transparency mode again after the button's sudden disappearance.</li><li>Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 arrived last week and showcased the potential Android 16 Quick Settings panel.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted rolling out an audio feature addition to Android 15 to prepare for its official launch.</p><p>Android 15 is beginning to receive an update containing the return of the "Noise Control" option for connected audio devices. As detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1835432242858152229">Mishaal Rahman</a> on X, this button should give users easier control over the ANC and transparency modes of earbuds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>In the volume panel, users will find the Noise Control option in line with Spatial Audio and Live Captions. Tapping the new button will show the previously mentioned earbud modes alongside an "off" option.</p><p>Android 15 originally missed this option due to a redesign. Its return to the volume panel should make it easier for users to swap between listening modes when necessary.</p>

<p>Google was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-volume-panel-redesign-collapsible">rolling out a redesign</a> for Android 15&apos;s volume panel in April during Developer Preview 2. The new panel offers a much larger, clearer look at your pill-shaped volume sliders. Muting a stream is now done by tapping the sound&apos;s source icon. With the choice to expand or shrink the redesigned panel, switching to a set of Pixel Buds Pro saw the exclusion of Noise Control.</p><p>Rahman adds that the button, or "Slice," is brought about thanks to the Pixel Buds app to bring control of the earbuds to the volume panel. Google&apos;s return of the option brings some much-needed convenience back to the volume panel.</p><p>In other news, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a> for enrolled testers last week. The patch had many Pixel fixes for Bluetooth and other system bugs. However, the update included glimpses into some upcoming features like a Quick Panel redesign. Users were also surprised by the arrival of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1834294677157101611">desktop windowing</a>" during that update.</p><p>Like the volume panel, it seems Google wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notifications-quick-settings-panel-android-16-rumor">rework the Quick Settings menu</a>. While the company has advanced its development, rumors claim we likely won&apos;t see this until Android 16 — but there&apos;s always hope.</p><p>We&apos;re still waiting for Android 15 to hit devices, though rumors claim it could happen in October.</p>

<ul><li>Early rumors about the next ASUS ROG Phone suggest there will be a display "upgrade."</li><li>Rumors fail to detail those upgrades; however, a database listing shows the phone will likely sport 65W charging again.</li><li>The ROG Phone 8 series was a drastic shift in design from the Phone 7 as ASUS revamped the display, thinned the device, and changed its rear LEDs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like it&apos;s that time again for ROG Phone rumors, as a new post claims the next device could sport a worthy change.</p><p>Early leaks stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/5888095979/OxfJpuown?pagetype=groupfeed">Smart Pikachu&apos;s</a> post on Weibo, claiming the ROG Phone 9 could see an "upgrade" to its display (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rog-phone-9-leak-specs-3482187/">Android Authority</a>). Unfortunately, the tipster didn&apos;t specify what this updated display could look like. The publication speculates the Phone 9 could grab a "brighter," "higher resolution" display compared to the Phone 8 series.</p><p>The tipster did provide a snapshot of ASUS pushing the alleged ROG Phone 9 through China&apos;s Quality Certification Centre. Per the listing, it seems the device will continue to feature 65W wired fast charging. Details about its battery capacity, which comments questioned, were unavailable.</p><p>Moreover, it seems the device was tagged with model number ASUSAI2501A.</p><p>Other rumors suggest the device will feature 24GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage. These numbers are likely of the device&apos;s maximum configuration. For comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8 Pro</a> offered similar options, though its base offerings were 12/256GB.</p><p>The ROG Phone 9 is rumored to grab Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, which is set to debut in October.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="tQoTc7NeiKXk2bEHQ2nhuD" name="asus-rog-phone-9-early-rumors.jpg" alt="A set of early rumors stating the ASUS ROG Phone 9 could feature a display upgrade and 65W charging." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQoTc7NeiKXk2bEHQ2nhuD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smart Pikachu / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding the supposed display upgrade, the Phone 8 delivered a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED display with FHD+. At its max, the device could provide a 165Hz refresh rate, which, considering its focus on gaming, is like a dream for mobile gamers. ASUS also protected the device&apos;s front panel with Corning&apos;s Gorilla Glass 2.</p><p>When ASUS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-launch-date-teaser">teased the device</a>, the company showed off its smaller bezels, turning its display into a more immersive experience. The slight "chin" on the top and bottom of the ROG Phone 7 was gone as ASUS brought in that punch-hole selfie camera.</p><p>The soon-to-be predecessor also features 65W wired fast charging. That speed helps recharge the 5,500mAh battery quickly — and it&apos;s the battery capacity that we&apos;re still wondering about for the Phone 9.</p><p>The design of the Phone 8 was also radically different compared to the devices before it. During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-series-launch">its launch</a>, ASUS showed off its minimalistic back panel outfitted with a set of 341 programmable LEDs known as "AniMe Vision." The Phone 8 and 8 Pro packed a load of AI-backed programs like "X Capture" to record highlights during intense moments and AI Grabber for quick game-related searches.</p><p>With such radical changes, what ASUS has planned for the Phone 9 series is still anyone&apos;s guess.</p>

<ul><li>A few Galaxy S25 Plus renderings have leaked and suggest design cues similar to the other two series devices.</li><li>The phone is rumored to arrive slightly thinner than the 2024 model with all-black camera sensors, flat sides, and rounded corners.</li><li>Another leak claimed the phone may stick with the 4,900mAh battery; however, its charging strength wasn't stated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We might have the entire Galaxy S25 series to look at now as an alleged rendering of the Plus model surfaces.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-2025">Android Headlines</a>, known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1836060662511923515">OnLeaks</a> provided a glimpse into the potential design changes of the Galaxy S25 Plus. At first glance, the device may (unsurprisingly) stick to a design similar to leaked renders of the other two series models. The Galaxy S25 Plus is rumored to feature a clean rear panel with a triple vertical camera array that sees a slight change.</p><p>The lenses are purported to debut with a thicker black ring around each lens. It&apos;d be quite a change <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">over the Galaxy  S24 Plus</a> and the S24 series in general as those phones had a thinner, shimmering outline much closer to the lens.</p><p>A 6.7-inch display might greet consumers once more while rumors add the S25 Plus could see a "marginal" dimension change. According to the post, the phone might arrive 0.4mm thinner than 2024&apos;s iteration. The device&apos;s rumored dimensions are as follows: 158.4 x 75.7 x 7.3mm. These are ever-so-slightly lower than its predecessor&apos;s 158.5 x 75.9 x 7.7 mm measurements.</p><p>The rendering suggests the Plus model will continue to feature rounded corners alongside flat sides, which has recently become a trend for Samsung. Overall, these alleged S25 Plus renders theorize a device that will mirror its predecessor, except for the potential camera lens ring swap.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication spotted Ice Universe&apos;s speculation on the phone&apos;s battery capacity (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-battery-capacity-leaked/">SamMobile</a>). Speculation states the S25 Plus will feature a 4,900mAh battery, the same as the S24 version.</p>

<p>It might not be a surprise that Samsung may stick with the same battery capacity as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-wont-probably-blow-your-mind-with-its-battery-life">a previous rumor</a> stated a similar future for the Ultra model. The top-of-the-line edition could stick with the same 5,000mAh battery paired with 45W wired charging. Ice Universe&apos;s recent post on X claims the vanilla S25 will also stick with the same 4,000mAh capacity.</p><p>Charging strengths for the Plus and vanilla models weren&apos;t stated, though it&apos;s hard to see Samsung changing them.</p><p>What is (apparently) changing are the camera rings for the upcoming S25 series. A previous set of renderings leaked for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">the base S25</a>, showing a similar tune. That device was rumored to debut at a slightly thinner and smaller measurement. The S25 seems fairly close to the S24; however, a device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">with more change</a> could be the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Early renderings showed off a device that was incredibly flat with the sides to go with it and rounded corners. The softer corners could help the handheld experience as older Ultra users will know about those sharp corners in their palms. Additionally, another rumor claims the Ultra model could sport a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-narrow-body-frame-rumors">narrower aspect ratio</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta introduced its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-rolling-out-a-restricted-version-of-its-app-for-teens">Instagram Teen Accounts</a> today. It&apos;s designed to control what your teenager can access while using Instagram and to limit who can contact them through their Instagram account. </p><p>It looks good to investors and concerned parent groups, but this is not how you fix anything because it&apos;s probably not going to work as well as we would like.</p>
<p>I think of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-new-kid-friendly-features">parental control software</a> the same way I think of the door lock on your house. They are there to make sure people who want to do the "right thing" will do it but don&apos;t deter anyone else. If I want to break into your house, no lock will stop me and if your kids want to do or see something on the internet you do not approve of, they will.</p><p>This sort of software isn&apos;t necessarily bad. A minor child has no say when it comes to rules about being online because mom or dad are 100% in charge of their well-being. And that kind of responsibility can be overwhelming for some parents. Relying on a software solution to act as a nanny can seem helpful, and for a lot of kids, it might work — mom or dad said no can be enough to do the "right" thing.</p>
<p>I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and say most kids aren&apos;t like this, based on my own experience as a kid. I&apos;m old enough that we didn&apos;t have Instagram or any sort of social media, but there were things we were pressured to do, just like peer pressure can make a kid today want to be all-in when it comes to being online. And yeah, a lot of the time, I did what I could get away with. Deterrents were only inconveniences.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5760px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="SX2nXLvwDtMDyfDaAy6rzA" name="Instagram-teen-accounts-notification.png" alt="Instagram teen accounts notifications" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SX2nXLvwDtMDyfDaAy6rzA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5760" height="3840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that&apos;s the real problem here — software is never going to stop your kids from doing what they want to do. As long as they have access to Google, they will be able to bypass any filtering software you&apos;ve set up. Kids are smart. Usually smarter than mom and dad when it comes to this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>In this case, it&apos;s even easier. There&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-two-factor-authentication-your-instagram-account">Instagram account</a> mom and dad can see, and then there&apos;s the other one a kid can make with a free email address. One is used to talk with family and friends from church, and the other is used to be yourself — or what you think you want yourself to be. Remember, the internet is forever, and what you do and say today will follow you throughout your life.</p><p>Instagram uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-ways-to-verify-age-on-instagram" target="_blank">age verification software</a> in a number of countries, but something like this could be bypassed by pointing to a free VPN to say you live in an eastern European country like Croatia. Like everything else, software can&apos;t stop anyone who is determined.</p><p>Meta could solve this if they wanted to. One Instagram account per device means the only account a kid can have is the one mom and dad approve of — unless a kid has a secret phone for their secret Instagram, of course. Even trying to use the web browser could be redirected to only open the app. If Meta really cared, it would do this.</p>
<p>Things like this pop up all the time; companies have to try and build controls into their software because the world has things parents don&apos;t approve of. I get it and agree. There are some things out there a kid should simply not engage with.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying companies shouldn&apos;t build things like this, but let&apos;s not pretend it&apos;s going to be a perfect solution. Maybe a better way to handle it is to talk with your kids. Let them know they will see and hear a bunch of crazy while they are online, and help them make the right decision themselves. Just because you&apos;re a parent doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t also be a friend.</p><p>I&apos;m not about to tell you how to raise your children. I will tell you that any parental control you set up is easy to bypass because your kids are smarter than you give them credit for. That includes the Instagram Teen Experience.</p>

<p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">launched the Moto Tag</a> at the tail end of June 2024, and sales went live about a month ago. I put it to the test as soon as I got my hands on the Bluetooth tracker, which was about one and a half weeks ago.</p><p>I have tested literally all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">best Bluetooth trackers</a> available to buy today, so I just <em>had</em> to test the Moto Tag. I&apos;m not going to lie though, it was pretty underwhelming at first. The most interesting part of a Bluetooth tracker, beyond its ability to track, is the extra bits. Motorola didn&apos;t advertise anything that I hadn&apos;t already seen in other trackers, so I was worried.</p><p>Every other tracker from Tile, Pebblebee, Samsung, and Chipolo can track your stuff when within range. They all cost roughly the same, priced between $20 to $30. The key factors that differ are the battery replaceability, the Bluetooth range, the IP rating, the loudness of the ringer, the form factor, and, of course, support for Android and iOS. The Moto Tag gets a lot right, but unfortunately, it fails to innovate and isn&apos;t good enough to beat the best from Tile or Pebblebee. You&apos;ll understand why in a bit.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9kJKAnqJTJwNAtLdpbxgiH" name="Motorola-Moto-Tag-lifestyle-5.jpg" alt="Motorola Moto Tag" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9kJKAnqJTJwNAtLdpbxgiH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Moto Tag, it&apos;s all about the design at first glance. It is very stylish and comes in two colors: Starlight Blue and Sage Green. Unlike most other brands, you don&apos;t have black-and-white color variants to choose from. This circular disc is small and almost exactly the same size as the Apple AirTag, measuring 32mm x 32mm x 8mm, similar to the AirTag&apos;s 31.9mm x 31.9mm x 8mm dimensions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3718px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EcGQUecRH7N5yJNHo3CakB" name="Motorola-Moto-Tag-lifestyle-6.jpg" alt="Motorola Moto Tag" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EcGQUecRH7N5yJNHo3CakB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3718" height="2092" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something that&apos;s different and somewhat questionable about the Moto Tag is the lack of a keyring hole. I believe this was intentional because all Apple AirTag accessories, like keyring holders, fit the Moto Tag, which is a pretty significant benefit. Oddly enough, Motorola doesn&apos;t sell its own Tag holders, so you&apos;re forced to purchase third-party accessories made for the AirTag. That&apos;s already extra money you need to spend just to be able to use the tracker for most use cases. In contrast, competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tile-bluetooth-trackers-review">Tile Pro</a> and Pebblebee Clip come with a keyring hole.</p>

<p>Once you&apos;re done ogling the beautiful but impractically made Moto Tag, you can go ahead and set it up. I did this twice, once on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> and the second time on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> for testing purposes. Since the Tag is compatible with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">Google Find My Device network</a>, it sets up in a matter of seconds. What&apos;s not so breezy is the resetting process, something I never struggled with before on trackers from Tile, Chipolo, or Pebblebee.</p><p>The Moto Tag has a big button in the center. All trackers have this so you can locate your phone, as does the Moto Tag, or use extra features. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, this button can allow you to remotely click pictures on your camera app. But you can also use this button to factory reset the Tag. Unfortunately, the button on the Moto Tag is not very tactile, and it&apos;s very hard to press. The click isn&apos;t audible, and there&apos;s hardly any tactile feedback, so sometimes you can&apos;t even tell if the button was pressed or not.</p>

<p>Much like the Tile Pro, the Moto Tag has a replaceable CR2032 battery, which should last for about a year. The Pebblebee Clip has a USB-C port built-in, which is even more user-friendly and sustainable. Unlike the Pebblebee Clip&apos;s IPX6 waterproofing, the Moto Tag sports a robust IP67 water and dust-resistant rating, and you can customize the loudness of the ringer through the companion app. Unlike Tile or Chipolo, you can&apos;t change the ringtone itself, though.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">I have tested all the newest trackers from Chipolo, Tile, and Pebblebee</a>, so I can confidently say that the Moto Tag isn&apos;t the loudest tracker around. Chipolo and Tile dominate that arena. Both Pebblebee and Motorola&apos;s trackers sound roughly the same in terms of loudness.</p><p>As for the Bluetooth range, the Moto Tag has one of 100m, which is really good and better than the Tile Mate&apos;s 76m and Chipolo One&apos;s 60m ranges. The Pebblebee Clip beats everyone with its 152m range, with the Tile Pro coming in second with a 121m range. On top of that, phones with UWB (ultra-wide bandwidth) get even more precise location-finding features. This is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">Galaxy SmartTag</a>, but that only works with Samsung&apos;s UWB-compatible phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HxLNDVzg4tu5f8vLKnRnAH" name="Motorola-Moto-Tag-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="Motorola Moto Tag" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HxLNDVzg4tu5f8vLKnRnAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like most other Bluetooth trackers, the Moto Tag works with both Android and iOS. However, it does not work with Apple&apos;s Find My Device network. On the other hand, the Pebblebee Clip gives you two variants, one with the option to use Apple&apos;s network and the other with Google&apos;s networks. Meanwhile, Tile enables universal support for Android and iOS with its trackers but you don&apos;t get Google Find My Device support.</p><p>To summarize. the Moto Tag costs $29.99, which is roughly the same as every other decent Bluetooth tracker. While the Moto Tag offers one or two bonus features, these are limited to Motorola devices or phones with UWB. You only benefit if you have either one of those or you care about the additional dust resistance.</p><p>Motorola didn&apos;t really do anything new or different, so it&apos;s not good enough for anyone to want to choose it over more well-known players in the game. A very small segment of users will benefit from the Moto Tag&apos;s extra features. Everyone else will probably just get something from Tile or Pebblebee. And why shouldn&apos;t they?</p>

<p>The Moto Tag looks really nice, and it has all the usual run-of-the-mill features that other trackers do. However, the lack of novelty makes it hard for Motorola to stand out and differentiate as a Bluetooth tracker worth buying — for non-Motorola users at any rate.</p></p>

<hr>
<p>The Roku Channel has reached a major milestone by fully blending into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>’s search tools.</p><p>Google TV really wants to lock in its spot as the go-to streaming hub. It’s packed with free channels, personalized picks, watchlist options, and access to nearly every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">popular streaming app</a>. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-roku-channel-google-android-tv">landing on Google TV in July of last year</a>, The Roku Channel now sits alongside apps like Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+ in search recommendations, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/google-tv-expands-free-content-reach-integrates-the-roku-channel-into-recommendations/" target="_blank">Cord Cutters News</a>.</p><p>With the streaming service now built into its search tools, Google TV makes it easier for viewers to find tons of free content. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/roku-channels-best-channels-whats-free-whats-paid-and-how-watch">The Roku Channel</a>’s massive library includes thousands of shows and over 350 live TV channels.</p><p>The exact timing of the integration isn’t clear, but it fits with Google’s plan to boost free ad-supported viewing. To get The Roku Channel recommendations, just download the app on your Google TV, activate it via the Google TV Mobile app, go to your profile, choose "Manage services," and switch on The Roku Channel.</p><p>This move signals Google&apos;s growing effort to double down on free streaming after it recently rebranded its hub to Google TV Freeplay.</p><p>The Google TV Freeplay section boasts over 150 curated FAST channels and replaces the old Google TV label under "Free built-in channels," better reflecting its offerings.</p><p>While it&apos;s not a game-changer, the new branding sets the stage for Google to broaden its free content lineup, possibly adding more channels from its own platforms like YouTube.</p><p>With the new Roku integration and the rebranding to Google TV Freeplay, Google is clearly aiming to boost its competitive edge by offering a wider range of budget-friendly entertainment options. This move not only strengthens Google TV’s position as a major streaming player but also helps increase its revenue as streaming hardware gets cheaper.</p>

<hr>
<p>Instagram is now automatically setting some teen accounts to limit who can reach out to them and what content they’re exposed to, the platform announced today.</p><p>The new "Teen Accounts" feature aims to protect teens under 16 from unwanted messages. This means only people they follow or are already connected with can message them, keeping strangers out of their DMs.</p><p>By default, teen accounts are set to private, meaning they get to approve new followers, and random people can’t creep on their content or interact with them.</p><p>Parents can now check who their teen has been messaging recently. However, they won&apos;t be able to read the actual messages.</p>

<p>Meta is also auto-setting all teen accounts to Instagram’s strictest content controls. This applies to both new users and those already on the app. With the “Sensitive Content Control,” it’s tougher for teens to stumble upon sensitive content or sketchy accounts in places like Explore and Reels.</p><p>For good measure, parents can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram-family-center">check out the age-appropriate topics</a> their teen has selected based on their interests.</p>

<p>Today&apos;s announcement means that teens under 16 will need parental permission to change these settings, while those over 16 can adjust them on their own—unless their account is being supervised, in which case they&apos;ll need a parent’s okay to make any changes.</p><p>To further boost safety, teen accounts will be set up to allow tagging and mentions only from people they follow. Plus, the "Hidden Words" feature will be turned on by default, filtering out offensive language from comments and DMs.</p>

<p>Instagram is also introducing a new feature called "Daily Limit" to help teens manage their screen time. After 60 minutes, the app will gently nudge teens to take a break. Younger teens will need parental approval to extend their time limit.</p><p>Additionally, Instagram is rolling out Sleep Mode, which stops notifications after 10pm and before 7am, so teens can get a good night&apos;s sleep. This new feature replaces Quiet Mode and Night Nudges. Parents can also choose to block Instagram completely at night using the parental supervision tool.</p><p>Meta first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-restrictions-for-teens-on-instagram-and-facebook">announced these built-in protections earlier this year</a>. Now, new teen sign-ups will get the features right away, while current users will be alerted about the changes and transitioned to Teen Accounts next week.</p>

<p>Instagram plans to roll out Teen Accounts in the U.S., UK, Canada, and Australia within the next 60 days, with the EU getting them later this year. Globally, teens will start seeing these accounts in January. Plus, the feature will be coming to other Meta platforms next year.</p>

<p>Comparing the Google Pixel 9 vs. Motorola Edge 2024 might seem like a futile endeavour, but bear with me. Other than a Pixel, a Motorola phone is the next best thing if you&apos;re looking for a clean Android experience. Moto phones are also known to pack great hardware at very aggressive prices, have excellent display specs, and tend to offer premium features in lower segments where no one else does.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 costs nearly half of what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> is currently priced at, and it does have better features and specs in some areas. If your priority is stock Android, an eye-friendly display, and a lightweight phone, does the Moto have an edge (pun intended) over the Pixel?</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-20.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 and the Edge 2024 take very different approaches to design. Google has stuck with the metal and glass style but has brought about major revisions to the Pixel&apos;s look, which makes it appear distinct from past Pixel phones. I love the way it looks, especially the new colors. The heavily rounded corners of the metal frame also make it feel much smaller in the hand, and its dimensions are roughly the same as the Pixel 8a. The camera module sticks out a bit, but it&apos;s an aesthetic that grows on you.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge 2024</a> has the same width as the Pixel 9, but it&apos;s taller and way slimmer. With a depth of 8.1mm, it&apos;s noticeably thinner than the 8.5mm thickness of the Pixel. It&apos;s also incredibly light at just 174g, compared to the hefty 198g of the Pixel 9. Another big difference is the finish of the back panel on the Moto, which is vegan leather. It only comes in one color sadly, but the texture offers far better grip than a glass back and there&apos;s no worry of it getting damaged if it falls. You can easily use the Moto without a case and still handle it very well. The Pixel 9 will probably need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">good case</a>, but thankfully there are plenty of those to go around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-04.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As impressive as the Pixel 9&apos;s display is, the Motorola Edge 2024 actually beats the Pixel in a couple of areas. The Edge 2024 has a larger 6.6-inch pOLED display with a Full HD resolution and an impressive 144Hz refresh rate. For scratch protection, you only get Gorilla Glass 3, which is a bit inferior for 2024 and the peak brightness is 1,300 nits. But those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">flicker-sensitive vision</a> will appreciate the fact that you can completely disable the PWM dimming for an irritation-free viewing. Even if you don&apos;t, the Edge has a high 720Hz PWM dimming at lower brightness.</p><p>The Pixel 9 features a more resilient Gorilla Glass Victus 2 scratch protection and a higher peak brightness of 2,700 nits. The 6.3-inch display is also smaller, and more manageable for smaller hands. The resolution is the same as Moto, which means you get denser pixels. Unfortunately, Google still uses the draconian 240Hz PWM dimming for the display, which can play havoc if you&apos;re sensitive to screen flickering.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Przoy49oabyDb8ytFx9nR8" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-13.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Przoy49oabyDb8ytFx9nR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3780" height="2126" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google claws back major points when it comes to hardware as the Pixel 9 has a flagship SoC, compared to a mid-range chip in the Edge 2024. The Pixel 9 ships with 12GB of RAM, two storage options of 128GB or 256GB, and the Tensor G4 SoC. In comparison, the Motorola Edge 2024 has the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, and just a single variant with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage. Neither phones support expandable storage. In terms of benchmarks and real-world performance, the Pixel easily beats the Moto, but then again it better considering what it costs.</p><p>Speaking of cost, the Pixel 9 starts at $799 and costs $899 if you opt for the higher 256GB storage variant. You can get it at a slight discount on Amazon and other places, or if you buy it via a contract with your carrier. It&apos;s still quite expensive considering this is the non-Pro model with many premium features missing.</p><p>The Moto Edge 2024 made a terrible first impression when it launched in June 2024 for $550, as other phones like the OnePlus 12R and Pixel 8a offered far better value. The price is more palatable now at $450.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nVgoQC8RrC4MPhAMY6E7uU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-wallpaper-01.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024) with custom wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVgoQC8RrC4MPhAMY6E7uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Edge 2024 has excellent battery life thanks to its large capacity, and it can also charge very quickly at up to 68W, but the charger needs to be bought separately. It also supports 15W wireless charging, which is impressive when you consider this is a sub-$500 phone. The Pixel 9 delivers similarly good battery life, despite the smaller capacity. You should expect it to last a full day on one charge, with medium to heavy usage. You don&apos;t get a charger in the box here too, but the Pixel 9 can only charge at up to 27W with Google&apos;s 45W adapter.</p><p>The camera is one area where you can&apos;t take the crown away from Google. The Pixel 9 delivers amazing image quality from all of its cameras thanks to the capable sensors and Google&apos;s stellar AI and ML-driven post-processing. The Edge 2024 boasts big camera specs on paper, but the reality is quite mediocre. The images it captures are just about fine, but don&apos;t expect to be winning any awards for it.</p>

<p>Both phones have excellent software so it really depends on what you&apos;re looking for. If you&apos;re not too fussy about having the latest AI features, you&apos;ll absolutely love the software on the Motorola. It&apos;s now called Hello UI and it&apos;s basically stock Android 14 with a few extra bits from Motorola. There&apos;s very little bloatware just like a Pixel, and some of the extra first-party apps are superb. PC users will love <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> as you can seamlessly go from using the keyboard and mouse on Windows to controlling your phone with them. There&apos;s a customizable side button too, which can be programmed to open an app or an action.</p><p>The only bummer is that Motorola only offers two generations of major platform upgrades. The Pixel 9 on the other hand is promised seven years of OS and security updates, and it will get them on day one. Motorola doesn&apos;t have the best track record for timely updates, but you don&apos;t have to worry about that with a Pixel.</p><p>You can also expect quality AI features and killer editing apps with the Pixel 9. The Reimagine feature in Google&apos;s Magic Editor is unlike anything we&apos;ve seen before on a phone, allowing you to instantly alter an image in a very realistic manner.</p>

<p>Since both phones are in completely different price bands, it&apos;s hard to pick a definitive winner. Going back to our original question about which one offers better value in terms of software, display, and ergonomics, I&apos;d recommend the Motorola Edge 2024 over the Pixel 9. At its current reduced price of $450, it&apos;s better value than when it launched, although another $50 off would really make it the most attractive. Things that it does better than the Pixel would be the more eye-friendly display, battery life, slim design, and charging speed. Keep in mind that the cameras are average, software support is limited, and the processor is not great for gaming.</p><p>The Pixel 9 fills the shortcomings of the Motorola Edge 2024, but it doesn&apos;t have the best display if you&apos;re sensitive to display flicker. The battery probably won&apos;t last as long either and charging is slower compared to the Moto Edge. The biggest problem though, is the price. You&apos;re paying a steep premium for a handful of exclusive software features. A more wallet-friendly option with nearly the same feature set would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. You can find the top-storage variant for under $600 today, which makes it superb value.</p>

Are they really ready for a smartphone? Will they be ostracized by their friends without the right phone? How do you keep them safe online if they do get one?</p><p>Everyone&apos;s situation is different, so while my personal experience may not apply <em>precisely</em> to you, I&apos;ve been through all of these thoughts and have some advice that might help give you peace of mind.</p><p>If you&apos;re thinking of getting a smartphone for your kid this year, here are a few things to think about before hitting that buy button.</p>
<h2 id="does-my-child-really-need-a-phone-2">Does my child really need a phone?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f" name="fitbit-ace-lte-wearing-02.jpg" alt="A child wearing the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before even thinking of what <em>kind</em> of phone your child needs, consider the option of foregoing the phone entirely. Instead, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">best kids smartwatches</a> might be a better alternative for some kids or parents.</p><p>My son&apos;s favorite is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-review">T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch</a>, which is free on T-Mobile when you activate it with the T-Mobile watch service (usually $10 per month). There&apos;s a new model now but since I haven&apos;t used that, I&apos;ll go over the previous model&apos;s highlights.</p><p>Among excellent features like video calling, text and voice messaging, and real-time location tracking is the dinosaur game. Yes, the same game you play in Chrome when you don&apos;t have an internet connection. It seems funny to highlight this but it&apos;s one of the reasons my son loves it over other kid&apos;s watches, and it makes it easy for me to let him use it since the other features work so well.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re not a T-Mobile user, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> works on all U.S. networks and, as the Fitbit name suggests, is heavily focused on keeping your kids healthy through active fitness encouragement.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>An LTE-enabled smartwatch might be a better fit for many kids, especially if you just want a line of communication with them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Fitbit does this by tracking activity via the advanced hardware on the watch—which is just as advanced as what&apos;s inside the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>—and turns your child&apos;s active moments into tokens that can be spent playing arcade games on the watch.</p><p>But these aren&apos;t just any old video games. All of the games on the Fitbit Ace LTE require physical movement of some kind. From flinging your wrist like a fishing pole to catch fish, to aiming your spaceship to take out enemy ships, even the games will keep your kids moving more often during the day.</p><p>Of course, being an LTE-enabled watch also means phone calls, text and voice messages, and active GPS tracking are all available, making it easy to forego the phone for something a little simpler (and less easy to lose or break).</p>

<p>If a smartwatch isn&apos;t the right choice for your child, a phone might be a more powerful, fitting solution. A smartphone is far more capable than a watch in every regard and likely has better battery life than most kids smartwatches, too. And while the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best smartphones</a> mostly keeps going up and up, there are plenty of choices for kids that are a lot more affordable.</p><p>First, you&apos;ll want to consider the level of parental controls your child needs. For a long time now, my son has been using an older phone (more on that later) with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">Google Family Link</a> account. At the very least, this is the avenue I&apos;d recommend if you&apos;re not sure what your needs are, as Family Link gives you a decent way to control apps, set screen time limits, and remotely track your child&apos;s phone&apos;s location when needed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="gu9YcNx24AXpbLscYmxi8j" name="google-family-link.jpg" alt="The Google Family Link app's main dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gu9YcNx24AXpbLscYmxi8j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google Family Link is free but only offers basic parental controls.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Some parents might want a little more control, though, especially if they&apos;ve got kids who love to search the web or chat with friends. If you&apos;ve already got a phone picked out for your kids—or they&apos;re just getting a hand-me-down—consider using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canopy.vpn.filter.parent">Canopy</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cm.pt.barkparent">Bark</a> apps. I&apos;ve used each and I&apos;d recommend starting a free trial for both services to see which works best for your family.</p><p>Both apps work similarly and can help you not only control apps, screen time limits, and perform real-time remote location tracking, but they also help monitor communication and filter out the bad things that can happen online. Both services require a monthly subscription but are fully worth the cost given the elaborate scope beyond Google&apos;s free Family Link service.</p><p>At a high level, both services filter internet traffic and scan communications using AI algorithms that automatically identify unsafe content, including explicit images and words, and can even go beyond mere filtering by helping to identify harmful behavior or speech your child or their friends might be engaging in.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Parental control options are available for any Android phone, but a phone specifically made for kids gives you the most control.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If this concept appeals to you but you don&apos;t already have a phone you can pass down, consider picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bark-Phone-Parental-Controls-Unlimited/dp/B0D9MQK6W8/">Bark Phone</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Gabb-Phone-Safe-Built-Teens/dp/B0D749T6DG/">Gabb Phone</a>. I&apos;ve used all the major kids&apos; phones out there and these two are my favorite. Gabb even includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gabb.com/gabb-music/">its own music streaming service</a> that includes millions of songs with filtered tracks that keep things safe for your kids.</p><p>Both companies use Samsung Galaxy phones as a base, then preinstall the parental control software in a way that&apos;s impossible to remove. It&apos;s a turnkey solution since you will only need to activate the phone and register the parental app on your device to control it.</p><p>Even if you don&apos;t pick up a Gabb Phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gabb.com/blog/">Gabb Blog</a> has a wealth of information for parents looking to decode kids&apos; slang and figure out other important topics.</p>

<p>The Bark Phone makes it easy to choose what to get your kids this year. It's got built-in parental controls that make it easy to keep your kids safe, and since it all runs on a great Samsung phone, you know you'll be getting software updates on it for years to come.</p></p>

<p>Now, as someone who has developed a sensitivity to flickering lights over years of using smartphones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, I prefer to pick my own phone out and install either Bark or Canopy on it. That way, I can find a display that I feel is safer for my child than displays on Samsung, Google, or Apple phones, which are known for their flickering displays.</p><p>Not everyone is going to be concerned about this but if you are, I recommend phones from brands like Motorola, TCL, OnePlus, Nothing, and Honor, to name a few. These companies are much more careful about selecting flicker-free displays—or providing display options to reduce flicker—which makes me feel better about the time my son spends on his phone and what potentially harmful things smartphone displays could do over time.</p>

He doesn&apos;t have a SIM card in his phone—we use smartwatches for that—so this phone is primarily his mobile gaming machine and personal digital camera.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a new phone that will see years of support, I&apos;d recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>. You can pick it up for around $200-280 depending on what you need from it and its customizable design means your child will have fun making it their own. Plus, it&apos;s got plenty of power for anything your child will need, even if that means mobile games with impressive graphics.</p><p>But a powerful phone isn&apos;t necessary at all, especially if you&apos;re not keen on your kids installing apps or games from the Play Store. In fact, most of the "kids phones" out there—like Bark, Gabb, Pinwheel, and others—typically forego powerful specs for phones with a focus on better battery life. Most of those phones have curated app stores, which means regular apps from the Google Play Store can&apos;t be installed, anyway.</p>

<p>This question is much tougher to answer than any of the others simply because there are seventy bajillion apps (actually, around 3.3 million) in the Google Play Store. While Google does a good job of ensuring apps and games are rated, categorized, and tagged for organization, some apps are free and supported by ads—and ad content can be very questionable at times.</p><p>My advice here would be to stay away from completely free games which are all almost exclusively financially supported by ads. Since there&apos;s no real way to control the content that comes through ad networks, staying clear of them altogether is a better option. Instead, choose games that follow the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335">Google Play Families Policies</a>. You&apos;ll find this listed under the <strong>data safety section</strong> in each app listing on the Play Store. Here&apos;s what that looks like:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1148px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.46%;"><img id="e742eWfCgnP3ZRvfYBaU6e" name="google-play-families-policy-app-store-listing.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a Google Play Store listing showing that the app in question follows Google Play Families Policies" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e742eWfCgnP3ZRvfYBaU6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1148" height="476" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Internet safety can be scary, but services like Bark and Canopy can help filter all kinds of content across all available apps.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As for other types of apps, I recommend sticking with brands you know. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.talk">Messenger Kids by Meta</a> uses Facebook&apos;s wide network of coverage and Meta&apos;s incredibly smart tools to keep your kids safe while talking only with approved contacts, including friends and family.</p><p>My son has used this one for years and it not only makes it easy for him to message his friends and play games with them right through Messenger, but he can also video call and voice call anyone on his contact list without the need for a SIM card. It&apos;s the very best way for kids to stay in contact with you, even if they only have Wi-Fi connectivity.</p><p>For kids with phones that have a SIM card, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging">Google Messages</a> will safely send and receive SMS, MMS, and RCS messaging through your child&apos;s phone number and even filters spam automatically.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kah6eNJejVmh6vWp8pU2GM" name="Amazon-Fire-HD-10-Kids-ProTablet-lifestyle-16x9-07.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kah6eNJejVmh6vWp8pU2GM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to video and other types of entertainment, the options aren&apos;t quite as good as I hoped. Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids">YouTube Kids</a> app lets you curate what your kids are allowed to watch, including content that&apos;s specifically approved for viewing by kids that has fewer (or no) ads. But the app isn&apos;t the most user-friendly, and parents regularly complain about how some content keeps coming back even after they&apos;ve removed it.</p><p>Likewise, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.tahoe.freetime">Amazon Kids+</a> service includes books, videos, and other things, parents find that filtering content could be easier. I specifically hand-pick videos and books for my son and do my best to be nearby, especially when he&apos;s watching something. He also knows that while he&apos;s allowed to branch out a bit on platforms like YouTube, he has to get my approval before watching anything new. If you&apos;re ever unsure, check the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history">YouTube history</a> section to see what&apos;s been recently watched.</p><p>I&apos;ve been pretty strict about content over the years and I feel good about where it&apos;s gotten me and my son. We feel strongly about using shared spaces to be with each other, even if we&apos;re doing different things. It helps keep everyone accountable and makes it easy to have conversations about important topics—or just keep an eye on what&apos;s on the other side of the screen.</p><p>The internet can be a scary place, but with a little bit of homework and curation—plus time spent watching and reading alongside them—everyone can have a fun and safe time.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s a decent set of choices if you want to buy XR glasses these days, and while Xreal gets a bulk of the attention in this category, TCL-backed RayNeo has carved out a niche on the back of strong releases. I started using the Air 2 last year, and what became immediately clear was the sheer quality of the Micro-OLED panel; with a 201-inch projection, 600-nit brightness, and 120Hz refresh, TCL ticked all the right boxes.</p><p>But there were issues with blurriness around the edges, and the limited adjustability meant I couldn&apos;t quite get a secure fit. Thankfully, RayNeo is addressing those issues with the Air 2S; the smart glasses share the same Micro-OLED panel as the standard model, but there&apos;s much less edge fuzzing this time, you get better adjustability, and the sound quality is markedly different.</p><p>Smart glasses are particularly great for gaming and streaming content, and the Air 2S excels at these scenarios. I used the Air 2S for just over a month, and here&apos;s why I think these smart glasses are a great choice.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rayneo-air-2s-launch-and-availability"><span>RayNeo Air 2S: Launch and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZkAXug3b9n5Sj429Mhyqy6" name="rayneo-air-2s-11.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZkAXug3b9n5Sj429Mhyqy6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RayNeo unveiled the Air 2S on August 15, and the smart glasses are now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RAYNEO-Air-2s-Glasses-Brightness-2024/dp/B0D8J5P11X">available on Amazon for $399</a>. They can also be bought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rayneo.com/products/rayneo-air_2s">via RayNeo&apos;s website</a>, and the brand is bundling the MiraScreen Portable Adapter with all orders until September 15. If you&apos;re looking to get the Air 2S to stream content, there&apos;s a bundle that includes the outstanding Pocket TV — think of it as a battery-powered Chromecast — that will set you back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-GTV-Media-Glasses-Bundle/dp/B0DCZRHSXR">to the tune of $539</a>.</p><p>With the Air 2S now on sale, RayNeo is discounting the original Air 2, and the smart glasses can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RAYNEO-Air-2s-Glasses-Brightness-2024/dp/B0D8J5P11X">bought for $299</a>. There are plenty of differences between the two models, but if you want to maximize value, the Air 2 is still a decent choice.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rayneo-air-2s-what-i-like"><span>RayNeo Air 2S: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ykmm7ejuvYztzgjiuYLhb5" name="rayneo-air-2s-3.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ykmm7ejuvYztzgjiuYLhb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RayNeo made a lot of minor tweaks to the design of the Air 2S, and the result is that the smart glasses fit comfortably — and are lighter. There&apos;s a good amount of adjustability as well, and you can tilt the hinges on the sides to suit your preferences. The nose pads are also adjustable, and this ensures you get a secure fit.</p><p>Like most other smart glasses, RayNeo used a visor design at the front, and there&apos;s a silver tint that does a good job blocking out external light while still providing some visibility. There&apos;s nothing discreet about the design, and while the plastic chassis ensures the smart glasses are light, they are very prominent — particularly because of the visor.</p><p>Coming in at just 79g, the Air 2S is comfortable to wear for an extended duration, and there isn&apos;t any fatigue in this regard. I also like that RayNeo added controls to the smart glasses, so you can change color vibrancy, adjust the refresh rate, change brightness and volume from the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t9B62ERLJJdn64auw5Si97" name="rayneo-air-2s-8.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9B62ERLJJdn64auw5Si97.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key differentiator of the Air 2S is the display; it has dual Sony 0.55-inch Micro-OLED panels with 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh, and they&apos;re fantastic. You get lush colors with excellent vibrancy, and it&apos;s the brightness where the Air 2S really shines; it goes up to 600 nits, and even in outdoor use, I had to turn down the brightness levels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X5YvX8WbXXNuqpRCbhHsB6" name="rayneo-air-2s-7.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5YvX8WbXXNuqpRCbhHsB6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part of the Air 2S is that you don&apos;t need any custom software; just connect the glasses to any USB-C device, and you can start streaming content. This is particularly great if you&apos;ve got a gaming handheld and want to extend the screen size without connecting it to a TV. I used the Air 2S extensively with my Steam Deck, and it is an ideal pairing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4b8LUvCYDvZL6v2NT3Zgi5" name="rayneo-air-2s-4.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4b8LUvCYDvZL6v2NT3Zgi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t see any issues connecting the smart glasses to a host of Android devices, but I will note that the phone needs DisplayPort out; otherwise, you&apos;ll need to use an adapter. It wasn&apos;t an issue on recent Xiaomi and Vivo devices, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> didn&apos;t pose any issues in this area. Similarly, the iPhone 15 series connected without any trouble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kEnFGjb74rBQaf2ifayG36" name="rayneo-air-2s-6.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kEnFGjb74rBQaf2ifayG36.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 120Hz refresh makes a difference when gaming, and playing Hades on the Steam Deck when connected to the Air 2S was thoroughly enjoyable. Another upgrade over the Air 2 that is immediately noticeable is the audio quality; the Air 2S has quad speakers this time, and they get loud.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="j7twPfaWLkx3dhipZFWBM6" name="rayneo-air-2s-9.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7twPfaWLkx3dhipZFWBM6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound quality is astonishingly detailed when you consider the diminutive size of the drivers, and you even get decent bass. The bright Micro-OLED panel combined with the clear sound makes the Air 2S a terrific option in this category. On that note, RayNeo&apos;s Pocket TV accessory is a must-have if you&apos;re looking to get these smart glasses for entertainment.</p><p>The accessory connects via USB-C, and it is essentially a portable Chromecast device with Google TV. It is just as easy to use as any Google TV device, and you get onboard controls that make it relatively easy to navigate to the content you want to stream. There are issues with signing into services like Netflix, but once you&apos;ve set up the device, it&apos;s a great way to stream content without having to plug in your phone.</p><p>The Pocket TV has a built-in battery that lasts just over three hours between charges, and that&apos;s more than adequate if you want to stream a movie on the go.</p>

<p>While the Air 2S has considerable advantages over the standard model, it still misses out on a few features. There&apos;s no IPD adjustment available — which is standard on most VR headsets — and the smart glasses aren&apos;t ideal if you use prescription glasses. You can get custom inserts to use with the Air 2S, but that service isn&apos;t available in all regions.</p><p>Another annoyance is that because of the sheer size of the panel, the bottom portion tends to cut out when you&apos;re moving your head around. This is particularly annoying during gaming, and I had to reorient the glasses intermittently. There&apos;s still some blurriness around the edges, and that is noticeable when watching videos. It isn&apos;t anywhere as visible as the Air 2, but there&apos;s just enough that it becomes evident.</p><p>And as good as these smart glasses are for entertainment, they aren&apos;t suited for productivity tasks. RayNeo&apos;s Mirror Studio allows you to set up a 3D environment and select floating windows, but it is buggy at times, and has rendering issues.</p>

<p>Xreal is the obvious alternative to RayNeo, and the brand&apos;s Air 2 smart glasses use a similar Sony Micro-OLED tech and come in a design that&apos;s closer to regular wayfarers. The brightness isn&apos;t quite as high as what you get on the Air 2S, but they&apos;re a smidgen lighter, and have decent onboard sound.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TCmsnc2ftUTHLgJt3mJWV6" name="rayneo-air-2s-10.jpg" alt="RayNeo Air 2S smart glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCmsnc2ftUTHLgJt3mJWV6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want XR glasses for gaming and streaming content</li><li>You need a bright Micro-OLED panel</li><li>You want a lightweight design that's comfortable</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need prescription lenses</li><li>You need smart glasses for productivity</li><li>You need a robust software ecosystem</li></ul>
<p>Overall, RayNeo made a lot of necessary tweaks to the Air 2S, and the result is that the smart glasses are much better than the Air 2. While both smart glasses share the same Micro-OLED panel, there&apos;s less edge blurriness on the Air 2S, the sound quality is much better, and they&apos;re more comfortable to wear.</p><p>I don&apos;t think they do enough for productivity, and the best use case for these smart glasses is watching videos or playing games. An overwhelming majority of my usage has revolved around connecting the Air 2S to the Steam Deck to boost the size of Valve&apos;s handheld, and the smart glasses are terrific in this regard.</p><p>Similarly, video content is a delight on the Air 2S, and the quad speakers make a big difference. There&apos;s no HDR, but that isn&apos;t really a big omission, and the fact that you can project content onto a massive screen on the go is a novelty that doesn&apos;t wear off.</p><p>There are a few annoyances with RayNeo&apos;s software, but again, if you&apos;re just looking to get these glasses to stream videos, that&apos;s not going to be an issue. On the whole, the Air 2S is a great choice in this category, and the quality of the screen combined with the decent sound makes it worthy of a recommendation.</p>
