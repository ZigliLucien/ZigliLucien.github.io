                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I haven&apos;t paid much attention to Nothing&apos;s CMF sub-brand, but I like the sound quality (and design) of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">Ear 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a>, so I decided to try out the CMF Buds to see how they measure up. I tend to prefer IEMs with a neutral sound, but I will admit that the convenience that you get with wireless earbuds is unmatched.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>The key attribute of the CMF Buds is their accessibility; the earbuds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Cancelling-Waterproof-Headphones/dp/B0CXDGZ1WL">retail for just $39 in the U.S.</a>, and they&apos;re even more affordable in India, where they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/cmf-nothing-buds-42-db-active-noise-cancellation-ultra-bass-technology-35-5-hrs-playtime-bluetooth-gaming-headset/p/itmc68d1b79d6464">sell for ₹2,499 ($28)</a>. That&apos;s considerably less than the $99 retail price of the Ear 2, and you don&apos;t miss out on many features: the CMF Buds get fast pair, low latency mode, IP54 ingress protection, ANC, and Bluetooth 5.3.</p><p>Obviously, the Buds don&apos;t have the same see-through design that&apos;s distinctive to the Ear 2, but I think the design is eye-catching in its own right — particularly with the Clear Orange variant. The vibrant hue makes the earbuds stand out, and at 4.57g, they&apos;re light enough that you don&apos;t notice you&apos;re wearing them at all.</p><p>Nothing retained a similar overall structure as the Ear 2, so you get a bulbous shell and a short stalk. The shell has a glossy coat, but the stalk has a matte texture that makes it easier to trigger gestures. The fit is exquisite, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this regard even with extended use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BBuFmhNhqrgdgnCkFub49L" name="nothing-cmf-buds-9.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BBuFmhNhqrgdgnCkFub49L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The case is easily pocketable as well, and it has a dial that doesn&apos;t serve any utility; you just twirl it around if you&apos;re bored and want something to do. The build quality is decent, but the case has managed to pick up a <em>lot</em> of scratches in the two months I used the Buds — so in that sense, it is entirely too similar to the Ear 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QXxRf8wKkmUcZk2ioweLMK" name="nothing-cmf-buds-6.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXxRf8wKkmUcZk2ioweLMK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to fast pair, you can connect the buds to your phone without any hassle whatsoever, and I got a stable connection with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-reviewhttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>. The Buds integrate with Nothing&apos;s X utility, and you can tweak the sound profile, set up gestures, and change EQ modes with relative ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cF9pxUgRjLVxN9fBE9RnxJ" name="nothing-cmf-buds-7.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cF9pxUgRjLVxN9fBE9RnxJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while I didn&apos;t use it as much, there&apos;s a low latency gaming mode that comes in handy if you&apos;ve got the Phone 2a or another Nothing phone. A big talking point is the presence of ANC, and it does a great job tuning out ambient noise. In my testing, it wasn&apos;t as effective as the Ear 2, but it is definitely useful if you&apos;re in a noisy environment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QrpFLfB3vNYhx5rHCt35TH" name="nothing-cmf-buds-2.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QrpFLfB3vNYhx5rHCt35TH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I also like is that the Buds have a lot of extras that you don&apos;t usually see in this segment; there&apos;s IP54 ingress protection, multi-device pairing, and in-ear detection. The only downside to the design is that the gesture controls are still finicky, and that&apos;s been an issue on all Nothing earbuds I used up to this point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dMdrSxCh8DwJ48bkYGaAFJ" name="nothing-cmf-buds-3.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMdrSxCh8DwJ48bkYGaAFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest reason to buy the CMF Buds is the sound quality, and there is a lot to like in this area. The earbuds have a distinctly bass-focused sound that delivers an energetic low-end — so much so that it spills over into the mid-range. The bass is heavy and domineering, but on the bright side, the earbuds sound fantastic with bass-heavy tunes. So if that&apos;s the sort of sound signature you&apos;re after, you should just get these; I liken the CMF Buds to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 2</a> in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4VfUrJaVFVi2vyHozaGqH" name="nothing-cmf-buds-4.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4VfUrJaVFVi2vyHozaGqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don&apos;t like the low-end to dominate the sound, you can tweak the sound signature (to an extent) via Nothing X, and doing so creates a slightly more balanced sound that lends itself well to most mainstream music. You don&apos;t quite get the same tonality or refinement as the Ear 2, but for what you&apos;re ultimately paying, the CMF Buds are among the best-sounding earbuds in this segment.</p>
<p>The CMF Buds are Nothing&apos;s most affordable earbuds yet, and while I haven&apos;t used the Buds Pro, I think the regular Buds are a great starting point into the brand&apos;s ecosystem. With Nothing set to announce a CMF-branded phone in the coming weeks, it is clear that the entry-level segment is where the brand sees the biggest differentiation. For now, if you need budget earbuds with a good design and bass-heavy sound, you&apos;ll like what the CMF Buds have to offer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Creative doesn&apos;t have a huge presence in western markets, but it is a major player in Asia. The Sound Blaster series has a rich heritage of delivering standout audio products at a good value, and it started out making sound cards that could be plugged into a PCIe interface. I have fond memories of using the Sound Blaster X-Fi Fatal1ty sound cards back in college, and the brand has diversified into a host of new categories in recent years.</p><p>In what is a natural evolution, Creative makes Sound Blaster DACs these days, and the X5 is the brand&apos;s most ambitious offering yet. The X5 contains two Cirrus Logic CS43198 DACs and custom amps that allow it to effortlessly power any headset, including demanding planar options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F9TjSRfVpTEDnwsRkh7LmK" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-2.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9TjSRfVpTEDnwsRkh7LmK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Sound Blaster X5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-External-Headphone-Bluetooth-Audiophiles/dp/B0BHYSCCH7">retails for $295 on Amazon</a>, and that puts it squarely in the range of most mid-range DACs sold by Chinese brands. I think Creative backed itself into a corner with the X5, because even though it has a lot of custom features that you don&apos;t get in other DACs, it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to its immediate rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kmwKdJ669ByGZQBRpP7dmF" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-3.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmwKdJ669ByGZQBRpP7dmF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s evident in the design. The X5 has a plastic build and a front fascia that&apos;s <em>busy </em>with buttons and ports, with a large volume dial on the right. There&apos;s a screen that shows connection details and playback information, and you get dedicated 3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced connections alongside a mic in option that signals the brand&apos;s gaming-focused underpinnings.</p>
<p>You get toggles to adjust the gain, switch between PC and console, configure the EQ, DSP, and switch sources between the ports at the front and those at the back. There&apos;s even a knob to adjust the volume of the mic, and a mute button. Clearly, a lot of attention went into the feature-set of the X5, and it isn&apos;t lacking in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LrRkTQqqhwAgdzFxbKBXVG" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-6.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LrRkTQqqhwAgdzFxbKBXVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, you get optical in/out, along with RCA in and out and USB-C as well as USB-A connectivity. What I like about the X5 is that it can be powered via the USB bus, so there isn&apos;t any need to connect it to an external power source. This versatility means you can use it with just about any device, and that&apos;s why there&apos;s a toggle to switch it to console mode up front.</p>

<p>And while the build quality is decent enough, the plastic chassis is noticeably light, and that&apos;s not what you want in a DAC. It doesn&apos;t feel as sturdy as other DACs, and Creative should have used a metal enclosure here — just like every other DAC manufacturer. Even $150 DACs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k5-pro-review">Fiio K5 Pro</a> feel much more sturdy as a result, and although the X5 has rubber feet at the bottom, the unit moves around when you&apos;re connecting IEMs or headsets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eAGURqYXe8fAGsiQn8fb5J" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-10.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAGURqYXe8fAGsiQn8fb5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I connected the X5 to my Windows machine via USB-C, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this regard. But what&apos;s annoying is that the volume knob is tied to the Windows volume, so if you manually change the volume in Windows, it doesn&apos;t translate to the device. To make things even more confusing, Creative doesn&apos;t show Windows volume on the panel, instead highlighting the decibel level. Ultimately, it just makes changing the volume convoluted than it needs to be.</p>
<p>When it comes to the sound quality itself, the X5 has a lot to offer. The DAC has a neutral signature and allows headsets and IEMs to shine, but this being Creative, you get adjustable EQ and a good selection of preset modes that change the dynamics of the sound to a significant degree. This isn&apos;t usually a feature you get on many DACs, but if you want easy configurability of the sound, the X5 has plenty to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sUAyi4YzmgwKtsVUPeaKZH" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-9.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sUAyi4YzmgwKtsVUPeaKZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the X5 has Bluetooth connectivity, and there&apos;s a dedicated button that kicks the unit into pairing mode. Connecting via Bluetooth is about as easy as it gets, but the main issue in this area is that it doesn&apos;t have any AptX codecs or LDAC, so you&apos;re limited to SBC and AAC. Other Bluetooth-enabled DACs in this segment offer at least a few high-res codecs as standard.</p>
<p>The X5 delivers 313mW of power at 150Ω, and while that isn&apos;t as high as other DACs — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k7-review">Fiio&apos;s K7</a> goes up to 500mW at 300Ω — it is enough to drive just about any headset. On the whole, I didn&apos;t see any issues with the sound itself, and the customizability is a key differentiator.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="67po7Np3uM9YkwunQcE3iJ" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-12.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/67po7Np3uM9YkwunQcE3iJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, my current recommendation in the sub-$300 segment is the Fiio K7; there&apos;s a Bluetooth-enabled version of the DAC that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K7BT-Bluetooth-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B0C3HHCTJC">costs $249 on Amazon</a>, and it has a much better design with a metal chassis, sounds great, and includes all the connectivity options you want.</p><p>Overall, Creative got a lot right with the Sound Blaster X5, but by positioning it at the $300 mark, the brand essentially priced itself out of contention. With plenty of other options available at this price point, I don&apos;t really see why anyone would choose the X5 — unless you need a DAC that can be powered straight via the USB bus or want to use one with the PS5. Outside of these use cases, you&apos;re better off going with Fiio, Schiit, or SMSL.</p>

<hr>
<p>We’re nearing Samsung’s typical summer Galaxy Unpacked event, and we expect to see the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">new foldable phones</a> debut. There are a lot of leaks and rumors surrounding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/forget-rumors-this-is-our-closest-look-at-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-in-real-world">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 6, including what features and changes might arrive soon. However, according to known leaker Ice Universe in a post on X (formerly Twitter), camera upgrades might not be coming on the Z Fold 6. If true, that would mean the brand-new Galaxy Z Fold 6 would ship with the exact same camera hardware as the two-year-old Z Fold 4.</p><p>That would be devastating news for fans of Samsung’s folding phones. Even when the Galaxy Z Fold 4 was brand new, it still lagged behind the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> in terms of camera hardware. For example, the Z Fold 4 and Z Fold 5 only support 3x optical zoom via the 10MP telephoto sensor. By comparison, the Galaxy S24 Ultra uses a periscope lens for 50MP, 5x optical zoom. </p><p>We’ve been waiting years for foldables to appear on the spec sheets and compete with their flagship counterparts. If this Ice Universe leak turns out to be accurate, users will have to wait beyond the Galaxy Z Fold 6 release. “All its camera specifications, including front camera, rear camera, UPC, and aperture value, are exactly the same,” the leaker claims. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing that many people still don't know the camera specifications of Galaxy Z Fold6.I'll emphasize it once,All its camera specifications, including front camera, rear camera, UPC and aperture value, are exactly the same, and there is no change.Exactly like Fold4 and Fold5.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1799271371832484148">June 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Foldable phones already cost about double the price of a standard flagship. The regular Galaxy S24 costs $800, while the current Z Fold 5 costs $1,800. The high prices were acceptable in the beginning, but as we near the sixth generation of Samsung foldables, the bubble has to burst. Either prices need to come down, or hardware needs to match that of regular flagship phones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qjoT7qHMLGmweQtVLSLssJ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-vs-google-pixel-fold-outer-displays-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the outer display size between the Google Pixel Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qjoT7qHMLGmweQtVLSLssJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Galaxy Z Fold 6 doesn’t include major upgrades, it wouldn’t be the first time a foldable fell short of competing with regular flagships. In fact, that has been the norm since foldables were introduced, especially concerning those released in the U.S.</p><p>Last year’s Galaxy Z Fold 5 was virtually unchanged from the prior Z Fold 4, only adding a new hinge and a chip upgrade. It still has a narrow cover screen that makes it hard to use the phone when closed, and the cameras just don’t stack up to flagship cameras. It’s thick, too. There are quite a few compromises you make when picking up the Galaxy Z Fold 5, although you’re paying a lump sum to own one. </p><p>The Pixel Fold might just be worse. Google announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2"> Tensor G2 chip</a> that powers the Pixel Fold in October 2022, and it was already half a year old when it debuted in the foldable phone in May 2023. The Pixel Fold only had the newest chip for about five months before Google replaced the Tensor G2 with an upgraded G3 version in October 2023. This is significant because Tensor G3 was bad in a lot of ways, from overall performance to thermal issues that caused overheating. And yet, if you buy Google’s most expensive phone today, you’ll get the aging Tensor G2 chip. </p><p>OnePlus did things a bit better with the Open, though it, too, had timing issues. Qualcomm announced the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform on the exact same day as the OnePlus Open became available. There wasn’t a single day when the OnePlus Open had the newest phone chip, even though it cost $1,700. Even though the rest of the OnePlus Open’s hardware is great, reports indicate we won’t get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> this year. That means the OnePlus Open will drift further away from flagships until it receives an update.</p>

<p>People who buy foldable phones are enthusiasts willing to pay top dollar for a premium experience. By not doing everything they can to improve foldable hardware, tech companies are doing a disservice to their best customers. </p>
<h2 id="competition-should-push-samsung-to-really-innovate-foldables-2">Competition should push Samsung to really innovate foldables</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-v2-rsr-16.jpg" alt="Porsche Design Honor Magic V2 RSR review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are consequences to companies’ approaches to foldable phones sold in the U.S. Stagnating innovation, driving people away from brands like Samsung and pushing them to others that provide a better experience. In a report covering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-foldable-market-share-q1-2024">Q1 2024 foldable phone shipments</a>, it was revealed that Huawei beat Samsung for the first time ever in moved units. Plus, competitors Honor and Motorola are finding success outside of China. </p><p>Samsung needs a big win to rebound and prove it’s still the leader in the folding phone market. We still don’t know what the Galaxy Z Fold 6 holds, and it’s entirely possible Samsung will surprise us with something outstanding. But if the leaks are right, it’ll be another underwhelming year for Samsung foldables. That might just push more people to buy traditional flagships again or look outside the North American market to get a better product. </p>

<p>Wireless charging has been around for a while now, but it varies vastly between brands and products. The number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-android-phones-can-handle-wireless-charging">Android phones that support the feature</a> as a whole has multiplied greatly. Samsung and Google phones usually offer very low wireless charging speeds, whereas brands like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and OPPO push the very boundaries of what can and cannot be achieved wirelessly speaking.</p><p>For years, heck, maybe even since the inception of wireless charging, we tech journos, bloggers, and reviewers have been guilty of writing off the lack of the feature as a glaring con. Any time a flagship device does not have wireless charging capabilities, we write this down as a major disadvantage of the device, but maybe it&apos;s time we adjust that thinking.</p><p>And it&apos;s not just phones that glorify wireless charging. Everything from wireless earbuds to Bluetooth speakers and power banks have ditched wires to charge and recharge these days.</p>

<p>As a person who tests phones and accessories for a living, I love weighing out the pros and cons in terms of features and specs of devices. It makes it incredibly easy to weigh out the benefits and drawbacks of things you&apos;re looking to buy but aren&apos;t sure which exact model to go with.</p><p>Unfortunately, this can also be a problematic way to make decisions at times when we end up giving way too much importance to selective features as opposed to the overall value or price.</p><p>When it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, the basics that we compare and contrast include a general list of the main specs to pit against other options. Here&apos;s a rundown of those things in general:</p>
<ul><li>Price</li><li>Display</li><li>Processor</li><li>Memory</li><li>Battery</li><li>Charging</li><li>Camera</li><li>Software updates</li></ul>
<p>Arguably, everything else is secondary to these primary specs. Oftentimes, the best flagship phones have cutting-edge internals and there&apos;s a fine line between your top contenders. That&apos;s when you start to look at the other factors in play, and that includes wireless charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1593px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="KWvqQ4iNXmZtMNJkxQso5D" name="google-pixel-7-pro-and-pixel-7-wireless-charging-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Taking a look at the Google Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, and Pixel Watch at the Google Fall 2022 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KWvqQ4iNXmZtMNJkxQso5D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1593" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I myself have always prioritized wireless charging and don&apos;t hold back my criticism when a top-of-the-line phone or accessory doesn&apos;t support it. Recently, however, I have started to question my priorities.</p><p>Having used Google and Samsung phones as my primary mobile devices for the last few years, I became pretty used to having wireless charging support. I switched over to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> as my main device a few months back and it completely changed my perspective on the matter.</p><p>When I switched from a high-end Samsung Galaxy to a budget OnePlus device, I had many anxious thoughts. And I&apos;ll be honest: I judged the OnePlus 12R pretty hard for not having wireless charging capabilities. I was so worried that I would be missing out on a big feature that I had become so used to.</p><p>But as I got accustomed to my new primary phone, I began to realize my fears were completely misguided. Since the 12R has such an incredible battery life and boasts a mighty 100W SUPERVOOC charging speed, I hardly need to charge it more than once in two days. Equipped with such spectacular battery and charging specs, I eventually forgot about my dependency on wireless charging.</p><p>This also gave me insight into the value of wireless charging. If your phone lasts long enough, you don&apos;t need to place it on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">wireless charger</a> to keep it topped off throughout the day. Cables or no cables, charging isn&apos;t the most important chore for me anymore.</p><p>What I have always loved about wireless charging was the fact that I don&apos;t need to fumble around with cables as much. But when you&apos;re not really charging your phone as often, plugging it in to recharge isn&apos;t such a big deal anymore.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sYKAUY9msVFJPKEdyX4GcP" name="oneplus-12r-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sYKAUY9msVFJPKEdyX4GcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, the OnePlus 12R made me realize that I can live without wireless charging. This is now making me question whether we even really need it in our lives. Maybe we have lost the plot and placed too much value on wireless charging as a feature.</p><p>Perhaps it makes sense when you&apos;ve got a stunningly fast 50W or 60W wireless charging speed or higher, but you top out at 15W to 25W with most flagships from Samsung and Google. In that case, I now think that it&apos;s better to have a faster wired charging speed as opposed to a measly and inefficient wireless charging speed.</p><p>I was very curious about the demand for wireless charging and whether average citizens seek it out as much. I reached out to Anker, one of the largest charging accessory brands in the world, to inquire about the demand for wireless chargers as a reflection of this. The brand&apos;s answers weren&apos;t surprising.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>According to Anker, the growth rate of wireless chargers is faster compared to regular old wired chargers.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>According to Anker, the growth rate of wireless chargers is faster compared to regular old wired chargers. The growth rate of the entire wireless market in 2023 went up by more than 80% compared to 2022. The Chinese company went on to comment on the increased demand for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe</a> wireless chargers in particular.</p><p>"Anker wireless has achieved remarkable results in the market. Our multiple magnetic wireless charging products have entered the top ten of the &apos;Best Seller&apos; list in Amazon and are among the best-selling wireless chargers for mobile phones, including the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Charging Station and MagGo Wireless Foldable Charging Station. Among them, the MagGo Wireless Foldable Charging Station is the only product in the top ten of the best-selling list with a price above $100."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GyuRxpmpQpNeD9fewjVe7d" name="Anker-MagGo-Power-Bank-6-6K-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GyuRxpmpQpNeD9fewjVe7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3392" height="1908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn&apos;t surprising, seeing as how more and more devices now support wireless charging. Factor in MagSafe and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2</a> being on the horizon, and you can see why more and more people want to ditch cables. It&apos;s just easier to plop on a magnetic wireless charger and go about your day. However, it&apos;s still not the fastest or most efficient way to recharge your phones and accessories.</p><p>At the end of the day, I remain firm in my newfound belief that wireless charging should not be over-prioritized as a feature. Sure, it&apos;s a nice spec to have and it&apos;s convenient. But it&apos;s not very useful if it&apos;s not blazing fast or up to par with a phone&apos;s wired charging capabilities.</p><p>We can hype wireless charging, but only if it&apos;s miraculously fast and beating current wired charging speeds. Xiaomi, OPPO, and OnePlus have proven to us that this is easily possible. But if popular brands like Samsung and Google continue giving us expensive flagships with stupidly slow 15W wireless charging speeds, it&apos;s a dumb feature to have. At that point, it&apos;s hardly even a feature. It&apos;s basically just an on-paper spec that saves the brand&apos;s face.</p><p>Be honest, what would you rather have: A phone with 100W or higher wired <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charging</a> that takes about 20 minutes to go from zero to a hundred percent, or a device with so-so 45W wired charging and a snail&apos;s pace 15W wireless charging speed?</p>

<hr>
<p>We might be able to better understand what could be in store, camera array- wise in the upcoming OnePlus 13, thanks to a new leak.</p><p>Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OiujWDjV5">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) states that the OnePlus 13 could take its ultrawide and periscope lenses up a notch with new Sony sensors (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-camera-leak-3450496/">Android Authority</a>). The tipster states that both lenses could feature Sony&apos;s IMX882 sensor. It&apos;s worth noting that this is the same sensor OnePlus popped into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3v-goes-official-in-china">Ace 3V</a>, which launched earlier this year.</p><p>The sensor provides 50MP strength, meaning the OnePlus 13&apos;s auxiliary lenses might see a worthy upgrade. The post states that the periscope lens could continue to offer 3x optical zoom.</p><p>The OnePlus 13&apos;s main camera isn&apos;t rumored to see any changes, as the tipster states it will continue to feature the Sony IMX808 lens.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the upcoming iteration will likely offer 50MP on its primary shooter.</p>

<p>Information about the OnePlus 13 has continued to surface little by little, with the latest round highlighting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-charging-display-upgrade-leak">missing charging feature</a>. Unlike its soon-to-be predecessor, the OnePlus 13 might miss out on wireless charging capabilities. However, its battery could grab a boost as those rumors suggested a 6,000mAh battery, up from 5,400mAh, with 100W wired fast charging.</p><p>Also, those rumors from earlier in June teased an "upgraded" periscope triple camera setup, which we&apos;ve now seen in detail. The OnePlus 13 might continue to feature a 6.8-inch display. However, it could benefit from its 2K 8T LTPO specifications.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is rumored to rock the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-power-hungry-rumor">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> SoC once it&apos;s out. Moreover, there&apos;s speculation that the company could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-oneplus-13-leaks-point-to-redesign-and-upgraded-fingerprint-sensor">revamp its back panel</a>, shifting its circular camera array to the center instead of off on the left side. Some quick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-oneplus-13r-likely-to-look-different-in-design">barebones sketches</a> suggested what the device could look like, alongside a potential change for the 13R.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Evan Blass has revealed the color options for the upcoming Galaxy foldables.</li><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is to come in navy, pink, silver shadow, and white, with crafted black to be sold as an online exclusive.</li><li>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 adds a new peach color alongside mint and yellow options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy Unpacked event might be weeks away, and we will get to see the latest Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 models. While we may already know a lot about the foldables, thanks to numerous leaks, new information from Evan Blass gives us the colorways to expect that they will likely ship with.</p><p>Blass took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> color options sporting in navy, pink, and silver shadow. On the other hand, the clamshell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is likely to showcase blue, mint, silver shadow, and yellow color variants. Additionally, exclusive color options for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 may include white and crafted black. The Z Flip 6 may have these two options next to a new peach color.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ICYMI, the upcoming Z-series foldables will be sold in the following colors:Flip6: blue, mint, silver shadow, & yellow.Fold6: navy, pink, & silver shadow.In addition, both models will be offered exclusively online in white and crafted black, with the Flip6 also adding peach.<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1800350538967785483">June 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> came in blue, cream, gray, icy blue, and phantom black. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> featured blue, cream, graphite, gray, green, lavender, mint, and yellow. </p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time we have heard about the colorways; in fact, a couple of months ago, display analyst Ross Young also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-storage-color-options-leak">shared the color options</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">upcoming foldables</a>, which sound familiar to what we are hearing from Blass.</p>

<p>According to Young, a few existing color options will be rebranded with new names; for instance, the blue color of the Z Fold 6 will be called navy this year. Similarly, the green from the current Z Flip 5 will be dubbed mint. That said, the new ones to look forward to are likely the new pink for the book-style foldable and the peach option for the clamshell phone, which could be similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Fuzz color on the Razr Plus</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, fancy names are usually part of Samsung&apos;s marketing strategy, and we&apos;ll likely hear more about availability when the devices launch, which is anticipated to happen on July 10.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-amazon-prime-day-2024-2">When is Amazon Prime Day 2024?</h2>
<p>Although Amazon hasn&apos;t specified exact dates just yet, the retailer has confirmed that Prime Day will run sometime in July. Last year&apos;s 48-hour sale event occurred on July 11th and 12th, while Prime Day 2022 ran from the 12th through the 13th. </p><p>Assuming Amazon doesn&apos;t make any drastic changes, it seems likely that the sale will be scheduled for either the week of July 8th or the week of July 15th. We&apos;ll update this page as soon as we learn more. </p>
<h2 id="what-tv-deals-can-i-expect-during-prime-day-2">What TV deals can I expect during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale is arguably the best time of the year to buy a new smart TV. Mainstream brands from LG and Samsung to Insignia and onn. will be dropping historic discounts on their most popular models, so if you can wait until next month to order a smart TV, we recommend it. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-2">Do I need to be a Prime member?</h2>
<p>Prime Day is reserved exclusively for Prime members, so if you want to take part in the sale, you&apos;ll need to sign up. Fortunately, Amazon offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a> that you can cancel at any time, so if you don&apos;t want to join for good, you could feasibly sign up on July 1st, enjoy all of the Prime Day festivities, and cancel once the sale ends without paying a dime. </p><p>If you don&apos;t want to join Prime or take advantage of the free trial, the goods news is that many of Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors are likely to offer rival sales that run concurrent to Prime Day without requiring a membership. Needless to say, we&apos;ll be sharing <em>all </em>of the best deals from across the web during those 48 hours, not just Amazon&apos;s offerings. </p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-smart-tv-2">What should I look for in a smart TV?</h2>
<p>When you&apos;re shopping for smart TVs, you&apos;ll immediately notice that manufacturers throw a bunch of impressive-sounding jargon in your face to make their models seem more appealing. Some of this information is <em>actually </em>important, while other details are just filling space. To cut through the noise, we&apos;ve gathered a few of the most important things to worry about when making your final decision. </p>
<ul><li><strong>1. Resolution: </strong>Although TVs with 8K resolution are starting to be released, they're quite expensive, and most TV shows and films aren't made to support that resolution anyway. For now, you can save some money and have a nearly-identical experience by going with a 4K TV. If you want all of your favorite shows and films to look as good as possible, look for a set with 4K upscaling.  </li><li><strong>2. Refresh rate:</strong> To put it simply, a TV's refresh rate will affect how smooth and lifelike moving images appear on your display, whether you're watching live sports or playing video games. 60Hz is generally fine for smaller TVs, but 120Hz is even better, especially if your TV is larger than 60 inches. Some TVs may even come with a game optimization mode that boosts the refresh rate up to 240Hz. </li><li><strong>3. OLED vs. LCD: </strong>Despite all of the many proprietary varieties touted by manufacturers (QLED, ULED, etc), all you need to know is that smart TVs are broken down into two categories: LCD and OLED. LCD technology is generally found in more-affordable TVs and looks pretty great most of the time. If you can afford it, however, OLED makes a big difference in larger TVs, with consistently richer colors and better contrast. Technologies such as Samsung's "QLED" and Hisense's "ULED" are basically just marketing terms used to describe the companies' proprietary takes on LCD. Rule of thumb: if you have over $1,000 to spend on a TV, go OLED; otherwise, an LCD with 4K support should be just fine. </li><li><strong>4. Price: </strong>Smart TVs are some of the only pieces of tech that haven't gotten more expensive in recent years. Depending on the size you need, you could probably get away with spending $500 or less on a great 4K TV for your home. Don't be fooled by all of the high-tech jargon: as long as the reviews seem consistent and the TV comes with 4K resolution, a refresh rate over 60Hz, and three or four HDMI ports, you should be all set. </li></ul>
<h2 id="what-size-smart-tv-should-i-get-2">What size smart TV should I get?</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re trying to figure out which size TV you should buy, the first thing to know is that the size of a TV is determined by measuring one corner of the screen to another. Take a tape measure and hold it "corner to corner" in the space you&apos;re hoping to place your new smart TV and consider how far away you&apos;ll be sitting from the screen. For example, if you&apos;re sitting around six feet away from your TV screen, a 50-inch to 70-inch TV should be sufficient. </p>

<ul><li>A report from an inside source claims that Spotify will launch its new HiFi music tier as an "add-on" for an extra $5 monthly for existing users "later this year."</li><li>The plan will reportedly bring "new tools" for unique playlist creations that "learn and adapt" to users alongside song library management options.</li><li>Spotify recently announced its plans to raise prices across the board for its users in July.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new report suggests that Spotify is (actually) planning on debuting its new "HiFi" music tier at some point this year.</p><p>Citing an unnamed person close to the matter, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-11/spotify-to-introduce-more-expensive-subscription-tier-for-music-lovers?leadSource=uverify%20wall&embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> states that Spotify is working to launch its HiFi tier to users "later this year" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/11/spotify-hifi-add-on-5-dollars/">9to5Google</a>). The publication&apos;s source added that Spotify will turn its HiFi music plan into an "add-on" so existing customers can get in on the higher-quality tunes.</p><p>This add-on will reportedly charge users an extra $5 monthly. The source claims that the pricing "will vary depending on each user’s base plan." However, this is said to "average" out for a 40% increase no matter which plan users are adding HiFi on top of.</p><p>This new HiFi plan will reportedly bring "new tools" for playlist creation and song library management. Users may be able to create playlists through HiFi for specific dates, times of the year, and "certain activities."</p><p>Additionally, these unique playlists will supposedly be able to "learn and adapt" to their users.</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting on Spotify&apos;s HiFi music tier for quite a while and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-lossless-audio-expectation-leak">a leak from May</a> teased what we could expect from its launch. For its Lossless audio quality, it seems Spotify will inform users if their device is compatible and how much bandwidth the quality setting is soaking up.</p><p>The leak also showed that the company could push Spotify Connect on users as the "best way" to enjoy their music.</p><p>Also, when it comes to pricing, the picture is a little clearer after we dig into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotifys-price-hikes-and-lack-of-hifi-make-me-want-to-own-music-again">the price hike</a> slated for July. A week ago, Spotify announced that it would raise prices for the Premium individual plan by $1, bringing it to $11.99 monthly. The Premium Duo plan is rising by $2 to $16.99 while the Premium Family plan jumps by $3 to $19.99.</p><p>If Bloomberg&apos;s source is true, and HiFi will land as a $5 add-on, then users could see their monthly bills at $16.99 if they own the individual plan at the start.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>AT&T deals have been really growing on me lately, namely because the Big Three carrier keeps dropping offers that give you dirt cheap (or even free) devices without requiring a trade-in. As someone who writes about deals every day, that&apos;s music to my ears. Case in point: you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/google-pixel-8a.html"><strong>buy the brand new Google Pixel 8a for a mere $2.99 per month</strong></a> when you add a qualifying data plan to your AT&T wireless account. As if that wasn&apos;t good enough, if you add an additional service line for a smartwatch, you can get the Google Pixel Watch 2 for 100% free. I don&apos;t know how AT&T does it, but I&apos;m certainly not complaining. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> has only been out for a few weeks, but we've already been impressed by the midrange device's powerful camera tech and flagship-level performance. Purchase and activate the Pixel 8a with a qualifying data plan at AT&T and the carrier will give you the phone for only $2.99/month for 36 months. That's over $400 in savings, no trade-in required!</p>
<p>To make the deal even sweeter, AT&T will also give you a free Google Pixel Watch 2 when you bundle the watch with your new smartphone. All you need to do is add an additional service line. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/google-pixel-8a.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="15042a91-81c0-4b96-b224-7693347a0fd3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 8a 128GB: $519.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 8a 128GB: $519.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;re an AT&T customer or ready to switch; you want flagship-quality camera technology and fancy AI features for cheap. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;re happy with your current phone plan or can afford to buy the Pixel 8a unlocked; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in deal. </p><p>Of course, like most carrier deals, there&apos;s a lot of fine print to consider before hopping on board. Like I mentioned above, you&apos;ll need to sign up for one of AT&T&apos;s qualifying unlimited plans to get the huge discount on the Pixel 8a. These start at $75.99 for one line, although it&apos;s worth noting that you can stack discounts (like for multiple lines, AARP members, students, and more) without losing eligibility. Additionally, both new and existing AT&T customers can receive the savings, which is a pretty rare incentive when it comes to mainstream carrier deals. </p><p>All things said and done, if you can meet the fairly flexible eligibility requirements, you&apos;ll end up with a sweet midrange device that boasts a gorgeous 120Hz display, loads of software support, and some of the best camera tech found on any Android phone to date — all for the price of a cup of coffee every month. And that&apos;s before you even consider the free Google Pixel Watch 2 that you&apos;ll get when you add another service line (starting at $10.99 per month).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/the-best-atandt-deals-of-month-year-up-to-dollar1000-off-galaxy-s24-ultra-free-flagships-and-more">AT&T deals</a> like this don&apos;t come around very often, so if you&apos;re interested in the new Google Pixel 8a and ready to make a change to your wireless service, don&apos;t miss this opportunity. </p>
