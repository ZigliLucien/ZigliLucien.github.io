Whether or not it&apos;s your first flip phone, setting up a new phone can be a daunting task, and even more so when the device has two screens. Fortunately, we&apos;re here to make the setup process a bit easier by showing you the first things you should definitely do once you move all your data over and are taken to the home screen for the first time.</p><p>Of course, we recommend you look through all the settings to get a full understanding of what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> can do, but these should put you in a pretty good place.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-adjust-the-display-colors"><span>Adjust the display colors</span></h2>
<p>One of the first things I like to do when setting up a phone is make sure the display is set to my liking. While many phones come with just two display settings for color reproduction, the new Motorola Razr Plus 2024 has three, giving you a little more control over your viewing experience.</p><p>Visit the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and select <strong>Display</strong>. Navigate to <strong>Colors</strong>, where you&apos;ll be met with three options: Natural, Radiant, and Vivid. These are laid out in order of how saturated the colors will appear, so Natural is a bit more muted while Vivid is heavily saturated and Radiant is somewhere in between.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="dbA3NiAXhQ4Mz4WoxpYF5g" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-display-colors.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 display color settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbA3NiAXhQ4Mz4WoxpYF5g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you select your preferred display mode, navigate to the bottom of the page, where you&apos;ll find a <strong>color wheel</strong>. This allows you to further adjust the temperature of the display, which can affect how the phone&apos;s color theme appears. To make it easy, there are also preselected options at the bottom, which includes Warm, Cool, and Custom, although you&apos;re always welcome to leave it at Default.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-control-panel-style"><span>Change control panel style</span></h2>
<p>With Motorola&apos;s new Hello UI, the company has switched up some of the various UI elements of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. However, the Control Center, where you&apos;ll find your quick settings toggles, will appear the same when you first turn it on. What Motorola doesn&apos;t tell you is that you can change how this looks to give it a more modern look.</p><p>To switch to the new mode, navigate to the <strong>Settings menu</strong>, then select <strong>Home & lock screen</strong>. Tap <strong>Control Center</strong> and select <strong>Modern Style</strong>. Now, when you swipe down from the top left corner, you&apos;ll find your notifications. Swiping down from the top right corner will take you to a fullscreen control center with permanent toggles for display brightness, volume, and connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="DSJsKmPPfMniR54d2kYqTf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-modern-control-center.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 modern control center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DSJsKmPPfMniR54d2kYqTf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tap the <strong>pencil icon</strong> in the top right corner and hit <strong>Edit quick settings</strong> to enable more toggles and place them wherever you want.</p><p>While it might seem bothersome to swipe down from two different sides of the display, you can always swipe over between notifications and the Control Center for quick and easy access. There&apos;s also a handy setting that lets you swipe down on the power button to open the Control Panel.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-sidebar"><span>Set up the sidebar</span></h2>
<p>Motorola&apos;s flavor of Android has a lot of handy features, but among my favorites is the Sidebar, which allows you quick access to your most used apps with just a swipe. I would highly recommend this for power users such as myself.</p><p>Navigate to the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and <strong>Gestures</strong>. Select <strong>Sidebar</strong> and tap the toggle to <strong>Use sidebar</strong>, then tap the <strong>settings cog</strong> at the bottom. From here, you can select up to 20 apps, tools, and contacts to add to your sidebar and arrange them however you please.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="rMEKfydWwAVkAEwqtm8WLg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-sidebar-1.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 sidebar settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMEKfydWwAVkAEwqtm8WLg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One you select your apps, tools, and contacts, hit the <strong>settings cog</strong> at the top right for even <strong>More Settings</strong>. Here, you can choose how apps open—whether in full screen or in freeform mode (floating window), set the power key to open the sidebar when you double tap, choose how notifications open, and turn on vibration feedback.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="R54nG3LnxNWYGfHkK33Pjh" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-sidebar-2.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 sidebar settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R54nG3LnxNWYGfHkK33Pjh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once your sidebar is set, you&apos;ll see a small bar on the side of your display. Swiping it will open your sidebar, which is available on almost any screen aside from full-screen games and videos.</p><p>You can always adjust where the bar sits on the display so that you can reach it more easily. Just open the sidebar then touch and hold the bar at the top, which will let you drag and place it anywhere on the screen. The two options at the bottom of the bar let you open your full app drawer in a window or adjust your sidebar.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-sleep-display-and-aod"><span>Enable Sleep display and AOD</span></h2>
<p>Always-on Display is one of the more handy features on any smartphone, and Motorola has put its own spin on it with the addition of Sleep Display. This lets you quickly interact with the display while the phone is "asleep," so you can view notifications and media player controls.</p><p>To enable both, head to the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and navigate to <strong>Home & lock screen </strong>(this setting is also in the <strong>External display</strong> menu). Toggle <strong>Sleep display</strong> or tap on the option to open the menu. Here, you can enable the always-on display, which will work on both the internal and external displays (it will turn off when the phone is in your pocket or in battery-saving mode).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="S4u3RxJsRcZRC2F74Fvu6h" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-sleep-display-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 sleep display settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4u3RxJsRcZRC2F74Fvu6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also turn on various <strong>Sleep display</strong> options, like <strong>Tap to show</strong> or <strong>Approach to show</strong>, the latter of which will turn on the interactive display when your hand approaches the cover screen.</p><p>The AOD also extends to the new Desk display feature, which we&apos;ll get to next.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-and-customize-desk-display"><span>Enable and customize Desk display</span></h2>
<p>One of the unique things about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> is the fact that they, well... flip. You can open the display at various angles for different functions, one of which is Motorola&apos;s new Desk Display. With this, you can set the phone down in Tend or Stand mode and it will display a screensaver of sorts while the phone is idle.</p><p>Navigate to the <strong>External display</strong> option in <strong>Settings</strong> and tap <strong>Desk display</strong>. You&apos;ll see two different options for <strong>Tent</strong> and <strong>Stand</strong>. Tap either one and toggle the option at the top to <strong>Show info in tent/stand mode</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="5u5eUCzTCUTqwA6xRfPYff" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-desk-display-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 desk display settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u5eUCzTCUTqwA6xRfPYff.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, you can select the options for what you want to show on the display, such as a clock or a picture (preset or add your own), notification icons, and music album covers. You can also enable the approach gesture to show the lock screen when your hand moves close to the external display.</p><p>It&apos;s a great way to utilize the form factor, and the images that Motorola includes are often quite cute.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-customize-your-cover-screen"><span>Customize your cover screen</span></h2>
<p>Speaking of the cover screen, this is something you&apos;ll definitely want to take some time to set up. While you can do this from the cover screen itself, it will probably be easier to set up from the main display.</p><p>Head to the <strong>External display menu</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> to view all of your options. You can set separate wallpapers and themes for your home screen and lock screen, adjust the font and display size, set the phone to answer and hang up when you flip the phone open and closed, manage the music player screen, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="8Yn4rJXrXue9akFA3twDui" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-external-display-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Yn4rJXrXue9akFA3twDui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Panels is one of the more important options, as this gives you all the fun functions that lets you get the most out of your cover screen. Navigate here and enable any of the 12 available panels and rearrange them at the top in your preferred order.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve done that, close your phone and swipe through your panels to make sure they&apos;re to your liking. You may need to sign into apps like Spotify or enable synching with your preferred calendar.</p><p>You can also pinch the screen to see all your panels and delete or add more. Swiping down from the top will reveal your quick settings, and tapping the icons in the bottom left corner will reveal notifications, battery info, and media.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-cover-screen-apps"><span>Set up cover screen apps</span></h2>
<p>When setting up the cover screen, make sure to <strong>enable the Apps panel</strong>. Close the phone and <strong>navigate to the Apps panel</strong>, then tap the <strong>pencil icon</strong> in the top right corner to <strong>Manage apps</strong>. Select the apps that you want access to from the cover screen and tap the check mark to confirm your selections. Then, on the Apps panel, <strong>press and hold</strong> on the apps to move them around and arrange the panel how you want.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.39%;"><img id="XgCFe37NqoTBJzKTZgHgZj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cover-screen-apps.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgCFe37NqoTBJzKTZgHgZj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2310" height="1372" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You should also add app shortcuts to the cover screen home page. When on the home page, <strong>press and hold</strong> the display to open the editor. Tap <strong>Home screen</strong> and tap on one of the empty boxes to add an app, then hit <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom when you&apos;re finished. You have a limit of four app shortcuts for the home screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.39%;"><img id="MtbxiQmMBS8rajJJPhYS8k" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cover-screen-app-shortcuts.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen app shortcuts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MtbxiQmMBS8rajJJPhYS8k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2310" height="1372" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ll have a more in-depth look at how to set up and use apps on the cover screen, but this should get you started.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-moto-ai-to-create-a-new-wallpaper"><span>Use Moto AI to create a new wallpaper</span></h2>
<p>AI is the name of the game in 2024, and Motorola is getting a piece of the pie. While Google and Samsung both have a pretty similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI wallpaper</a> feature for Android 14, Motorola went in its own direction for the feature. The company has two different features you can select from to set up an AI wallpaper: Style Sync and Magic Canvas.</p><p>To access both, <strong>press and hold</strong> on the home screen and select <strong>Wallpapers</strong> in the menu. Tap <strong>Create with AI</strong> and select from either of the aforementioned options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="rbQcRXxadpQnse44U5zgri" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-style-sync.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 style sync AI wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbQcRXxadpQnse44U5zgri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="hQXozew9bCHQ4ovnA2QtRk" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-magic-canvas.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 magic canvas AI wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hQXozew9bCHQ4ovnA2QtRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With <strong>Style Sync</strong>, you&apos;ll be prompted to <strong>take a photo or upload one</strong>. When you do, it will analyze the image and give you a few options of wallpapers based on the colors or patterns.</p><p>With <strong>Magic Canvas</strong>, you <strong>type in a prompt</strong>, and the phone will attempt to create an artistic image based on your text.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-toggle-auto-camcorder-mode"><span>Toggle Auto camcorder mode</span></h2>
<p>Motorola has a number of fun camera modes you should play around with, but one of them is Auto Camcorder Mode, which lets you take advantage of the folding form factor when holding the phone at an angle to shoot video.</p><p>To enable this mode, <strong>open the camera</strong> and tap the <strong>settings cog</strong> in the right corner, then toggle on <strong>Auto Camcorder Mode</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:118.61%;"><img id="C5U8sZm94u599vFWBX8hbg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-Auto-Camcorder-Mode-settings.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 Auto Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5U8sZm94u599vFWBX8hbg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2310" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, when you fold the phone 90 degrees and flip it horizontally, the phone will count down from three and automatically start recording video, just like how you would hold an old-school video camera. It will also automatically show a live preview of the video on the cover screen, and you can even zoom in and out by moving your thumb across the bottom half of the display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.91%;"><img id="wRDbxYcYUA6Ja3bUcWiXtf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-Auto-Camcorder-Mode-UI.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 Auto Camcorder Mode UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wRDbxYcYUA6Ja3bUcWiXtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2640" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also quickly set the phone vertically while the countdown is still going to shoot a vertical video, which is perfect for social media. The only difference here is you won&apos;t have access to the zoom box at the bottom of the display, but that&apos;s likely because you&apos;ll probably be in front of the phone anyway when shooting vertically.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-smart-connect"><span>Set up Smart Connect</span></h2>
<p>Smart Connect is the equivalent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, allowing you to connect your phone to a PC or external display to turn it into a mobile desktop, simultaneously control your phone and other devices with a single mouse and keyboard, or seamlessly share content between your phone and your PC.</p><p>You can get started by opening the Smart Connect app and selecting a device type: PC, Tablet, or Display.</p><p>For PCs and tablets, you&apos;ll need to download the Smart Connect app onto the other device. For Displays, your phone will be able to connect to Miracast or Chromecast-enabled displays.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="nZHvaxmnV2t3VG4hGVSYif" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-smart-connect-add-device.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2024 Smart Connect app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nZHvaxmnV2t3VG4hGVSYif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is arguably the best flip phone you can buy this year, thanks to its flagship chipset, dual 50MP cameras, and large 4-inch cover screen. You can use nearly all your apps without opening your phone and the new camera really makes your selfies and portraits pop.</p></p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is Samsung's flagship foldable for 2024. It has the expected upgrades like the latest software, a mildly refreshed design, a newer processor, and a brighter display. Samsung has also given it an official IP48 rating this time. The rest of the specs haven't changed much, but it's now $100 more expensive than the Fold 5.</p></p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 4 is not easy to find today but if you still have one, it might be worth holding on to for a bit longer. The weight, thickness, and processor are the three main areas where it trails behind the new Fold 6. But it manages to come close or even match it everywhere else. It's even upgradable to One UI 6.1 which gives it Galaxy AI chops. Not bad for a two-year-old phone.</p></p>

<p>It&apos;s human nature to want the latest and greatest, and Samsung is banking on that to make its most expensive Fold device yet a big success. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 was recently announced during Samsung&apos;s Unpacked event in Paris, along with many other products. The Fold 6 features a tweaked design, a faster processor, and a few more changes, but largely remains the same as the Fold 5. It&apos;s more expensive though, starting at $1,899.99.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5">Compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, it&apos;s not something worth upgrading to in our opinion. But is it worth trading in your Z Fold 4 for it? The Fold 4 is now two years old and not easy to find brand new. If you do come across a good deal on one though or if you already own one, should you choose it over the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>? Let&apos;s find out what you&apos;ll be missing if you don&apos;t.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-galaxy-z-fold-4-design-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 4: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5CdQudR4ncWEEmChybQ7aj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-all-colors-01.jpg" alt="All three colors of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CdQudR4ncWEEmChybQ7aj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The physical appearance of both phones is the easiest way to tell the two apart. While the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 doesn&apos;t exactly reinvent the wheel, the more angular design and squared-off edges give it a more grown-up aesthetic. The sharper edges are probably not going to be the most comfortable to hold though, unless you&apos;re rocking one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases">best cases for the Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>The big change that everyone will undoubtedly love is that the Fold 6 is much slimmer and lighter than before. It&apos;s 3.7mm slimmer and 24g lighter than the Fold 4, which should make it much more comfortable to use in hand or when carrying in your pocket. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a>, the Fold 6 folds completely flush leaving no gap between the two halves. This isn&apos;t the case with the Fold 4, which leaves a wedge-like gap when folded.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CpPg2a7D6urv8XBd7XV5GS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-Graygreen-back-flex-07.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CpPg2a7D6urv8XBd7XV5GS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other big change is the IP48 rating in the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Z Fold 4</a> does have an IPX8 rating, but we&apos;ve been wanting some official dustproofing too for these expensive gadgets. Samsung finally delivered an official rating this year, but it&apos;s not quite what we were expecting. The number four in the rating of the Fold 6 only certifies ingress protection against solid particles larger than 1mm, and dust doesn&apos;t make the cut.</p><p>There&apos;s something charming about the Z Fold 4&apos;s curvy design. For one, it&apos;s comfortable to hold and the corners don&apos;t dig into your pocket. There&apos;s no getting around the thickness and weight though, although this is something you&apos;ll get used to after a while. It&apos;s just as sturdily built with glass all around and aluminum for the frame and hinge. The crease is quite prominent on this one, and can be felt when you run your fingers across the middle of the screen.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9ygQq5ebrvsJh4dZrhx3nT" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-s-pen-AI-doodle-01.jpg" alt="Using the AI doodle feature on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ygQq5ebrvsJh4dZrhx3nT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from design changes, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a brighter folding display. The peak brightness is now up to 2,600 nits, which is a big step up from the 1,200 nits on the Fold 4. The inner display of the Fold 6 also has proper corners in all four edges, compared to the rounded corners of the Fold 4. The outer and inner displays are also a tad bit wider, which is evident from the slight change in resolutions across both screens. The outer screen is now 6.3 inches, but it&apos;s still narrow by other foldable standards and not as roomy as the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> to facilitate comfortable typing.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 4 matches the Fold 6 in other areas. It too has a 7.6-inch folding display with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ playback support. The 6.2-inch cover display also has a 120Hz refresh rate and uses the slightly older but still good, Gorilla Glass Victus Plus treatment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4TNsEkUhhhrEk8BuieZv7L" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-split-keyboard-gboard-typing.jpg" alt="Using Gboard in split keyboard format on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4TNsEkUhhhrEk8BuieZv7L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other similarities continue with the cameras and battery. Both foldables use a 50MP primary sensor, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide. There&apos;s a 10MP selfie camera on the outer display, and a 4MP under-display camera on the folding screen. Camera capabilities are largely the same too, with the ability to capture up to 8K videos. The Fold 6 has slightly upgraded capabilities like 30fps recording at 8K.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has the same 4,400mAh battery capacity as the Fold 4, which is quite surprising and disappointing at the same time. Not that battery life was an issue with the Fold 4, but I wouldn&apos;t have minded a bit more heft in exchange for a larger battery in the 6. Sadly, charging speeds haven&apos;t budged at all. It&apos;s still 25W wired, and you have to buy the charger separately. The fingerprint sensor is still side-mounted, and U.S. models have Ultra Wideband (UWB) support.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 gets a nice performance boost with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy SoC. Qualcomm&apos;s latest chip is more powerful and power-efficient, which should result in better gaming and system performance on the Fold 6. The chip in the Fold 4 holds up well even today. The Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 fixed many of the heating and throttling issues of the 8 Gen 1, and is still good enough even for the current crop of Android games.</p><p>The amount of RAM and storage variants are similar across both models. 12GB of RAM and standard, and you can opt for 256GB, 512GB, or even 1TB of in-built storage. The software is a bit different, but maybe not for long. The Galaxy Z Fold 4 shipped with Android 12L, but it got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-4-fold-4-one-ui-6-rollout">Android 14 update in December 2023</a> and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">in line to get One UI 6.1.1</a> as well with more Galaxy AI features. This means, your two-year-old phone can still perform most of the new AI wizardry that Samsung has been touting.</p>

<p>Buying a new Galaxy Z Fold 4 right now is not easy as it&apos;s hard to find, unless you look at refurbished models or get a deal via your carrier. In any case, it wouldn&apos;t be prudent to put that sort of money on a new Z Fold 4 today, when the Z Fold 5 is a much more attractive offering.</p><p>If you already own a Z Fold 4 and are happy with the performance it&apos;s still delivering, there&apos;s still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-new-galaxy-z-fold-6">no need to upgrade to the Fold 6</a>. The changes made to the latest model are incremental at best. The lighter weight and slimmer design are definitely a step in the right direction, but beyond that, there&apos;s little that actually justifies the higher price.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 refines the design of the Fold even further, and it's now lighter and slimmer than ever before. Other than a brighter main display, faster SoC, and IP48 rating, not much else has changed in the new model, which makes the higher price tag a bit puzzling.</p></p>

<p>Samsung might have officially stopped selling the Z Fold 4, but it's still very relevant even today if you own one. It's going to continue to get software updates for the next few years, Galaxy AI features are coming to it too, and most of the specs are still similar to the Fold 6.</p></p>

<h2 id="should-you-use-an-older-galaxy-z-flip-5-case-on-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-2">Should you use an older Galaxy Z Flip 5 case on the Galaxy Z Flip 6?</h2>
<p>Even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> looks almost identical to the Galaxy Z Flip 5, refinements to the design make it so that many older cases may not properly fit the new phone, a tactic companies have used for a while to help drive sales of accessories. One example is the cameras, which are not physically larger thanks to the colored ring around the sensor. Many cases are designed for the exact dimensions of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 cameras, meaning they won&apos;t fit the Galaxy Z Flip 6 because of this.</p><p>Additionally, if you can find a case that properly fits around the cameras, the frame of these phones is different enough that the older cases will not fit snugly on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, even if it appears to. This is because the frame on the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is slightly curved on both ends toward the display and rear panels, and cases were designed to adhere to this curve.</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a completely flat frame, so there is a sharp angle where the frame and the back cover panel connect. This will cause cases to lift slightly off the body of the phone, as opposed to gripping the body tightly to provide the necessary protection.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to reuse older Galaxy Z Flip 5 cases, you should consider buying one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">best Galaxy Z Flip 6 cases</a> to properly protect your device. There are many to choose from, including first-party cases from Samsung, like the LED-powered Flipsuit case that lights up and automatically matches your cover screen to the design. There are also many third-party cases that you may like from our favorite brands like Thinborne, Caseology, and Spigen, and we would recommend looking at any of those as they may be cheaper than going for a first-party Samsung case.</p><p>While you&apos;re at it, we recommend buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-screen-protectors">Galaxy Z Flip 6 screen protector</a> to protect the cover screen from drops.

A ring that’s too big could potentially slide off your finger or won’t sit right. Meanwhile, one that’s too small will be tight and uncomfortable.</p><p>These considerations are even more important when it comes to a smart ring like the Samsung Galaxy Ring, which has sensors that need to come in contact with your skin without pressing too firmly against it. Thus, before you order a fancy new Samsung Galaxy Ring, it’s crucial to ensure that you order the right size.</p>

<p>In order to find the right Samsung Galaxy Ring size, you should use the official sizing kit.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-and-use-the-official-sizing-kit-2">How to get and use the official sizing kit</h2>
<p>Samsung offers an official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> sizing kit that you can order online, with limited inventory. It contains samples of all nine Samsung Galaxy Ring sizes that you can try on, well, for size. When you find one you think is right, keep it on for a full day, even overnight, to ensure it’s the proper fit. If not, try a size up or down as needed for another 24-hour period. You want to be sure it’s perfect and need to account for the fact that, especially with women, your finger size can fluctuate throughout the day and during specific times of the month.</p><p>If you don’t want to wait for the mailed kit, or none are available when you’re ready to order, some wireless carriers and retail stores have a sizing kit where you can visit and try it on in-store. You can also order the sizing kit from certain retailers, like Best Buy. It’s $10 but once you’re done with it and return it, you will receive an e-gift card to use towards the purchase of the Galaxy Ring itself.</p><p>Once you know your size, check for an e-mail sent by Samsung with a link to order the Galaxy Ring from there. You can also visit My Orders on Samsung’s e-shop to submit the size and finalize an order you might have already started.</p>
<h2 id="measure-at-home-2">Measure at home</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vuxANBDmumKmscVyp3ugjQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-hands-on-2.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vuxANBDmumKmscVyp3ugjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p> While it might not be 100% accurate, you can try to measure at home using either a ring you already own that fits perfectly, or a piece of string, ribbon, or twist tie and ruler to measure the circumference of your finger.</p><p>If you already know your ring size, use this to see where it corresponds in terms of the numerical size of the proper Samsung Galaxy Ring. But keep in mind that as a smart ring, the Samsung Galaxy Ring has small bumps on the underside for the health and fitness tracking sensors. The small protrusions mean that the measurements of the Samsung Galaxy Ring are slightly different than a standard, smooth-edged ring.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you’re determined to go this route, use a string, ribbon, or other similar item and wrap it around your finger. It should be snug but not too tight. Mark where the string ends, remove it from your finger, and measure the length with a ruler. From here, you can use a handy chart to determine what size corresponds with your ring circumference in millimeters.</p><p>A finger that’s 15.6mm in diameter, for example, would be a size 5; 18.2mm would be a size 8, and 22.2mm a size 13, with additional measurements in between. You might want to consider going a size up if you find that you’re right on the line, to account for the sensors.</p>
<h2 id="go-by-a-previous-smart-ring-2">Go by a previous smart ring</h2>

<p>If you’re not new to the smart ring game and you have owned one from another brand before, you can probably get something in the same size with the Samsung Galaxy Ring. All smart rings have some type of sensor and are similar in design, so the sizing should be relatively similar.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring comes in sizes from five through 13. It’s recommended to be worn on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-samsung-galaxy-ring-finger-is-best-to-wear">index finger of your non-dominant hand</a> to get the most accurate measurement, which means even if you know the size of your ring finger, it might not be the same as the index finger. Alternatively, you can also wear it on the middle finger, or the ring finger as a last option if you don’t find it comfortable on the index or middle finger. But it should not be worn on the pinky, which would likely be too small to generate an accurate reading, nor on the thumb, which could be too short and active to comfortably keep a ring on it 24/7.</p><p>While there are ways around it, your best bet to ensure that you get the right Samsung Galaxy Ring size off the bat is to order the sizing kit online.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is a powerful health and wellness tool on its own, but it’s ideally worn with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, both poised to be named the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung smartwatches</a>. They work in tandem with one another to present a more holistic and accurate picture of your health.</p>

<p>While the Oura Ring has been the leader in the smart ring category for some time, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is poised to give it a run for its money. It can monitor everything from heart rate to sleep, detect workouts, predict menstrual cycles, and most importantly, doesn’t require a subscription. Since you’ll be wearing it 24/7, including while sleeping, it’s crucial to get the right size.</p></p>

<p>Just because a new phone model has launched, it doesn’t mean users will flock to get it. If there is no significant difference in the specifications, you are more likely to stay with the phone model you have. But now that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is out, a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 4 comparison will help you see if it’s time to leave the older model behind.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is the latest flip phone from Samsung, and it has many changes that make it worth upgrading. This doesn’t mean that the Galaxy Z Flip 4 is obsolete, but the newer model has a clear advantage. But is it enough to warrant the upgrade? Let’s see which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> is worth your money.</p>

<p>In terms of design, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Flip 4 have clamshell designs with very similar measurements.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a matte aluminum frame, which makes it 10% more scratch-resistant. The Crafted Black color choice has a Kevlar-like design. It also comes with an enhanced Armor Aluminum frame with an IP48 rating, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">making it waterproof</a> for 30 minutes for up to 1.5 meters. Since it’s not entirely dust-proof, it&apos;s best not to expose it to dusty environments.</p><p>The latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 phone is available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">splashy colors</a>, such as Silver Shadow, Crafted Black, Yellow, and Mint Blue. The newer model measures 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm when closed and 165 x 71.9 x 6.9mm when open, making it 2mm thinner than the older model. You can also add some style to your phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">Z Flip 6 cases</a> like the Flipsuit, which gives your phone a unique design.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 has flat glass panels and a squared-off design. It offers a bevvy of color options, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-create-customized-bespoke-edition-galaxy-z-flip-4">Bespoken Edition</a>. The phone has an IPX8 rating (the same rating as the Flip 5), meaning it’s waterproof for 30 minutes and up to 1.5 meters, but it has no dustproof rating. This does not mean it’s not dustproof, but it indicates it did not go through testing. Unlike the newer model with the cameras beside one another, the Galaxy Z Flip 4 places its camera one on top of the other. The Flip 4 is slightly larger, measuring 84.9 x 71.9 x 15.9mm when closed and 165.2 x 71.9 x 6.9mm when open.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 4 face-off clearly shows a difference in the external display. The newer model allows you to do much more, saving you the trouble of opening your phone. The inner display hasn&apos;t changed much in the two generations since they share similar 6.7-inch displays.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> one-ups the older model with a Dynamic AMOLED HDR10+ primary display with a 2640 x 1080 resolution, 2,600-nit peak brightness, and 120Hz refresh rate. It also has a 3.4-inch external display and a Super AMOLED cover display with a 2640 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution, a 1,600-nit peak brightness level, and a 60Hz refresh rate. Since the newer display is made of a better Foldable Thin Glass (FTG) material, that reduces the crease&apos;s visibility.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 has an AMOLED HDR10+ primary display with a 2600 x 1080 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. However, the peak brightness isn&apos;t as high, as it can only reach 1,200 nits on the primary display and 919 nits on the external display. The older model&apos;s crease is much more visible than the newer one&apos;s since it&apos;s a UTG display.</p>

<p>There is clearly a winner in the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 4 showdown. It makes sense that you would see improved specs with each generation, such as in the processor and other areas.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a more powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor like the one found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro</a>. Other specifications include 12GB RAM, 50MP (f/1.8), and an improved 4,000mAh battery. There is also a vapor chamber to reduce throttling and give you a better gaming experience.</p><p>With the latest model, you also get 256GB or 512GB of storage, 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5W reverse wireless charging, a 12MP f/2.2 ultrawide camera, a 10MP f/2.2 selfie camera, and a 50MP f/1.8 primary camera.</p><p>The much older Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 has a slower Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 3,700mAh battery, no vapor chamber, 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5W reverse wireless charging, and more storage options of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. Neither the older nor newer Flip models have expandable storage or headphone jacks. It’s best to choose a generous storage option so you always have enough space for future updates.</p>

<p>With differences in specifications like this, it is clear you get so much more with the latest Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. You get a bigger external display that lets you do more without opening your phone, which helps keep the primary display scratch-free longer. If you love taking pictures, the improved primary camera and Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor are good reasons to upgrade.</p><p>But if you give your Flip phone light use and only use it for basic things, then upgrading can wait. Who knows, next year’s Flip phone might have specifications that make it impossible not to upgrade.</p>

<ul><li>Mark Zuckerberg shared a photo back in February showing him working at a desk with various VR headsets and glasses around his desk.</li><li>A closer look at the glasses on his desk revealed an unknown thicker pair that looked like AR glasses.</li><li>Zuckerberg responded to a social media post about the frames, noting that they'll be shown off later this year.</li></ul>
<p>Meta rules the roost in both the smart glasses and VR headset industries, and the company&apos;s CEO says it&apos;s getting ready to announce its latest pair of smart glasses to the public later this year.</p><p>Ironically, we already got a glimpse of the glasses earlier this year in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C27tpcvx77t">February post</a> on Threads when CEO Mark Zuckerberg took part in the "how it started vs how it&apos;s going" social media craze. The photo, shown above, puts Zuckerberg side-by-side with his younger self, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@mkarolian/post/C9tk7--Aey7?xmt=AQGztODCBevtyILYsE9DxASDLq4WKuzUWWemUrSNg1XjHQ">one social media poster</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/meta-new-ar-glasses-3463262/">Android Authority</a>) realized that the current photo hid what looks to be Meta&apos;s upcoming AR glasses as they sport thicker frames and arms than normal pair of glasses.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when asked about them, Zuckerberg replied, "will be ready to share more later this year." While we only know bits and pieces about the upcoming glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">my interview with the head of AR glasses at Meta</a> revealed that Meta is working on a game-changing product that&apos;s set to redefine how we think of smart glasses. That includes a wide field of view and augmented reality technology that will give "customers a new experience they haven&apos;t had before."</p><p>The annual Meta Connect conference <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected">happens on September 25</a> this year where we expect Meta to debut its smart glasses and the new, cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> headset.</p><p>Last year, Meta released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses,</a> which have been met with rave reviews from critics and customers alike. Meta&apos;s upcoming AR glasses will likely build upon the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ups-ai-game-and-brings-calm-amazon-music-and-more-to-ray-ban-smartglasses">robust AI features</a> on its glasses by including a display in at least one of the lenses.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google seems to have considerably rushed its Pixel release schedule this year, first announcing an Aug. 13 launch event. Then, it officially revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">a teaser for the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, in a rare move for the company. This release cycle is anything but the norm for Google, and it has culminated in a YouTube Shorts teaser that might reveal more about the Pixel 9 Pro. </p><p>The video is titled "22 reasons you should say goodbye to your phone and hello to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/pixel9/shorts">#Pixel9</a> Pro with Gemini," and you&apos;d think the video would be as simple as that. However, it isn&apos;t quite that straightforward. It contains an assortment of cryptic Pixel references that don&apos;t really tell us that much about the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship smartphones</a>. In fact, you could argue that Google&apos;s original teasers for the new devices revealed more than this Short. </p>

<ul><li>Wishing your photo had more scenery</li><li>Forgetting the movie your friend recommended </li><li>Forgetting the show your friend recommended </li><li>Phone calls where you can barely hear the other person </li><li>Concert videos that look too far away</li><li>Your toddler is looking everywhere except the camera</li><li>Scrubbing videos for answers </li><li>Gatekeeping </li><li>So many emails. So little time. </li><li>Screening calls yourself</li><li>Half the fam is looking at the camera</li><li>Not capturing the right moment </li><li>Spending hours on hold</li><li>The sky not being right </li><li>The same old memes</li><li>Lost in translation </li><li>Forgetting what restaurant your friend liked</li><li>Awkward photo requests to strangers</li><li>Mom never being in the pic </li><li>Photobombers </li><li>Blurry photo</li><li>Writer's block</li></ul>
<p>The second that you start to think about the items that are on this list, it becomes immediately clear that many of these features are already available on Pixel devices. For example, the reference to "photobombers" probably relates to Magic Editor and Magic Eraser, which you can use on current Pixel devices — and even non-Pixel phones, for Magic Eraser. The same goes for "screening calls yourself," which is obviously a callback to the Call Screen feature on Pixel phones. </p><p>There are also plenty of references to current artificial intelligence features available through Google AI and Gemini. The last of the 22 reasons is "writer&apos;s block," and that&apos;s almost certainly a reference to Help Me Write. "Your toddler looking everywhere except the camera" definitely refers to Best Take, the Pixel 8 series feature that can blend multiple photos together to form the best shot. "Scrubbing videos for answers" could refer to many AI features on YouTube, including AI-generated summaries. </p><p>However, there are some things that sound like new features here. For starters, the "wishing your photo had more scenery" bullet point sounds a lot like what Samsung just introduced with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 series. It added a feature called Sketch to Image, which turns your drawing into an AI-generated object that can be added to an existing photo. Perhaps Google plans to copy this feature for the Pixel 9 Pro launch, and that&apos;s the first reason for referencing it. </p><p>Additionally, there are a few hints that Google may be indeed prepping a feature similar to Microsoft Recall. For those unfamiliar, Recall was a Windows 11 and Copilot+ feature that was supposed to capture screenshots of everything you do on your computer. Then, it would use AI to index all that data and make it easily searchable. It&apos;s like a <em>memory</em> for your PC. According to rumors, Google may be introducing a feature similar to Android 15, and it could be a Pixel exclusive.</p><p>"Forgetting the movie your friend recommended" and "Forgetting the show your friend recommended" could be teasers about a Recall-esque featue. The point about "Forgetting what restaurant your friend liked" could be related to this feature, too. However, these references could be as simple as an enhanced search feature in Google Messages — we really don&apos;t know yet. </p>

<p>That&apos;s precisely the problem with Google&apos;s 22 reasons for upgrading to the Pixel 9 series: they&apos;re just not all that convincing. Many of the features can be had on existing Pixel devices — even ones that are a few years old. The potentially new features are hinted at in such a cryptic way that it&apos;s tricky to decipher what they actually are. Plus, these are mostly AI-based software features, which average consumers have been uninterested to date.</p><p>But hey, Google&apos;s new YouTube Short has people talking about the Pixel 9 series. It really seems like Google is trying to control the narrative around this smartphone launch as much as possible. The early event, paired with multiple teasers and an official announcement, very well may be intended to stave off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-memory-modem-images-leak" target="_blank">leaks and rumors</a>.</p><p>However, it&apos;s way too early to say the Pixel 9 Pro is worth upgrading to. Google&apos;s eight-second teaser might drive up a bit of excitement, but it isn&apos;t moving the needle yet.  </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As Android Central&apos;s resident flip phone guy, I was initially quite excited about the prospect of two flip phones launching so close together. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 was unveiled just weeks after the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 launched, so it was hard not to make comparisons between the two. Unfortunately, that didn&apos;t exactly play out in favor of the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Compared to the Razr Plus 2024, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is very much an iterative update over its predecessor. That doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t upgrades to be found, and some of them are the kind of upgrades we hoped to see on last year&apos;s model. And, of course, there&apos;s plenty of new software to play around with, as Galaxy AI is pretty much running the show.</p><p>So, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> worth buying? I&apos;ve spent roughly two weeks with the phone, so hopefully, this initial review can give you enough insight to decide.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-boast-ai-upgrades-and-thinner-bodies">launched</a> the Galaxy Z Flip 6 on July 10 during the Galaxy Unpacked July 2024 event. The phone goes on sale on July 24 and retails for $1099.</p><p>You can choose either 256GB or 512GB of storage, although the latter option will cost $1219. If you preorder the phone, you can get a free upgrade to the higher storage option, although it&apos;s unclear how long this and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-preorder-deals">Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals</a> are going to last.</p><p>There are several available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors</a> to choose from, including Yellow, Mint, Silver Shadow, and Blue.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="V8AvqfT8JFyXTGDiy8s4s3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-03.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a blue table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V8AvqfT8JFyXTGDiy8s4s3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4092" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as design goes, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 made few changes from the Galaxy Z Flip 5. It now has a completely flat Aluminum Armor frame with a matte finish instead of a glossy one, a change reminiscent of the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also a hair thinner when folded; otherwise, it&apos;s the same size and weight as its predecessor. It&apos;s a bit impressive, given some of the spec bumps the phone has received, which I&apos;ll talk about later. And speaking of fold, the hinge is very stiff and sturdy, just like the rest of the phone.</p><p>One big upgrade we see this year is the inclusion of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">official dust resistance rating</a>, bringing the phone to IP48. This ensures it&apos;s protected against particles larger than 1mm in size, so it&apos;s not foolproof, but it&apos;s a major improvement nonetheless.</p><p>Even with the impressive durability, I recommend adding a case. Fortunately, we have a collection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">Galaxy Z Flip 6 cases</a> for you to check out. I personally like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7C9BLD4">this one from Thinborne</a>.</p>

<p>The internal 6.7-inch OLED display retains the 2640 x 1080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, although the brightness has been jacked up to 2600 nits. The result is a display that is quite bright and vibrant, even with the screen mode set to Natural (my preference). I often find that the built-in screen protector can hinder the view a bit on foldables, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case with the Galaxy Z Flip 6. It&apos;s also very visible outdoors, which is a huge plus.</p><p>Another win is the crease, which Samsung has drastically minimized thanks to "enhanced layers" on the main screen. Now, when I run my finger across the display, the crease is hardly noticeable, although not completely nonexistent.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hardware-specs"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Hardware & specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ES3wmwyHL8PcbtmanAUWsP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-21.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 sideways on a ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ES3wmwyHL8PcbtmanAUWsP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4235" height="2382" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy brings a welcome performance bump (although the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was plenty powerful) along with the 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB. This phone breezes through everything you throw at it. I&apos;ve played a few games like Honkai: Star Rail and Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, and the gameplay is incredibly smooth, even at the highest settings. It probably won&apos;t blow any of the best gaming phones out of the park, but you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed in the performance.</p>

<p>Of course, you won&apos;t find a 3.5mm headphone jack, but you will find a decent set of stereo speakers with plenty of depth and clarity when listening to music.</p><p>For battery life, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a larger 4,000mAh battery, which does well when combined with the more efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. I find that I get between six and eight hours of battery life with a single charge, and after unplugging at 8 a.m., the phone will be on its last leg by 8 p.m. The only downside is that despite the bump in battery capacity, the charging speed remains at 25W, while other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> have surpassed that speed.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Cover screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zPTURLLLkEpCBZYJS7LCUS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-22.jpg" alt="Weather widget on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPTURLLLkEpCBZYJS7LCUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, my experience with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen has been mixed. Samsung continues to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">hinder the cover screen experience</a> in the same ways that it did with the Galaxy Z Flip 5, so I won&apos;t really rehash that too much. The focus is on panels, or "widgets," and less on using full apps, and the experience as intended works, for the most part.</p><p>Widgets like Weather are well-designed and mostly do what&apos;s expected of them, providing glanceable information, so you&apos;re <em>hopefully</em> opening your phone less for certain things. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t really interact with them much aside from scrolling through details or selecting different days to view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Samsung now lets you fit multiple widgets onto a single panel. This is somewhat limited, too, as you&apos;ll have to select from preset dimensions. Some options will take up a full panel, while others will fit into 2x2 or 2x4 spaces, but it depends on the app, and you can&apos;t resize them like you can on the Razr Plus 2024 cover screen.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the cover screen experience isn&apos;t much different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. There are some fun new interactive wallpapers, and you can add AI wallpapers to the cover screen. You&apos;ll have to dig into Labs or the Good Lock app if you want to use full apps, but once set up, the experience is decent. There&apos;s still no multitasking, and you&apos;ll still be prompted to open the phone for many things, so be prepared to open the phone more often than not.</p>

<p>I was happy to learn Samsung upgraded the primary camera to a 50MP sensor. While I can&apos;t say now whether it&apos;s <em>significantly</em> better than its predecessor, I&apos;m quite pleased with the result. Images have plenty of contrast, depth, and vibrancy. The camera can struggle a bit with dynamic range, and the sky will often appear blown out. However, I haven&apos;t run into this very often.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung still struggles with movement, so images can come out a little blurry and lacking in detail if your subject isn&apos;t completely still, and there is sometimes some distortion toward the edges of the image. Fortunately, zooming and low light are also handled well, making for a well-rounded camera experience. However, so far, I&apos;m not a fan of how selfies make my darker skin look, showing that Samsung still has some work in this regard.</p>

<p>The video quality is pretty good, and my only complaint here so far is that recording is limited to 4K 60, although who is really recording in 8K resolution?</p><p>There is a new feature in the video mode that effectively turns the phone into a camcorder when you fold it 90 degrees. The UI adjusts to fit the viewfinder on the top half of the screen and gives you a zoom slighter on the bottom half when you begin recording. It&apos;s a neat way to take advantage of the form factor.</p>

<p>As usual, I would recommend downloading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant app</a>, which adds more useful features to your camera, such as a 2x button for faster zooming, auto HDR, a faster shutter button, and more.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">One UI 6.1.1</a> out of the box, which comes with some new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. I haven&apos;t had a chance to really test some of these out, such as the upgraded interpreter mode that utilizes the cover screen, but my limited time testing that feature in my hands-on left me quite intrigued.</p><p>I&apos;m both impressed and perplexed by some of the image-generation features. Drawing Assist is truly fascinating and will not only add some fairly realistic and amusing images to your photos via Sketch to Image, but it will also turn your doodles into entertaining "works of art" that only a mother could love.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QF7GDsBEH2S7fiDvxVqSd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-10.jpg" alt="Generative AI drawing of R2-D2 on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QF7GDsBEH2S7fiDvxVqSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can&apos;t say as much about Portrait Studio in Photo Assist, where the phone will attempt to generate artistic versions of faces out of a selection of different styles. My colleague Nick Sutrich and I wanted to like this feature in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">hands-on with the Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, but the images it would generate looked nothing like us, instead churning out generic-looking faces with at least the same skin tone.</p><p>The experience on my Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no different, leaving me pretty disappointed. Maybe you&apos;ll get lucky and find one that somewhat resembles you if you squint, but this is probably a feature you can ignore (for now).</p>

<p>The Live Effect feature is cool, turning transforming 2D photos into cinematic videos, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-cinematic-wallpaper-on-android-14">Cinematic Wallpapers</a> on a Pixel phone. It appears to be based on Samsung&apos;s excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-lift-objects-from-a-photo-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Image Clipper</a> feature, separating the subject from the background and then creating a video that can be used as your wallpaper. I do wish the effect was actually based on motion instead of just looping a video when set on your lock or cover screens, but the effect is still pretty cool.</p>
<p>Aside from the new Galaxy AI features, you also get Google AI features like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which I love.</p><p>Samsung is extending its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> software update promise to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, meaning users can expect at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-receive">seven years of updates and OS upgrades</a>. Whether or not a foldable like the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will last that long is another thing.</p>

<p>Foldables are still a growing segment, particularly flip phones, but there are still some good phones that will give the Galaxy Z Flip 6 a run for its money. The most obvious is the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which also just launched and will be available for purchase at the same time as the Z Flip 6. OPPO&apos;s Find N3 Flip is also a phone worth considering, particularly if you live outside North America.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 features very similar specs to the Z Flip 6, with a flagship Snapdragon chip, 12GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery. The Razr is $100 cheaper and has a larger, more functional cover screen, which makes it a tempting buy over the Flip. That said, the Flip has a more powerful chipset and better software support (based on Samsung&apos;s track record). Additionally, some may prefer to have an ultrawide camera over a telephoto sensor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a> has a great display, a sleek design, and a fantastic camera system. The battery capacity is also larger then most other flip phones, but the phone isn&apos;t really available in North America, so there may be some incompatibilities, and ColorOS is definitely an acquired taste.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're interested in a new flip phone.</li><li>You want access to the latest AI features from Samsung and Google.</li><li>You're already ingrained in Samsung's ecosystem.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're tempted by the cheaper Motorola Razr Plus 2024.</li><li>You want a useful cover screen experience.</li><li>You don't want to spend more than $1000 on a phone.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung is clearly playing it safe with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is more evident by Motorola&apos;s Razr Plus 2024 launch a week prior, offering upgraded specs, a larger cover screen with a refined experience, and a cheaper price tag. That&apos;s not to say this is a bad phone because it&apos;s not. I would normally have no problem recommending this phone because it&apos;s quite a fine phone, but with a $100 price bump, I&apos;m not sure I can recommend this over last year&apos;s just-as-fine Galaxy Z Flip 5.</p><p>If you can find some deals and you&apos;re rocking the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a>, then I&apos;d say go ahead and buy the Galaxy Z Flip 6. But even then, I would almost recommend the Razr Plus 2024 instead, which has already had some intriguing deals ahead of its official sale date.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ll continue testing the phone to see if Samsung can change my mind. Be sure to check back for an updated review with my full thoughts on the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>

Pessimistic is probably too nice of a word, because when looking at the rest of the market, it&apos;s abundantly clear that Samsung is no longer the market leader.</p><p>As the rumors and leaks made headlines, whatever excitement I had for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 quickly dissipated. And during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, the larger foldable seemed like an afterthought, taking a back seat to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>I understand that book-style foldable phones aren&apos;t as popular, likely due to their higher prices. Along with the fact that not everyone wants or cares about the benefits of having a mini tablet that fits in your pocket. So while many, including my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Derrek</a>, prefer a flip phone, it&apos;s just not my cup of tea.</p>

<p>Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold 6 at its Unpacked event on July 10, alongside an array of additional Galaxy devices. The phone is currently available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-preorder-deals">pre-order</a> ahead of its launch on July 24, with a starting price of $1,899 for the 256GB base model and maxing out at $2,259 for the 1TB version.</p><p>Additionally, there are a total of five colors to choose from: Pink, Navy, Silver Shadow, Crafted Black, and White. However, the latter two colors are only available if you purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 6 directly from Samsung&apos;s website.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ui5VEKUhKJxuSo4Edt3GBK" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-14.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 5 Cover Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ui5VEKUhKJxuSo4Edt3GBK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 was the first time that I wasn&apos;t actually excited about a new foldable phone. While watching Galaxy Unpacked, I scoffed at the idea that a boxier design would result in me replacing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-oneplus-should-delay-open-2">OnePlus Open</a> as part of my "daily carry." But, as I sit here having spent a little more than a week with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, my opinion is shifting. Slightly.</p><p>One thing is for certain, so far at least, as my opinion hasn&apos;t changed regarding Samsung needing to do something drastic. I mean like a complete overhaul of the design, whether it&apos;s to a tri-fold, adopting the shorter and wider screens of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-week-with-the-google-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold</a>, or something. Save for a few things here and there, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Fold 5 are identical, which was the same as the Fold 4, etc.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-design-and-cover-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Design and Cover Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-11.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I&apos;m so pessimistic, what could Samsung possibly have done to even change my mind in the slightest? Well, it actually starts with the boxier design. This move brings it more in line with what we saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, complete with the bottom left corner digging into the palm of my hand.</p><p>On paper, this design tweak brought with it a 1.05mm increase in the dimensions when closed, making for an ever-so-slightly larger cover screen. It really didn&apos;t seem like much, but I&apos;ve noticed that my hands feel less cramped when typing out messages or jotting down some notes. Really, it&apos;s not much of a difference, but it&apos;s enough to be noticeable while still falling far short of the OnePlus Open or Pixel Fold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-20.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open Cover Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Arguably even more important is that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is substantially lighter than its predecessor. In terms of numbers, Samsung managed to slim it down to 239 grams, a staggering drop from the 253 grams of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a>. It&apos;s definitely noticeable, and welcome, especially when using the Fold 6 with one hand while the phone is closed.</p><p>I&apos;ve made it this far without even talking about the inner display or AI, which is more than what some companies can say. That being said, let&apos;s dive into that now, starting with the inner screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hinge"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Hinge</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wpueLMK2uaS5x8s2pxJNBo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-10.jpg" alt="Close-up on Samsung logo on Galaxy Z Fold 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wpueLMK2uaS5x8s2pxJNBo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else Samsung changed with the design is that it&apos;s now much easier to actually unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6. There&apos;s a little bit more of a gap between the two sides of the frame. This might sound like a bad thing, but the outer border of the inner screen still closes tightly so that dust and debris don&apos;t make it through.</p><p>I discovered this, as one does when using the Fold 6 as a fidget toy. I don&apos;t even know how I managed to do it, but I was able to slightly open the phone with just one hand. The only other book-style foldable I&apos;ve been able to do that with is the OnePlus Open.</p><p>The reason why I&apos;m pointing this out is because it&apos;s just much easier to unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6 compared to the Fold 5. The hinge feels about as perfect as one can get, even smoother than the Pixel Fold and the Open. Not to mention that I don&apos;t feel much resistance (in a good way), and the screen/hinge doesn&apos;t make discomforting noises. I&apos;m hoping the hinge will stay this way, but it&apos;s obviously too early to say with any certainty.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-inner-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Inner screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PrzagfR3vjSSkvhpUAwuS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-7.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 inner screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PrzagfR3vjSSkvhpUAwuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Fold 6 open, I&apos;m now staring at a beautiful AMOLED display with a subtle crease down the middle. Seriously, Samsung does make some of the best screens. It&apos;s just a shame and quite frustrating that the company won&apos;t offer any reasons or remedies to those who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">suffer from PWM</a>. One would think that if a company is trying to reach as many people as possible, it would do something or at least give a disclaimer that the screens might affect you negatively.</p><p>Nevertheless, let&apos;s talk about that crease. If I was just going into this thing blind, without having a Fold 5 to compare it to, I&apos;d probably say that the crease is the same with the Fold 6. That&apos;s not the case, as I do notice a slight difference between the two. It&apos;s not much, but there is a difference. However, I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s because the Fold 5 is a year old, while the Fold 6 is less than a month old, or if Samsung actually did manage to improve the crease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even still, there is one thing that didn&apos;t take me long to notice, as all I had to do was use the inner screen while outside. This thing gets BRIGHT. No, it&apos;s not going to blind you or anything, but it&apos;s definitely brighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5. That&apos;s because Samsung&apos;s display now reaches a peak brightness of 2,600 nits.</p><p>This is the same peak brightness level as Samsung introduced with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, surpassing the 1,750 nits found in the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The one thing that the Fold 6s main display doesn&apos;t adopt from the S24 Ultra is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">anti-reflective coating</a>. It&apos;s not all that surprising since we&apos;re still working with ultra-thin glass and plastic, but I figured it was worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Something else I&apos;m planning on diving deeper into, but thought was worth mentioning are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. The "Sketch to Image" feature, to be more precise. Before going further, I invite you to enjoy a hearty laugh at my drawings. There&apos;s a reason why I take pictures and type on a keyboard for a living.</p><p>Okay, with that out of the way, I think this is arguably one of the coolest things that&apos;s possible with Galaxy AI. You can either draw something out in the Samsung Notes app or use AI to generate images. I know my "artistry" is on par with a 3rd grader, but c&apos;mon, I expected results better than what I got.</p>

<p>However, where this feature managed to impress was when making additions to pictures I&apos;ve taken. For the first one, I tried to draw a sailboat with shark fins surrounding it. So while it didn&apos;t exactly get what I was going for, the end result was much better than expected, even adding reflections in the water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="t4LVdkp3MCoQfy7BV3JNdU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-23.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Sketch to Image"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t4LVdkp3MCoQfy7BV3JNdU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next up, was drawing a crown on my son&apos;s head of a picture I snapped while out at a local crab house. This one turned out just about perfect, and you can&apos;t even tell that it&apos;s AI-generated, except for the watermark in the bottom left corner. There&apos;s no way to avoid this, even when using Samsung&apos;s built-in wallpaper generator.</p><p>Last but not least, a bear made a surprise appearance while I was walking down to a local beach. Okay, but seriously, this is the fun stuff when it comes to the onslaught of AI generators and buzzwords. The only problem is that, at least with Sketch to Image, it&apos;s really just a parlor trick, albeit an impressive one.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when Samsung and its Galaxy Z Fold was the only game in town. In terms of book-style foldable phones, Samsung&apos;s stiffest competition comes from OnePlus and Google. The former burst onto the scene in late 2023 with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, which is essentially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-and-n3-flip-global-launch">Oppo Find N3</a> with OnePlus branding. </p><p>Meanwhile, Google has the Pixel Fold, which comes with its own list of benefits and pitfalls. However, that shouldn&apos;t be the case for too much longer as Google started teasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. This is expected to arrive on August 13, offering a redesigned camera module, and will hopefully be powered by the same Tensor chip as the rest of the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>That&apos;s pretty much all we have if looking at Samsung&apos;s competition domestically. The story dramatically shifts when considering global markets as Honor, Vivo, and others have caught up and surpassed Samsung&apos;s offerings. Notably, Xiaomi recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Fold 4</a>, with an initial launch in China ahead of a global launch at a later date. </p>

<p>There are a couple of things I&apos;m going to save for the full review, such as the camera along with diving deeper into performance and battery life. With performance, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy performs just as well as you&apos;d suspect. The Fold 6 is fast and snappy, as I have yet to run into any game-breaking slow-downs, save for when I&apos;m trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulate Switch games</a>. But again, more on that in the full review.</p><p>Although I talked about a lot here, there&apos;s still so much more that I want to cover, such as Samsung DeX, the cameras, and gaming. Even still, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has managed to surprise and impress, despite me having basically written it off before Samsung announced it. I don&apos;t know what else I&apos;ll find in my testing, but be sure to reach out if there&apos;s something specific you would like to see covered.</p>

It’s hot pink, and besides the fact that Paris Hilton was sporting the same device, you’re gushing to your friends about the cool new ringtones and selfies you’re about to take. Your phone rings, and when you’re done talking to your mom, you flip the phone shut with a satisfying snap. </p>

<p>Imagine that same concept, except it’s now 2024, and the only thing I can think about is Motorola’s incredibly strategic marketing approach for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>. It has convinced me that the company knows <em>exactly </em>how to grab the heartstrings of nostalgic millennials like me while also creating a vintage feel and interest for an up-and-coming form factor for those in their early 20s. </p><p>I would even argue that because of this strong marketing and the actual changes the company has made to the phone, it could potentially be the best flip phone of the year and one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone"><u>best-selling foldable devices</u></a>. </p><p>More recently, I’ve closely been watching multiple ads pop up for the phone on my TikTok feed, with similar ads cross-promoted on Instagram Reels.</p><p>What caught my attention was how nostalgic and down-to-earth so many of these ads were. They still had high production value, but most ads showcased times we spent hanging out with friends. One ad (below) showed someone doing a Get Ready With Me video, talking about going to a Y2K-themed party and taking their Razr Plus phone with them.</p>

<p>While many of these ads showcased millennials talking about the phone, many also targeted Gen Z.</p><p>It’s not every day that you come across a phone brand that was once incredibly popular, fell short of proper direction and strategy, and now is one that threatens some top-performing companies. </p>
<h2 id="a-familiar-face-form-factor-and-x201c-saving-vintage-x201d-xa0-2">A familiar face, form factor, and “saving vintage” </h2>
<p>Right off the bat, let’s talk about Paris Hilton. Whether you are a fan or not, she’s an icon, and Motorola was brilliant in using her as the face of the brand.</p><p>The company decided to make 2024 feel like 2006 again when it released a hot pink version of the phone. More importantly, having Hilton be the person who shows off the smartphone version of the original Razr—now “<em>that’s hot.”</em> </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL" name="Paris-Hilton-before-after-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024.jpg" alt="A young Paris Hilton with the original Hot Pink Razr V3 and again with the new Hot Pink Razr Plus 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram / Paris Hilton)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s worldwide device tracker, agrees that Hilton “helped popularize the Razr back in the late 2000s, and having her reprise that role is a nice throwback.”</p><p>Of course, Motorola isn’t the only company to use a celebrity as the face of its brand. Samsung has done so, too, by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/medialibrary/global/photo/54939">using Sydney Sweeney</a> during the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a>. However, in the case of Sweeny, she captures a very specific younger audience, and perhaps it doesn’t go beyond that. </p><p>Meanwhile, Anshel Sag, a senior analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that using Hilton “allows Motorola to reach a fairly broad audience that looks to a popular pop-culture figure that is multi-generational.”</p>

<p>We know foldable phones are not a new concept and were introduced many years ago, but the resurgence of clamshell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> is an indication of companies taking something older and refreshing it. Where Motorola has gone beyond Samsung is readjusting its marketing to also fit a younger demographic who might feel the foldable form factor to be “vintage,” and cool.</p><p>Like with any product, we’re noticing younger generations interested in products that were once popular, and as Vogue nicely put it, “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/paris-hilton-on-vintage-bad-haircut-pink-motorola-flip-phone" target="_blank">Paris is saving vintage</a>” 20 years later.</p><p>“I have so many memories of my Razr. Taking selfies with my friends, using it like a fashion accessory—I would clip it on my low-rise jeans and show it off, it’d always have crystals on it. I also loved prank calling people on it or using it like a prop and walking through crowds pretending to be talking on it,” Hilton tells Vogue. </p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 not only looks vintage AND nostalgic at the same time, it plays into both those emotions. But beyond that, its camera has a photobooth feature and also sports a 2x telephoto camera for portrait images instead of an ultrawide sensor, which many would find strange, especially for a flip phone. </p>

<p>Ubrani thinks that this fits well with Gen Z and their needs “as they tend to prioritize selfies over landscapes,” which ironically was also something I loved to prioritize in my early 20s. </p><p>Apart from that, the new phone has a larger more functional cover screen, bigger main display with a higher refresh rate, and faster charging speeds than the Flip. The company also uses vegan leather instead of glass on the back to help it stand out even more against phones with traditional glass backs.</p><p>The phone is unique enough that even iPhone users have been taking an interest in it. As one user named CarelessPangolin2890 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr/comments/1dznx6j/im_an_iphone_user_deep_in_their_ecosystem_but_the/"><u>writes in a Reddit post</u></a>, “I’m an iPhone user deep in the ecosystem, but the Razr+ 2024 is really calling me!” </p><p>Another user, Unwitched, writes “I’m on the same boat! My boyfriend and I are both iPhone users, since the 1st generation for me and the 4th or 5th for him, and we decided we wanted to switch to this phone when we saw a commercial for it a few months ago. </p><p>“[To be honest] we’re just taking the plunge and going for it. I haven’t been excited for the latest iPhone for several years now and I’ve grown bored.”</p>

<p>The fact is that Motorola took a while to develop its new and improved foldable strategy, particularly after taking some time off from the U.S. to essentially find itself.</p><p>Motorola has always been a pioneer in creating fun and colorful phones in a time when blocks and colorlessness were the norm. It was on stage with the likes of Nokia, LG, Samsung, and Blackberry, but unlike its peers, Motorola wanted to be different and really stand out and did so by releasing the thinnest flip phone at the time.</p><p>But it’s experienced many ups and downs, going from being a popular brand to one that struggled to compete seriously in the smartphone market with seemingly no clear strategy, particularly regarding foldable phones.</p>

<p>Android Central’s Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-needs-put-work-maintain-its-spot" target="_blank">wrote a scathing article in 2021</a> about how the company had not met expectations in a very competitive landscape. </p><p>He wrote, “While I respect Motorola’s hustle to make a phone for everyone, I can’t help being disappointed every time the company announces a new smartphone for the U.S. market.,” adding that at the time, Motorola just seemed like it was “doing the bare minimum when it comes to the mobile industry.”</p><p>The company showed off its 2021 lineup, and “absolutely none of the devices look remotely interesting.” </p><p>But perhaps it was losing LG in the smartphone market and putting the spotlight on Motorola that forced the company to take a hard look in the mirror and step it up.</p>

<p>Ubrani says this “helped the brand succeed with a younger audience who doesn’t want the same brand as their parents or other older folks. Motorola went from a pioneer mobile phone maker to a dominant one to an underdog to potentially a leader of the counterculture as Gen Z picks up the brand.” </p><p>Sag agrees, adding that “the Razr series is the tip of that spear, and they seem to be doing the best there in terms of marketing.”</p><p>And all of this literally happened in the span of a couple of decades.</p>

<p>This brings us back to my main point about how the Razr Plus 2024, very clearly, could be the best flip phone of the year. </p><p>In his review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review"><u>Lee writes that the phone</u></a> has exceeded all of his expectations, that the company “seemed to address just about everything that [he] didn’t like about last year’s Razr Plus while adding some upgrades [he] didn’t expect.”</p><p>The result is a phone that we believe “sets a new standard for flip phones.”</p><p>“Of course, no one is perfect, and the Razr Plus 2024 has its quirks. But Samsung should really be taking notes for the Galaxy Z Flip lineup because Motorola is really doing something special with its 2024 Razr lineup,” Lee writes.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-x201c-should-certainly-feel-threatened-x201d-xa0-2">Samsung “should certainly feel threatened” </h2>
<p>How awkward was it then that the day after, Lee writes in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on"><u>Samsung Z Flip 6 hands-on</u></a> that the phone is a “losing battle,” further pointing out that “this feels familiar, but not in a good way.”</p><p>“The Galaxy Z Flip 6 reminds me a lot of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024…but somehow, it might be a worse version of what Motorola has managed to pull off surprisingly well.” </p><p>It also didn’t help Samsung’s case when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-lower-pre-order-numbers">early reported numbers</a> indicated the company achieved 910,000 foldable units pre-ordered in South Korea, much smaller than its record-shattering number in 2023. It also reported that pre-orders dropped by 10%. Meanwhile, Motorola has seen its foldable market share grow as Samsung&apos;s shrinks amid stiff competition.</p>

<p>Ubrani believes now is a time when Samsung “should certainly feel threatened.” </p><p>This is partly because the company’s dominance amongst foldables has been eroded by Chinese vendors in Asia/Europe and companies like Motorola in the U.S. </p><p>Though Ubrani does add that “while we don’t have data on this, there’s the possibility that Samsung’s scale has allowed it to maintain higher profits compared to Motorola, and if that’s the case, then the situation may not be as dire for Samsung as we think.”</p><p>Regardless of all of this, what brings my focus back to Motorola every year is that it listens to its audience. It understands what they want and is trying to have a cohesive brand that is creative in a world where there’s a lot of foldable competition. </p><p>I don’t think I will be a fan of foldable phones until companies are able to figure out a better material for the screen that minimizes the crease to the point where it’s non-existent. But I can strongly say that the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is a phone I’m closely monitoring and thinking about; maybe it might be the phone that will make me love foldables.</p>
