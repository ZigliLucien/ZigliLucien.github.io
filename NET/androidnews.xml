                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>My go-to power bank these days is UGREEN's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode Power Bank</a>. It has a 25000mAh battery, charges three devices at once, and goes up to 200W. While it is ideal for travel, it is quite heavy, and not exactly pocketable. Sometimes, I just need a smaller power bank that I can take anywhere, so in recent weeks, I turned to Stuffcool's Roam power bank. <br><br>Stuffcool is a leading manufacturer of charging accessories in India, and I used the brand's products for half a decade now, including recent launches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-giga-is-the-indian-brands-best-65w-power-bank-yet">Giga</a>. With the Roam, the brand is switching to a new design that looks modern, and the white color scheme looks really good. And coming in at just 182g, you can easily carry it in your pocket or a bag, and pocketability is one of the biggest selling points of the power bank.</p>

<p>The Roam has a 10000mAh power bank, and it is quite affordable, retailing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Roam-10000mAh-Powerbank-Universal/dp/B0DFYZTJMC">just ₹1,399 on Amazon India</a>. Stuffcool just came out with a bigger model dubbed the Roam+ that has a 20000mAh battery, and that is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Roam-20000mAh-Powerbank-Charging/dp/B0DFYZWRFQ">even better deal at ₹1,799</a>. Regardless of whichever model you choose, you get a similar design and 20W charging.</p>

<p>The power bank is made out of plastic, and you get an acrylic fascia with Stuffcool branding and travel-related icons. What I like about the design is that there's an LED bar at the bottom that shows the remaining battery level, and it is a nifty inclusion. Although the Roam is significantly smaller than most power banks I used, you still get a USB-A port in addition to USB-C connectivity, and that's good to see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SfJPW85Mb6goFr9dQzx3Z4" name="Stuffcool Roam" alt="Stuffcool Roam power bank with USB-C and USB-A connectivity highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SfJPW85Mb6goFr9dQzx3Z4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The internal 10000mAh battery charges at 18W over the USB PD protocol, and the power bank is able to deliver 20W of power over the USB-C port for charging phones and accessories, and 22.5W over USB-A. It takes over two hours to charge the internal battery, so your best bet is to do so overnight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CKmmkhBWRpBraEMdCvTtT4" name="Stuffcool Roam" alt="Stuffcool Roam back view showcasing charging details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKmmkhBWRpBraEMdCvTtT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While 20W charging is limiting at times, it isn't a problem if you're using an iPhone or Samsung device. If anything, the power bank managed to do a decent enough job with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. Now, although it has a 10000mAh battery, you can't use it to charge two phones with 5000mAh batteries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2u9DnVun5kqDhGvrzFCna4" name="Stuffcool Roam" alt="Stuffcool Roam power bank with LED battery indicator highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u9DnVun5kqDhGvrzFCna4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inherent nature of charging means energy is wasted, and in my testing, I was able to charge the X200 Pro's 6000mAh battery just via the power bank, so you get decent charging efficiency. In daily use, you should get about 6000mAh worth of usable charging power, and that is in line with other 10000mAh power banks I tested recently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uP2rXaxHuMQnGes5scBUd4" name="Stuffcool Roam" alt="Stuffcool Roam next to UGREEN's magnetic power bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uP2rXaxHuMQnGes5scBUd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Power banks come in all sizes and designs these days, and the Roam does a good job delivering plenty of power in a small package. I'd suggest getting the Roam+ if you need a bigger battery, but if you just want something to charge your phone over the course of a day, the convenience of the standard Roam is unmatched, and it costs less than equivalent products from other brands.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nubia clearly knows how to make phones that stand out; its Redmagic series of gaming phones have flamboyant designs, and the Z series has unique cameras. I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Z60 Ultra</a> last year, and while the software was buggy at times and the camera quality wasn't the best, the hardware was among the best of any phone I tested. <br><br>Not much has changed with the Z70 Ultra, and that's a good thing. The phone shares the same design language, and it's just as massive as last year. Another plus point is the AMOLED panel; Nubia continues to deliver a screen that doesn't have any noticeable camera cutout, and that's a big deal. <br><br>The internal hardware has been refreshed to include Qualcomm's latest silicon, and you get an even bigger 6150mAh battery this time around. The 50MP camera at the back has a 35mm lens, and you get extras that aren't available on any other device. Nubia didn't mess with the software either, and you get a clean interface that doesn't have much bloatware. <br><br>Like previous years, Nubia managed to undercut its immediate rivals, and the result is a device that gives you the latest hardware without the inflated price tag.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GC8EAyYCH6EjFEgTaUD98g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GC8EAyYCH6EjFEgTaUD98g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nubia unveiled the Z70 Ultra on November 21, 2024, and the phone is now available globally. The base 12GB/256GB model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://intl.nubia.com/products/nubia-z70-ultra?variant=44253397942470">available for $729 at Nubia's website</a>, and if you prefer Amazon, you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/nubia-Z70-Ultra-Android-Cellphone/dp/B0DM5XSD6X">pay an additional $20</a> to get the same variant. The 16GB/512GB edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://intl.nubia.com/products/nubia-z70-ultra?variant=44253397975238">costs $829</a>, and there's also a 24GB/1TB model that will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://intl.nubia.com/products/nubia-z70-ultra?variant=44253398008006">set you back by $949</a>. <br><br>If you are interested in the phone, I'd recommend getting the Starry Night color option. It looks particularly striking, and makes the device that much more distinctive. It is limited to the 16GB/512GB variant, but the unique styling alone makes it a great choice.</p>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-design"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gUU79VzmuNqQzV4vn4hu9g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUU79VzmuNqQzV4vn4hu9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nubia didn't change the design to any noticeable degree, and other than a cleaner camera island at the back, the Z70 Ultra is virtually indistinguishable to its predecessor. It's still a giant slab of a phone, and while it is 18g thinner than the Z60 Ultra, it still weighs 228g, and it's the heaviest phone I used by some margin in recent months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hnq646pTkMXB96vp7TvJCg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hnq646pTkMXB96vp7TvJCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the Z70 Ultra is heavier than foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a>, and that's without adding a case into the mix. While the Starry Night model is obviously the most interesting of the lot, I got the regular black model, and it doesn't have anywhere close to the same design flair. The back has a satin finish that feels good to hold, and it doesn't attract smudges, so that's a win.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xmFaQZjhXhTQAGGssUPu9g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xmFaQZjhXhTQAGGssUPu9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You still get a sizeable camera island that covers the entire top third at the back, but Nubia did a good job tidying up the arrangement of the modules. The main camera is the only one that gets a red-accented ring this time, with the other modules and LED flash sitting underneath. While it looks cleaner, the main lens protrudes quite a bit from the chassis, and it makes the phone wobble when using it on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BKPJLVAeWv8ZXsHFRM4b3g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BKPJLVAeWv8ZXsHFRM4b3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone these days, the Z70 Ultra has flat sides, but there are ever-so-slight bevels that make holding it comfortable. What I like is that the sides have the same texture as the back, and that also makes a difference in usability. Weight distribution is balanced as well, and the phone doesn't feel unwieldy in spite of its size and heft.</p>

<p>The power button gets the usual red accent, and it sits below the volume rocker. Interestingly, Nubia added a shutter button on the right side that lets you launch the camera and take photos. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, it is a physical button, but it doesn't quite have the same tactility as the power and volume buttons.</p>

<p>That isn't all either; Nubia also added a slider button that sits to the left, and you can use this to launch the camera as well. The slider is customizable, so you can use it to toggle the flashlight, launch the gaming utility, switch to silent mode, or start dictating notes. I would have liked granular control, but the ability to toggle silent mode with a physical button is a decent enough start.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eC9eWmdtEvwGfiMFwCHU2g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eC9eWmdtEvwGfiMFwCHU2g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no issues with the optical fingerprint module; it's located high up that accessing it isn't a problem, and it is fast to authenticate. The phone also gets IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, so you can submerge it in 1.5 meters of fresh water and clean it with a pressure washer if so inclined. <br><br>I get the feeling that Nubia went overboard with physical buttons this time, but outside of that, the Z70 Ultra doesn't have any shortcomings as such.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-display"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tGfeuXYjaWTPYADdNCG9Bg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGfeuXYjaWTPYADdNCG9Bg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the defining characteristic of the Z70 Ultra is that you get a massive 6.85-inch AMOLED panel without any visible cutouts. The phone uses an under-display camera module, and it isn't noticeable unless you launch the selfie camera to take photos or make video calls. Not having a cutout mar the screen is amazing, and it definitely makes using the Z70 Ultra that much more immersive when streaming videos and gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hL4w4ccwGZ2JQ4frdEcbAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hL4w4ccwGZ2JQ4frdEcbAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel itself has vibrant colors and a decent amount of customizability, and while it doesn't get as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> or Find X8 Pro, I didn't have any issues under harsh sunlight. It goes up to 144Hz refresh, but that's exclusive to gaming, and it defaults to 120Hz in daily use — like all other phones in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="woEHkJXAoDLpwQVGFQMVAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woEHkJXAoDLpwQVGFQMVAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a dedicated reading mode that switches the panel to monochrome, and I used this feature extensively. At the other end of the scale, there's HDR10 available, and I didn't have any problems streaming HDR content in YouTube. Stereo sound is detailed, and it gets loud enough that you don't need to use earbuds for casual gaming.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PZezBbHuF3yzmUHTrGLaAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZezBbHuF3yzmUHTrGLaAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nubia knows how to deliver a strong hardware package, and while it isn't billed as a gaming phone, it holds up incredibly well in this regard. Of course, the Snapdragon 8 Elite contributes to this in a big way, but Nubia did a good job tuning the device to take full advantage of the platform. The base model has 12GB/256GB, but I'm using the 16GB/512GB edition, and I think this is the variant to get.</p>

<p>There's no lag anywhere, and the interface is fluid — even more so than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>. It is similar to what ASUS does on its phones, and it's a delight to use. It does a much better job while gaming as well, easily able to cross 60fps in visually-intensive games. This is still a point of contention on most phones as manufacturers tend to be on the conservative side in this regard, so it's good to see Nubia not limit gaming in any way. <br><br>It tends to run warm as well, but the upside is that it isn't throttled anywhere as aggressively as other phones I used this year. In 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test, the device went up to a ridiculously-high 59 degrees Celsius — the hottest any device has gotten in my testing. Thankfully, this isn't a problem in daily use, and it doesn't get so hot as to be uncomfortable to use. <br><br>The vibration motor isn't quite on the same level as what you get on other high-end phones, but outside of that quibble, I don't have anything to point out on the hardware side of things. The Z70 Ultra uses the entire suite of Qualcomm codecs — just like ASUS — so you get all the high-res AptX codecs you need.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="havQ94HswZhLZM8HzrSaAg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/havQ94HswZhLZM8HzrSaAg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to battery life, the Z70 Ultra easily manages to last a day and a half between charges, and that's down to the massive 6150mAh silicon-carbide battery. While not the best phone I used in this regard — Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> still holds that title — there's no battery anxiety whatsoever, and even with heavy use, the phone managed to last over a day with relative ease. <br><br>When you do need to charge the device, the bundled 80W charger takes under 50 minutes to top up the device, getting to the 50% mark in just 15 minutes. Nubia includes the charger in the box, and that's something I need to mention these days, because even Chinese brands are now starting to emulate Samsung and just have a cable bundled with the phone. <br><br>Connectivity wasn't an issue either, and I didn't see any problems in regular use or while making calls. On the whole, this is one of the best hardware packages you can get today, and Nubia nailed the basics.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-cameras"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S7u32rL4VyLmy7zVxTm38g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S7u32rL4VyLmy7zVxTm38g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Z70 Ultra comes with a 50MP Sony IMX906 main lens, and it goes from f/1.6 to f/4.0, providing decent flexibility in this regard. It's joined by a 64MP OmniVision OV64B telephoto with 2.7x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. There's a 16MP camera at the front, and while it doesn't have autofocus, it is invisible in daily use, and that's just plain cool. <br><br>The interface itself hasn't changed much, and you get the ability to easily switch between the lenses and shooting modes. There's 4K60 video with all the cameras at the back, but video quality just doesn't hold up to what Vivo and other Chinese brands are doing.</p>

<p>Shots taken in daylight have good colors and dynamic range, but there are times when the resultant photos had cooler colors than usual. The wide-angle lens also has these issues, and it tends to wash out colors at times — you don't get the same tonal balance as the main lens. The phone takes a smidgen longer to focus on a subject, but thankfully there's no shutter delay when you take an image. <br><br>Both cameras are decent at night, but again, they're nowhere at the same level as the Vivo X200 or Find X8. You get usable photos with good details, but they're not the best cameras — not by a long shot. The 64MP telephoto holds its own, thankfully, delivering detailed shots at 2.7x. What I like about the lens is that it doubles as a portrait shooter, and it does a good job in this area. <br><br>While it doesn't go toe-to-toe with the best Vivo and OPPO phones, the Z70 Ultra produces decent photos in any situation.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-software"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Software</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5hrjouSVBTo4xzUuawTABg" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5hrjouSVBTo4xzUuawTABg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other manufacturer these days, Nubia is leaning heavily into AI with its software, and the result is a rebadged name: Nebula AIOS. That said, the interface is identical to last year's MyOS, and I don't really see any difference in the visual design or feature-set. <br><br>Dubiously, you don't get much in the way of AI-assisted features on the Z 70 Ultra; other than a real-time call translation service and smart signal boosting, there isn't anything that stands out. I don't mind this as most AI features are of questionable value anyway, but Nubia went to the effort of rebranding its software, so the least it should have done is add some features that leverage on-device machine learning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EUfznYnd5vXe5J3yv9SJ8g" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EUfznYnd5vXe5J3yv9SJ8g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that though, I have no issues with the interface. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based UI is clean and doesn't have any overt styling, and Nubia deserves credit for not going overboard in this area (looking at you, Xiaomi). The fluidity is one of the best around, and it comes close to what ASUS manages on its own devices. While there's no such thing as a vanilla Android interface any longer — even Pixels have distinct styling — the Z70 Ultra manages to stand out for its clean UI. <br><br>However, Nubia is still aggressive with memory management, so background services routinely close, and I had issues with push notifications once again — they just wouldn't show up reliably. Overall though, it feels much better optimized than last year, and other than the issue with memory management, Nebula AIOS is great to use. <br><br>Nubia usually lags behind its Chinese rivals when it comes to updates, and that's no different this time. The Z70 Ultra is guaranteed to receive three Android OS updates alongside three years of security updates, and that's not on par with what you get with other brands. Considering that the Z60 Ultra is still on Android 14 with no mention of when the stable Android 15 build will roll out to the device, the Z70 Ultra isn't likely to switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> in a timely manner once the software version becomes available later this year.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h3>

<p>If you need a high-end phone that nails the basics, the OnePlus 13 is the ideal starting point. The device also has the same Qualcomm silicon, and it holds up well while gaming. You get much better cameras, and the design isn't anywhere as unwieldy — particularly with the unique leather-backed model. <br><br>Vivo's regular X200 is also a strong alternative. While it doesn't quite have the best overall cameras, it's a definite step up over what you get on the Z70 Ultra, and you're not limited by the hardware — it has the same internals as the X200 Pro. Availability is an issue as Vivo doesn't sell the device in the west, and Funtouch OS isn't quite as good at extended gaming.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nubia-z70-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nubia Z70 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a gaming phone that undercuts its rivals</li><li>You want an AMOLED panel that doesn't have any cutout</li><li>You need a clean UI without much bloatware</li><li>You want all the extras: IP68/IP69, AptX suite, and USB-C 3.2</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need feature-rich software and timely updates</li><li>You want the best cameras</li></ul>
<p>Ultimately, Nubia didn't change the narrative too much with the Z70 Ultra; the phone retains a familiar design and has a clear focus on delivering one of the best hardware packages. The all-screen panel is a huge advantage, and it makes using the phone that much more immersive and enjoyable. <br><br>Other than the fact that it doesn't last as long as the X200 Pro, I can't find anything to fault with the hardware; the Z70 Ultra is incredible at gaming and everyday tasks, and you get the latest Qualcomm silicon and meaningful gaming-focused features. While the software isn't quite as polished, I like that it has better optimization this time around, and the minimal styling makes it a decent alternative to bloated skins that are a mainstay with other Chinese brands. <br><br>The cameras are a sticking point; although the Z70 Ultra does a decent enough job in this area, the camera quality just doesn't measure up to the likes of the OnePlus 13, Vivo X200, and the Find X8, and the inconsistent nature of the images suggests Nubia still has a long way to go in this area. <br><br>If you need the best hardware and don't mind average cameras, the Z70 Ultra is a great choice — Nubia didn't leave anything out, and it is one of the fastest phones I used. But if you need a great overall package, you'll need to consider one of the Chinese alternatives.</p>

                    <p><p>The Z70 Ultra doesn't differ too much from its predecessor, but the software is better this time around, and it makes using the device that much more enjoyable. The unique design with the invisible selfie camera combined with top-tier hardware makes it a straightforward choice if you need a powerful phone in 2025. </p></p>

<p>Not to exaggerate, but I have seen bars of soap that are more physically attractive than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>. If you are as unaroused by the mundane design of the S25 series as I am, there's a little hack to switch things up. Dbrand's slick skins for the S25 lineup can give your Galaxy S25 a much-needed facelift almost instantly.</p><p>I always advocate for protective phone cases, but this is the one time I'll break my own rule. Not because you shouldn't use a phone case — you definitely should, especially if your fingers are as slippery as mine. Purely aesthetically speaking, however, a phone's skin looks far more appealing than a case.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LUUSXE6pJeM2nCySXZaz83" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-options-1" alt="Various cases for the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LUUSXE6pJeM2nCySXZaz83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the curved edges of the S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-one-week-later">S25 Plus</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">S25 Ultra</a> are welcome changes that make it much more comfortable to hold the phones. The S25 devices aren't ugly, either. However, the trio looks nearly identical to last year's S24 lineup, and it's starting to get very stale.</p><p>Dbrand launched its Galaxy S25 skins even before the boring phone series itself. I have used the brand's skins before, as have many of my colleagues here at Android Central. We've all always loved the ease with which a Dbrand skin can be applied, their cost-effectiveness, and their high quality.</p><p>The instructions are simple enough to follow and very straightforward. All you need is a good head on your shoulders, a hairdryer to get the perfect application, and about 15 to 20 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>There are various sorts of Dbrand skins available for the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. You can choose from intriguing patterns, solid monochromes, and leather finishes. Dbrand gives you the leeway to jazz it up to your heart's content.</p><p>You could always choose plain black, but that would defeat the purpose of giving your device a makeover. Instead, I say opt for louder colors like the yellow Area 51 (Hazard) pattern or the glow-in-the-dark Glow Circuit skin.</p>

<p>Available in black, brown, and tan, the leather skin is especially fantastic. It has that grainy texture only genuine hide can produce and adds a ton of grip. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">his review</a>, Nick Sutrich described it as a "time-honored classic" that only gets better looking over time.</p><p>Unfortunately, beauty comes at a cost. The leather skins cost $34.95 as opposed to the $16.95 starting price of other basic skin designs. That's admittedly a lot for glorified "premium" stickers that don't do much in terms of drop protection for your Galaxy S25. You're paying purely for the looks, added grip, and maybe some basic scratch protection on select covered body parts of your phone. However, it could be well worth it to give your phone a classy look.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> is the most popular music streaming service on the planet, and it continued growing in 2024, per its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-02-04/spotify-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-earnings/" target="_blank">fourth-quarter financial results</a>. In a year that saw Spotify double-down on podcasts, video, and AI, all while not delivering on its lossless audio promise from 2024, the platform still grew its subscriber base by 11% year-over-year.</p><p>The company reported having 263 paid subscribers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">Spotify Premium</a> in the fourth quarter, which is an increase from 252 million in the third quarter. It's also above Spotify's internal expectations, which it attributed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-wrapped-2024-arrives">Spotify Wrapped</a> and other holiday marketing campaigns. Additionally, it says it edged out music streaming competitors in emerging markets, like Latin America and global markets.</p><p>Spotify's total monthly active users saw an uptick last year, too, reaching 675 million in 2024. That represents a 12% increase year-over-year, and is also 35 million more monthly active users than Spotify had as recently as Q3 2024. Again, the brand says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">Wrapped</a> and other campaigns helped the service grow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oddly, Spotify's press release and investor presentation shows off a lot of non-music features prominently, signaling that the service may be growing due to its extra-curriculars. These include Wrapped, which Spotify reports saw 10% higher engagement than last year, and its closely-related AI DJ experience.</p><p>Additionally, the company called out its push on the video podcast front and the Spotify Partner Program — a way for audio and video creators to earn on the platform, like competing platforms TikTok and YouTube offer.</p><p>Spotify didn't mention <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio">the state of its lossless audio project</a>, which was announced in 2021 and missed its target release window with few updates. Tidal and Apple Music have offered high-fidelity audio for year, eclipsing Spotify in this regard despite Spotify's market dominance.</p><p>The company expects its growth to continue in the first quarter of 2025, when it projects to add two million Premium subscribers.</p>

<ul><li>Alphabet sees a 12% revenue increase year-over-year in Q4 2024.</li><li>CEO Sundar Pichai says this was a strong quarter "driven by our leadership in AI and the momentum across the business."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced a 12% revenue increase <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q4-2023-earnings-report">year-over-year</a> to $96.47 billion in Q4 2024. The company's revenue at the end of its fiscal year totaled $350 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year.</p><p>The company's shares fell nearly 7% after the trading day Tuesday.</p><p>Operating income was $30.97 billion, up from $23.69 billion in the same period last year. Net income was reported at $26.53 billion, up from $20.68 billion in the same period from the previous year. <br><br>Google Service's revenues increased to $84.1 billion in the quarter, a 10% increase from the same period a year ago. The company said this is a reflection of "strong momentum across Google Search & other and YouTube ads."</p><p>The company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/a3/91/6d1950c148fa84c7d699abe05284/2024q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf" target="_blank">in the earnings statement</a> that the quarter was strong "driven by our leadership in AI and the momentum across the business."</p><p>"We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficients," he said.</p><p>"In Search, advances like AI Overviews and Circle to Search are increasing user engagement. Our AI-powered Google Cloud portfolio is seeing stronger customer demand, and YouTube continues to be the leader in streaming watchtime and podcasts."</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-google-parent-alphabet-stock-ahead-of-earnings-q4-fy-2024-8784161" target="_blank">Investopedia</a>, Bank of America analysts told clients that based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings#:~:text=Meta%20announced%20its%20Q4%202024,%244.9%20billion%20in%20operating%20costs." target="_blank">Meta's strong results last week</a> (where most of its plans were on AI spending), Alphabet also has positive momentum.</p><p>Analysts from BoA and Raymond James indicate that because of the boom of DeepSeek, Google may "push the tech giant to act with greater urgency on AI developments."</p><p>Pichai did not respond directly to the increase of interest in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> or its launch but addressed that Google has been working hard to push development on its AI.</p><p>"I think, you know, part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space, you know, it's as big as it comes. And that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment," he noted during the earnings call.</p><p>An email from Investing.com indicated the company saw a shortfall in its earnings "driven by slower Google Cloud growth," which highlights the "challenges of scaling its enterprise business amid fierce competition from Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure."</p><p>While the company has been pushing forward with AI investments, the drop in the market after hours "reflects investor disappointment."</p><p>"The street is demanding clearer timelines on when AI spending translates to earnings and sales growth, not just promises. The reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue. For Alphabet to reassure investors, it needs to demonstrate that its AI bets, from Gemini models to Workspace integrations, can reignite Cloud momentum while core advertising remains stable in an uncertain economy," the note read.</p><p>When asked how AI can be monetized in the future, Pichai indicated that the company has very good ideas for native ad concepts and will give people options over time, but that this year, Google will stay focused on the subscription direction.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung subtly indicated that it will not be providing monthly updates to its Galaxy S21 series.</li><li>Since the series was destined for 4 years of full software updates, it means One UI 7 is its last.</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 FE still makes the cut for monthly updates, given its later release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank"> Galaxy S25 series</a> recently launched with seven years worth of updates, which should begin with monthly security updates. However, anyone with the Galaxy S21 series will start noticing a slowdown in update cadence just four years after the phone's launch.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb" target="_blank">security updates post</a>, Samsung lays out the devices that will get monthly, quarterly, and bi-annual updates. As recently spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/samsung-galaxy-s21-monthly-updates-end/">9to5Google</a>, the S21 series will now be downgraded to quarterly updates.</p><p>Monthly, quarterly, and biannual firmware security updates include patches for Android OS-related security issues released by Google, as well as patches for Samsung-specific security issues.</p><p>This change in update cadence will impact the standard Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and Ultra models since they were. However, owners should note that the phones are still expected to receive the massive One UI 7 update, as they were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-now-offers-four-years-security-updates">promised four years of OS upgrades</a> after launching with Android 11. This will bring a revamped UI and perhaps additional Galaxy AI features in tandem with the latest flagship models. So, the S21 owners still have something to be excited about.</p><p>That said, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-moves-step-closer-launch"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe">Galaxy S21 FE</a> was launched later in 2021, so it will continue to receive monthly updates for now, along with all subsequent S series models, starting from S22 until the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>Some of the other devices still eligible for monthly security updates include the following models: Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G, Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G, Galaxy Z Fold 4, Galaxy Z Flip 4, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Flip 6, W23, W23 Flip, W24, W24 Flip, W25, W25 Flip, Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition and Enterprise Models starting with the Galaxy A53 5G.</p><p>Along with these phone-related updates, Samsung is releasing a security patch for its wearables as well, listed below:</p>
<ul><li>Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</li><li>Galaxy Watch 5, Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</li><li>Galaxy Watch 6, Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</li><li>Galaxy Watch FE</li><li>Galaxy Watch 7</li><li>Galaxy Watch Ultra</li></ul>
<p>As for the Galaxy S21, owners should continue to see updates last until sometime in early 2026, although it's unlikely it'll receive the next major Android release.</p>

It often seems to forget that people want to use Google Search and don't care about ads or AI or any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-update-brings-2-0-flash-experimental-model-and-google-home-photos-extensions-to-ios-app">other things Google loves to do</a>. Google became successful because it was so good at searching.</p><p>The company just sent out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-widget-customization-shortcut-option-spotted">tiny update to its Search widget</a>. It probably isn't the kind of update you're thinking of because it's not about shoving AI down your throat; it's a small change that actually improves the widget. It's been testing the update since last fall, and it seems like nothing is broken.</p>
<p>You can now set up a custom shortcut for your widget that adds a new icon to the bar and its associated behavior — unless you use a Pixel, of course, because that persistent bar on your screen hasn't changed even though these settings seem like they should be there, too.</p><p>Anyhoo, you can now set up the Search widget to translate text, translate via the camera, search for the name of a song, search the weather, search sports news, act as a dictionary, search finance and stock prices, and help with your homework.

<p>With many changes to the things your phone does and how it works, you'll find a lot of disgruntled people who hate them. That's why adding options instead of outright changing a behavior or feature is the better way. If you don't care about any of these custom shortcuts, you don't have to add one.</p><p>The real problem is that you probably didn't know they were there or had any idea how to get to the settings.

<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out an update for its enrolled testers experimenting with "Ask Photos" in the Photos app.</li><li>The "Ask" tab introduced in the beta no longer drops users into Gemini, instead, it offers suggestions and other photo/video options with the AI.</li><li>Google started its test of Ask Photos in September and its waitlist is still open for those interested.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems Google is rolling out an update for its AI-powered feature in Photos that makes it a little easier to manage.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/google-photos-gemini-search-ui/">9to5Google</a>, the app's "Ask Photos" feature, which leverages Gemini, is picking up a slight UI rework for its testers. Update 7.14 is changing the newly introduced "Ask" tab at the bottom of the app. Tapping it displays a completely reconfigured page that offers more options rather than tossing you directly into a chat with Gemini. Now, users will see a slightly reduced search bar and an "Ask" button beside it.</p><p>Beneath this is a change — or, rather, a reversion — to what testers reportedly experienced at the beginning: a panel of suggestions. The latest experimental version adds a list of suggested actions users can ask the AI to perform. It seems that these suggestions are based on content within your collections and albums in the Photos app.</p><p>Gemini's "Ask Photos" can dig into your screenshots or a specific timespan of photos you've taken. Additionally, the AI can go into your videos and favorites if you desire.</p><p>If users are interested in chatting with Gemini directly, tapping the button produces a slightly retuned chat. Users will now have a clean UI, minus their profile icon at the top right. Under the star, there are reportedly a few suggestions to help users get started. The "Try Asking" section gives users ideas about their photos and it also goes off on a tangent with "Write a funny poem about me."</p><p>These changes are reportedly rolling out to all users enrolled in the "Ask Photos" test in Photos in the U.S.</p>

<p>We've been expecting "Ask Photos" to drop ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini">Google teased it</a> during I/O 2024. Several months later, in September, the feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">finally arrived experimentally</a>, opening its waitlist for interested testers in the U.S. One of the headliners for this feature was Gemini's ability to "understand the context" of your photo gallery. This means that the AI should be able to recognize the people you're looking for, as well as food and other objects/items.</p><p>In the event that Gemini gets it wrong (which is possible), Google encourages users to add additional details to help it.</p><p>Aside from surfacing memories for you, Ask Photos can also create a collage of images for you from a recent trip or from whenever.</p><p>The waitlist for Ask Photos is still in testing, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/#ask-photos">its waitlist is still open</a> and ready to enter your email address.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is updating Galaxy Buds Manager control widgets ahead of One UI 7's widespread rollout.</li><li>The widget takes up more space on your home screen by default, and shows less information when collapsed.</li><li>While the update is already appearing for some, it might not be available immediately for your device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is tweaking the look of Galaxy Buds Manager widgets with an OTA update, and some users aren't happy. The design aligns with current One UI trends, but makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> control widgets bigger by default — and show fewer bits of information when manually collapsed.</p><p>The update is now rolling out as part of Galaxy Buds 3 Pro Manager v7.0 for some users, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-3-pro-widget-update-one-ui-7-design/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. While starting with the newest and highest-priced Buds 3 Pro, it's likely that this change is reflected across the full suite of Galaxy Buds Manager apps in the near future. The new widget has more rounded corners, taking an oval shape with a translucent look and an opacity that can still be customized.</p><p>The default widget is larger than the old one, and still shows the same amount of information. Unfortunately, the 4x1 and 2x1 sizes of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro control widget show less information, no longer providing the device name or full noise control slider. This was negatively received by some users of the One UI subreddit, as described by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1ihksku/new_buds_manager_widget_change_is_the_only/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1ihksku/new_buds_manager_widget_change_is_the_only">New Buds manager widget: Change is the only constant but this is just bs!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>There are some neat changes that come with the refreshed Galaxy Buds 3 Pro control widget. For starters, you can now choose between one of three options for background coloring: light, dark, and match phone setting. Previously, the options for white and black backgrounds were combined with an intensity slider. Now, there are separate toggles for background color and an opacity slider.</p><p>While the official Google Play Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.accessory.paranmgr" target="_blank">listing</a> shows the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro Manager app was recently updated, it may take a while for it to appear on your device. Android Central tested the change with Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> on One UI 7, as well as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> on One UI 6 — but the update was not available for either device yet. It also wasn't available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/04/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-one-ui-7-control-widget/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> over-the-air.</p><p>The reception to this change will almost certainly be mixed. It'll make the Galaxy Buds Manager control widgets blend in with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, but also arguably places form over function.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is kicking off February with multiple updates across its Pixels, Play Store, and Android systems.</p><p>To begin, Google posted its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/322457106/google-pixel-update-february-2025?hl=en&sjid=7989698189977629535-NC">patch notes</a> for the February 2024 security updates for its line of Pixel devices. This month's security patch will arrive for devices ranging from the Pixel 6 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> (including its Fold and Tablet) as version <strong>AP4A.250205.002</strong> globally.</p><p>This month's patch notes are relatively light. Google states its Pixel devices will fixes for "audio output in Android Auto under certain conditions." According to its changelog, this fix involves every eligible Pixel device for the February patch.</p><p>Additionally, the patch brings the following Bluetooth fix: "occasionally preventing connection with certain Bluetooth devices or accessories." Google says this was an issue primarily on the entire Pixel 9 series, meaning those users should now find relief.</p><p>Those with a Pixel device under T-Mobile will see vAP4A.250205.002.C1 for the Pixel 9 series. Pixel 7 devices up to the Pixel 9 under Telstra will find vAP4A.250205.002.B2 and the Pixel 6 series in EMEA will find vAP4A.250205.002.A1.</p><p>In other news, Google detailed its wave of early February updates on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">a support page</a>, which begins by highlighting a couple of updates for the Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/february-2025-google-system-updates/">9to5Google</a>). The changelog states there's an update rolling out for "Tablet pQuality" titled "version 3." Google says this patch "updates the system to evaluate the app quality on tablets and ChromeOS devices."</p><p>There are also a few UI updates on deck for the Play Store for users creating a Game Profile. These updates are reportedly arriving for Android phones as v44.8 of the Play Store.</p><p>Several updates are arriving for Play Services, which can be seen below.</p>
<ul><li>[Developers - Auto] New developer features for Google and third-party app developers to support machine learning and AI-related processes in their apps.</li><li>[Account Management - Phones] With the new entry point for Family Link in Google Settings, you can now manage your family group more easily.</li><li>[Utilities - Phones] New developer features for Google and third-party app developers to support utilities-related processes in their apps.</li><li>[Connectivity - Phone, TV, Wear OS, Auto] Bug fixes for device connection-related services.</li><li>[Connectivity - Phone] With this new feature, you can continue your Quick Share transfers over Wi-Fi or mobile data even if the sender or receiver loses direct connection.</li></ul>

<p>One important note to keep in mind is that this February security patch should tackle a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-zero-day-exploit-february-2024-detailed">crucial zero-day Android exploit</a>. The company recently detailed that the issue, marked as CVE-2024-53104, attacks the Android OS at its Linux kernel and gives the attacker free rein to harm your device, causing instability. Early on, there were reportedly "indications" of this being a real threat, thus the fix that's rolling in for February.</p><p>Google stated that the problem was "limited" and saw "targeted exploitation," but this is still something users should be aware of. Continue to check your Pixel device — and other Android devices as this plagues all — for the fix.</p>

<hr>
<p>Looks like one of China's exclusive flagship phones is making its way to India. Vivo's X200 Pro Mini is reportedly set for its launch outside home ground as early as Q2 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-vivo-x200-pro-mini-to-launch-in-india-by-q2-2025/">Smartprix</a>).</p><p>Prominent tipster Yogesh Brar took to X (previously Twitter) to talk about the X200 Pro Mini's arrival and said that the phone would cost close to 70,000 rupees, which is about $804. Considering the phone was already released in China in October last year, it is safe to say that we are more than aware of the specs this phone is said to come with.</p>

<p>The Vivo X200 Pro Mini is built with an aluminum alloy frame, weighing about 187g. When it comes to design, the Vivo X200 Pro Mini sports a 6.31" LTPO AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 1.5K resolution, and 4500 nits of peak brightness. It's not exactly "mini" but small enough to match other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">small Android phones</a> like the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>At the heart, it is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">MediaTek Dimensity 9400</a> chipset and comes equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.

The X200 Pro Mini comes with a triple camera setup with a 50MP main camera, a 50MP ultrawide lens, and a 50MP periscope telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom and 100x zoom.  On the front, it will get a 32MP ultrawide selfie camera capable of 4K video recording.</p>

<ul><li>Google is delivering a warning to Android users about a crucial zero-day exploit in the wild.</li><li>The issue can reportedly allow an attacker to cause widespread software instability and more if they've gained access to your phone.</li><li>Google has posted its February security patch notes, which includes a fix for the issue; however, OEMs are up next to deliver it to users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is warning Android users, including the Galaxy S25 and S24, of a critical Android software flaw.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/02/03/samsungs-android-update-bad-news-for-galaxy-s25-s24-owners/">Forbes</a>, Google has identified an issue within Android that could be under "targeted exploitation." Digging further, the publication states that this issue could let evil actors trigger memory instability, alter video frames, and more. The problem is reportedly labeled as CVE-2024-53104 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/02/03/google-warns-all-android-users-your-phone-is-now-at-risk/">another post</a> went into more detail.</p><p>This vulnerability was highlighted in Google's changelog for its monthly February <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-02-01">security patch</a>. The publication cites the company in saying the exploit "could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed." Additionally, this Android problem is attacking the OS at its Linux kernel, meaning it could widespread damage should an attacker gain access to your device.</p><p>While this is certainly dangerous, at the moment, the attacks are reportedly "limited" — but that doesn't mean you shouldn't update quickly once it's available.</p><p>The post highlights the Galaxy S25, considering its most recent One UI 7 patch only includes security updates up to December 2024. Samsung pushed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-january-2025-security-patch-is-rolling-out-for-a-long-list-of-galaxy-phones">January patch quite late</a> for the S24 series; however, that didn't involve this Android exploit.</p><p>As previously stated, this update plagues <em>every </em>Android device, so it's wise to update as soon as possible. With Google dropping the update, it's now sent to the respective OEMs to get it to users quickly.</p><p>Forbes adds that there's one more problematic bug involving devices with Qualcomm tech. This one appears to let attackers gain "remote access" to your device, but the publication says there aren't any victims yet. Nonetheless, a fix for that is likely soon.</p>

<p>Zero-day exploits (sadly) happen in the world of tech, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-chips-zero-day-targeted-android-confirmed">the issue Qualcomm ran into</a> in October. A few months ago, Qualcomm confirmed that there was a zero-day chip exploit running wild in the world of Android with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. The issues were "limited" and "targeted," so it refrained from causing widespread panic. The company was unsure of <em>who </em>the attacks were targeting; however, what was clear was that Google, Motorola, OnePlus, and others had devices involved.</p><p>The Google Threat Analysis Group provided "indications" that there was an issue running about user devices before passing it onto Qualcomm for confirmation. Aside from the SD 8 Gen 1, Qualcomm further concluded that the exploit affected 64 of its chips.</p><p>Luckily, the issue was patched a month before Qualcomm's official confirmation to the public.</p><p>Google was also busy in 2024 discussing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-report-zero-days-exploited-in-2023">97 zero-day vulnerabilities</a> that were exploited in 2023. It was a chunky rise of over 50% compared to 62 vulnerabilities from 2022. Most of those issues plagued Android phones, tablets, and operating systems.</p>

Plenty of others on the road don't offer that kind of luxury, and frankly, some aren't even that old. This was always the premise behind AAWireless as an adapter to bridge that gap. The AAWireless Two smooths out the rougher edges of the original and makes it easier to set up and use.</p><p>The main focus remains the same, which is to enable you to run wireless Android Auto where it's not possible. It's just that you can also share the connectivity with other drivers or passengers along the way.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-price-and-availability"><span>AAWireless Two: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zRyRFmjEGqbLhRgSrhqj2o" name="AAWireless-Two-box" alt="AAWireless Two Android Auto adapter with USB cable and box." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zRyRFmjEGqbLhRgSrhqj2o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AAWireless Two first launched in October 2024 and, unlike its predecessor, didn't come with a crowdfunding campaign.  The best places to find it are on Amazon and its own website, where it sells for $65. The only catch is availability, which fluctuates based on inventory from the European manufacturer. That's cheaper than the original AAWireless, which has basically been retired.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-what-s-good"><span>AAWireless Two: What's good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pGiKAoZEjw8dEEod2PvpXW" name="AAWireless-Two-in-hand" alt="AAWireless Two Android Auto adapter in hand and plugged in." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pGiKAoZEjw8dEEod2PvpXW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most obvious difference in this second iteration is that it's about half the size of the previous model. That puts it more in line with what other brands, especially those based in China, are bringing to market. These types of dongles and adapters keep getting smaller.</p><p>As they slim down in size, they're becoming easier to set up and manage. Mind you, the "manage" part is very relative because most others are simple "set it and forget it" types. Not so with the AAWireless Two, which encourages usability and customization however it can provide it.</p><p>Much of that comes from the button on the device, whose main function is to switch between paired phones or place the connection on "standby."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="Z3PTqMunemtSa5prViLMu6" name="AAWireless-Two-app-screenshots" alt="Screenshots of AAWireless app showing firmware update and button configurations." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3PTqMunemtSa5prViLMu6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AAWireless even lets you map the buttons within the limited parameters available. The point is that it makes it significantly easier to pair multiple devices and swap between them while on the road. Not only should it make road trips or commutes simpler, but it also allows drivers sharing the same car to utilize the wireless Android Auto connection. The one catch here is anyone connecting to this must use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. There's no Apple CarPlay here (except an AAWireless Two Plus model supporting it is coming in 2025).</p><p>The LED ring light is highly visible and easy to interpret, with solid blue confirming a phone is connected and running Android Auto. A single or double-click can switch over to another phone — a process that's impressively quick.</p><p>I liked it all the more because the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/aawireless-review">AAWireless</a> came with inconsistent connectivity, particularly on ignition. That smoothed over with subsequent firmware updates, but this sequel is already off to a good start. From the initial setup to connection stability, the Two delivers.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's also pretty seamless to pair a second phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's also pretty seamless to pair a second phone. All I had to do was press and hold the button until it flashed purple (indicating pairing mode) and then pair the second phone via the Bluetooth settings. Once done, the app lets you choose which device to prioritize first every time, or you can opt to have it first go to whichever phone it last connected with.</p><p>The process is sturdy throughout, and I found just pressing the button on the adapter was good enough to switch phones when necessary. It also proves super convenient with phone calls in case your partner or passenger needs to make a call and wants to use the car stereo as a speaker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WX5vEEuht377wyAkNjXffQ" name="AAWireless-Two-phone-app" alt="Holding an Android phone running the AAWireless app showing home screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WX5vEEuht377wyAkNjXffQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app's settings include a slew of extra features and controls, most of which you probably won't even need to consider.</p><p>One is "Audio stutter fix," a setting you'll want to toggle on if you encounter audio issues at any time while using the AAWireless Two. That said, Android Auto is supposed to set the buffer for audio playback to ensure it keeps playing without fail. If there's a problem, setting it to "Unlimited" should solve it.</p><p>AAWireless also brings back Passthrough as a means to play around with defaults, like adjusting the DPI (dots per inch) displayed and more. There are several other options in the settings in the app, but the disclaimer notes to "please make sure you know what you're doing" before trying them.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-what-s-not-good"><span>AAWireless Two: What's not good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6" name="AAWireless-Two-adapter-next-screen" alt="AAWireless Two adapter next to aftermarket infotainment head unit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first few times, the AAWireless Two connects took longer than usual. The delay eventually corrects itself as things are set up but it is a bit jarring if you're used to more immediate access to Android Auto like you get with a wired connection.</p><p>Naturally, a wired connection means you're also charging your phone at the same time. If your car has a wireless charging pad, you can take advantage of that anytime. It's still a good idea to keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-android-auto">charging cables</a> inside to charge the device whenever you need them.</p><p>Make sure to keep a USB-C-to-USB-C cable handy in case your car doesn't have USB-A ports. The included cable here is only a short USB-C-to-USB-A. There's also no adhesive pad included to keep the adapter upright on the dash — less of an issue with the previous one but more important here because of the phone-switching feature.</p><p>Then there's general availability. Unlike other similar adapters, the AAWireless Two is manufactured in Europe, so inventory tends to come in waves, meaning you'll have to catch one to get your hands on this device.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-competition"><span>AAWireless Two: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-close-up.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter close-up stuck to dash." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's hard to look at the AAWireless Two and not conclude it's the best of the bunch right now. Even more so given its predecessor occupied that spot before. Still, there are other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories">dongles and devices that can run wireless Android Auto</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/motorola-ma1-review">Motorola MA1</a> is recognizable by the name, but it's since been outshone by others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/carsifi-review" target="_blank">Carsifi</a> is a good example; only app updates are like UFO sightings, and they're never around. But at least it lets you pair more than one phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/automotive/carlinkit-5-review" target="_blank">Carlinkit 5.0</a> is solid except for the clunky firmware update process and poorly written manual. It does the job if you only care to go wireless and never really interact with it thereafter.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aawireless-two-should-you-buy-it"><span>AAWireless Two: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K6MaBRXrWiQwKMA7XZ6UpK" name="AAWireless-Two-button" alt="Pressing the button on the AAWIreless Two Android Auto dongle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6MaBRXrWiQwKMA7XZ6UpK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want wireless Android Auto in a vehicle with no other option but wired Android Auto</li><li>You share your car with at least one other Android user</li><li>You want app support for tweaks and troubleshooting</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are fine with plugging in to run Android Auto</li><li>You don't have a wireless charger</li><li>You use iPhone</li></ul>
<p>Whether you're new to going wireless or have done it many times running Android Auto, what's not to like about it? I've used the word "liberating" before in the same context, and it feels just like that with the AAWireless Two.</p><p>Possibly more so because of how it seamlessly involves another user without any snags. In that sense, going wireless is already a win, and switching that privilege over to another is a win-win.</p>

Ideal for jotting down notes, sketching, or even simply more comfortable navigation than using your finger, it’s a handy tool for both work and play.</p><p>Samsung’s S Pens are among the best styli you can buy, but what if you want to use multiple S Pens on your device? Maybe you have an old one lying around that you want to keep at home while your new one stays at the office. Or perhaps you want to swap among multiple S Pens as needs require or to ensure you always have one ready to go if the other’s battery is dead.</p><p>Whatever the case, the process is not quite as simple as just pairing a new S Pen to the device. There are specific settings you need to adjust to make things work smoothly.</p>

<p>The process is a little different when it comes to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold phones, which count among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a>.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is the latest premium phone in the company’s line-up. But when it comes to the S Pen, Samsung made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">controversial change to the S Pen</a> that comes with this device. It does not use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which means you can’t leverage Air Actions, even if you already own (or decide to buy) a Samsung S Pen Pro.</p><p>It is still <em>technically </em>possible to use multiple S Pens with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, the process to do so requires a few extra steps. You would need to first pair the S Pen Pro with another compatible Samsung Galaxy device, which means having one on hand. Both the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the other Galaxy device also need to be signed into the same Samsung account. Once you do this, you can use the S Pen Pro across multiple devices within your arsenal, like a Samsung Galaxy tablet and a phone.</p>

<p>The great thing about the Samsung S Pen is that it works wonderfully with Samsung Galaxy devices. But there are several different models, some specific to a certain device, like the Fold edition. Some Galaxy devices come with an S Pen and in these cases, you’re best to use the S Pen that comes with it. But if there’s a viable reason you want to use other S Pens, there is a workaround in most cases. Follow the steps above, noting the limitations, and you should be off to the races.</p>

Mark Rabkin, who has had the title of VP of VR/MR since the Oculus Quest 2 launched in 2020, is passing the baton on to Ryan Cairns, who formerly led on Portal and Meta for Work initiatives. Cairns is expected to assume the full title of VP of VR/MR at the beginning of March and will report to Vishal Shah, who will remain VP of Metaverse.</p><p>In a letter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/mrabkin/posts/pfbid02UZ2ivLB5d1fXnGhckaTyy3jzYB5AsR9m65QNEFfeeDkGPaLDFbGoQgPVhMH771Vzl">shared on Facebook</a>, Rabkin describes his nearly two decades time at Meta as a "foundational, formative experience." Rabkin cites that his main reason for leaving is because of family health struggles at home, noting that he'll be taking some time off work rather than just moving to a different position inside the company.</p><p>Rabkin has helped shape the ecosystem that drives Meta Quest headsets over the past six years, including the transition from Oculus to Meta branding, steering the division to record revenues of over 1 billion dollars last quarter alone. He also shaped the transformation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta Horizon OS</a> from an Oculus-branded product to one that third parties will soon be using. At Meta Connect 2024, he was a big proponent of the recently launched Meta Quest 3S which is part of a 40% sales increase according to a leaked memo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reality-labs-sales-grew-40-in-2024-leaked-memo/">UploadVR</a>).</p><p>But Rabkin was also behind a controversial change last Fall to the Meta Horizon Store — the digital marketplace where Meta Quest users can purchase and download games and apps — which saw app curation replaced with what developers have described as "utter chaos." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">A bad update</a> this past Christmas also left many customers with a poor first impression of Meta Quest headsets. We expect some big changes as Ryan Cairns heads into the new position, starting with the Meta Horizon store.</p>
<h2 id="big-changes-on-the-horizon-2">Big changes on the Horizon</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bCwDwsXy9wxPf4ecwDjVrP" name="Meta-Quest-3S-Yoges-Elite-Strap-01" alt="The Yoges Y14 Elite Strap with battery on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCwDwsXy9wxPf4ecwDjVrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Horizon ecosystem has seen massive changes over the past year and we expect Shah's promotion to usher in even more. Since the Meta Horizon OS announcement last April, we've seen the Meta Quest app change names to Meta Horizon and get a huge facelift, Meta's Horizon metaverse (we're confused too) become a prominent promotional part of the Meta Quest, and the app store's curation model get completely removed.</p><p>The previous content curation headed by Meta's Director of Games, Chris Pruett, was axed in favor of a more "open" ecosystem last Summer. Previously, apps and games only appeared on the main Meta store if Meta approved them. This model created problems because Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-user-reviews">lack of transparency</a> meant developers rarely understood why their apps or games were approved or rejected. Meta often relegated unapproved games to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/quest-app-lab-more-doubles-official-store-almost-850-apps-within-year">App Lab</a>, making them difficult to find and monetize.</p><p>Pruett came under fire several times because his own development studio, Robot Invader, had no problem getting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/dead-secret-circle/">Dead Secret</a> series of games approved on the store more than once. After years of complaints from developers, Meta abandoned its content curation methods in favor of a wild west approach, spearheaded by Rabkin and paraded heavily at Meta Connect 2024.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Horizon store went from heavy curation under lock and key to the wild west in a few short months, and developers aren't happy about the whiplash.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Developer and customer response to the change has been less than positive. Over the past few months, I've spoken with several developers who feel their game has "been buried" on the Quest store by dozens of Gorilla Tag clones that flood the store every day. Meta has also heavily promoted its Meta Horizon "metaverse" app, which is built into every Quest headset, over other paid apps and games on the store.</p><p>It has left a bad taste in some developers' mouths and customers aren't happy with the new curation options, either. Over the past few months, I've seen many people on social media ask why they're being served Horizon Worlds content instead of big-name games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/behemoth-hands-on">Behemoth</a>, and Alien Rogue Incursion.</p><p>But if you think this era of Meta Horizon store curation is about to end, think again.</p>

<p>Mark Rabkin's successor, Ryan Cairns, will report to Vishal Shah, the man who has been in charge of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">the Metaverse</a> since Mark Zuckerberg introduced the concept in August 2021. The grandiose presentation was always underscored with an "eventually" clause and the company was ridiculed for years because Zuckerberg's vision is proving to be a difficult task to achieve.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/boztank/3560193565323649208/">most recent Instagram AMA</a>, Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth answered a question directed at the future of Horizon Worlds and the Metaverse the company has been trying to build. Boz admitted that "I think we had to get a lot of a lot more pieces in place than we thought when we started," in relation to executing on the vision of the Metaverse and, more specifically, the successful rollout of Horizon Worlds.</p><p>Boz went on to say that the metaverse concept as a whole is already alive and well among gamers. "People are already having very Metaverse experiences in Fortnite, in Roblox, in all these other platforms." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-next-generation-is-already-living-in-the-metaverse">I also wrote about this</a> before Fortnite started calling itself a metaverse platform, and now Meta has to push hard to get Horizon Worlds to be even a fraction as popular as Roblox or Fortnite currently are.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It is about filling our products with "Give A Damn". This is about having pride in our work.</p><figcaption><cite>Andrew Bosworth, CTO of Meta</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>That push all starts with <em>mobile</em>, not VR or MR. In a memo leaked to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2?ref=uploadvr.com">Business Insider</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-cto-to-staff-leaked-memo-2025-year-of-greatness/">UploadVR</a>), Boz outlined that 2025 "likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure." It's a fiery line that echoes what Mark Zuckerberg just said in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">Meta's latest earnings report</a> when he touted that 2025 would be a "pivotal year for the metaverse."</p><p>Boz's memo touched on the importance of small teams pulling off "operational excellence and master craftsmanship," almost certainly alluding to the botched rollout of an update that bricked Meta Quest headsets over Christmas break and caused Meta to have to replace them for free.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If I can expect anything for the Meta Quest in 2025, it's the launch of lots of new, big ideas and the decoupling of the idea that the metaverse has to somehow be experienced solely in VR.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>"It is about filling our products with 'Give A Damn'. This is about having pride in our work." The "give a damn" quote is a reference to the shocking letter the previous CTO, John Carmack, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0iPixEvPJQGzNa6t2x6HUL5TYqfmKGqSgfkBg6QaTyHF5frXQi7eLGxC7uPQv5U5jl&id=100006735798590&mibextid=qC1gEa&_rdr">posted on social media</a> when he resigned in December 2022. The company didn't care enough about its products back then, urged Carmack, and it seems that Boz is noticing that enough hasn't changed in the two years since then.</p><p>Does this mean we'll see a leaner Meta Quest development team that is quicker to respond to criticism? Almost certainly, yes. But it also means that Meta will be, undoubtedly, pushing its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform just as hard or even harder than it did in 2024.</p><p>After all, what use it is in putting the man in charge of the Metaverse in charge of <em>everything</em> VR and MR if the fulfillment of a long-term vision isn't in sight? If I can expect anything for the Meta Quest in 2025, it's the launch of lots of new, big ideas and the decoupling of the idea that the metaverse has to somehow be experienced solely in VR.</p>
<p><em>Correction: The original article stated that Vishal Shah would replace Mark Rabkin. However, Android Central later learned that Ryan Cairns will take Rabkin's title and will report to Vishal Shah, the current VP of Metaverse.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>OpenAI has unveiled a new AI agent for ChatGPT that cranks out detailed research reports in no time. Think of it as your fast pass to pro-level insights, removing the need to wait around for ages to get the info you need.</p><p>OpenAI’s Deep Research is designed to take on tough research tasks by diving into multi-step investigations across the web. It slashes the time needed for deep research, pulling off in minutes what used to take hours of manual work (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/openai-chatgpt-deep-research-3522437/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Mimicking the careful process of a human analyst, it scours, sorts, and blends tons of online sources to spit out detailed, well-rounded reports, according to OpenAI's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p><p>Once you give Deep Research a solid prompt and iron out a few quick details, it gets to work on its own, crunching data behind the scenes. While it might take anywhere from five to 30 minutes to finish, OpenAI says this smart system can smash through hours of human research in just a fraction of the time.</p><p>With rivals, especially Chinese companies like DeepSeek, heating up the race, OpenAI’s launch of Deep Research is a big leap forward in building smarter, more independent AI tools.</p><p>Built on OpenAI’s upcoming o3 model, Deep Research is designed for professionals who need solid, in-depth insights. Whether you're in finance, science, policy, or engineering, this tool helps tackle heavy research with accuracy and reliability.</p><p>This AI agent works on its own, mapping out and executing multi-step research while staying flexible enough to backtrack and adapt to real-time info when needed.</p><p>Rather than solely producing text, this AI lays out its whole research process in a sidebar—citations, methodology, and all—so you see exactly how it got there.</p><p>Deep Research looks ready to shake up knowledge work, bringing big benefits to its users. The features it offers seem pretty similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>'s Deep Research too.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">rolled out its own version last year for subscribers</a>, aiming to cut research time down to minutes instead of hours. OpenAI's Deep Research seems to be chasing the same goal.</p><p>Deep Research is currently available on the web for ChatGPT Pro subscribers, costing $200 a month, with a cap of 100 queries per month.</p>

<p>Samsung's latest plus-sized flagship is here, and the Galaxy S25 Plus stacks up nicely with the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Of course, the comparisons between Pixel and Galaxy phones aren't always equal. While both the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 lineups each include three models, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is comparable to both the midsize Galaxy S25 Plus and the top-tier Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>At $999, the 6.7-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a> is a tough competitor for the $1,099 6.8-inch Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is the reigning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phone</a>. The Galaxy S25 Plus has the better processor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> has the better camera, and both have excellent software.</p><p>So, which one should you buy? That's what this comparison will help you find out, so let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-display-home-screen-01" alt="Comparing the display and home screens of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's only a tenth of an inch separating the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Pixel 9 Pro XL in terms of screen sizes, but you wouldn't know it from their overall form factor. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is thinner, lighter, and more compact than the Pixel 9 Pro XL — and significantly so. For instance, the former weighs just 190 grams, while the latter weighs 221 grams. The Pixel is also more than a full millimeter thicker than the Galaxy.</p><p>Put simply, you will notice and feel the size difference between these two phones. If you prefer a more compact handset, you'll like the Galaxy S25 Plus, which measures 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm. Those who like the hefty and large feel of a premium flagship might prefer the Pixel 9 Pro XL, measuring 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm.</p><p>Both designs follow industry trends, now preferring largely rectangular chassis with slight chamfers rather than curvy shells. Both phones also feature matte back glass finishes, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL has polished sides while the Galaxy S25 Plus has matte aluminum rails.</p>

<p>From the back, the iconic Pixel camera housing is hard to miss on the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's pill-shaped and is kind of a dust and lint magnet, especially if you use your phone caseless. The rear lenses on the Galaxy S25 Plus are separate and now feature DSLR-style lens covers that differentiate it and older models.</p><p>In terms of the display, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the larger 6.8-inch AMOLED panel. It's equipped with 120Hz support and variable refresh rate capabilities, just like the Galaxy S25 Plus. The Galaxy S25 Plus is smaller, with a 6.7-inch AMOLED, and includes a ProScaler that uses software to make the Galaxy's display look sharper. Both phones are covered by Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on top of their screens.</p>

<p>There are advantages to both the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Pixel 9 Pro XL's respective approaches to hardware. Samsung went with raw power in the Galaxy S25 Plus, since it's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset and paired with 12GB of RAM. The collaborative chip between Samsung and Qualcomm is the most powerful Android processor to date, beating even the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite platform.</p><p>Regardless of which benchmark you pick, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9 Pro XL will lose to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. However, Google is optimizing everything in the Pixel 9 Pro XL, from the silicon to the display and software. That gives it an edge in efficiency. Unfortunately, Google lost its lead in AI processing — the Tensor G4 chip can only handle 45 tokens per second for AI tasks, while the Snapdragon 8 Elite can do 70 tokens per second.</p><p>Both phones are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based, and both come with a promise of seven years of OS upgrades. Samsung uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which is unique but is more similar to Google's build of Android than ever. Pixel Launcher is truly Google's vision for Android, and it lacks some of Samsung's unnecessary bloat.</p>

<p>Samsung and Google both upgraded the connectivity offerings on their newest flagships. Both are equipped with Wi-Fi 7, mmWave 5G, NFC, and UWB support. The Galaxy S25 Plus has the edge in Bluetooth connectivity, with 5.4 as opposed to 5.3 for the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tYC9X6Lo2GHhMqWT4oUQnV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-back-corners-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the camera islands of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tYC9X6Lo2GHhMqWT4oUQnV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It feels like the same story every year for Galaxy flagships: the camera system is holding the Galaxy S25 Plus back. It uses the same sensors as the Galaxy S24 Plus, Galaxy S23 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Plus. The lack of upgrades here is astounding, and it only helps the Pixel 9 Pro XL's case. To recap, the Galaxy S25 Plus includes the following sensors: a 50MP main, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide.</p><p>Basically, all Google had to do over the last few years of Pixel development is keep making upgrades, and it has. The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a great camera system with a 50MP main shooter and dual 48MP secondary cameras. There's a 48MP ultrawide and another 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom support. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a better fit to compete with the Galaxy S25 Ultra than the Galaxy S25 Plus, despite it only costing $100 more than the latter.</p><p>Google wins the front camera battle, too, since the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 48MP front-facing, hole-punch sensor. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Plus has a 12MP front sensor.</p>

<p>This is a rare case of two phones that both have excellent value propositions, each for a different type of smartphone user. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is thinner, lighter, and more compact than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, so it's ideal for those who want a small phone without sacrificing too many features. The camera system could be better, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is standout.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a superior camera system with excellent computational photography. The phone's 6.8-inch screen may be the perfect middle ground between the Galaxy S25 Plus and the massive Galaxy S25 Ultra. Of course, it has Google AI at the core and the Pixel Launcher, so the software is excellent.</p><p>All told, you can't really go wrong with either of these phones. However, considering how similar the Galaxy S25 Plus is to the Galaxy S24 Plus, you may want to check if the predecessor could give you what you're looking for on a budget. We have that comparison for you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-galaxy-s24-plus">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Pixel phones, along with other Android phones, have incorporated a Wi-Fi calling feature for over a couple of years now. It works in conjunction with the device's carrier to ensure users have a smoother calling experience. Pixel phones, however, may soon remind users to enable the feature if it is not enabled already.</p><p>The feature was spotted in an APK teardown performed by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phones-remind-wi-fi-calling-apk-teardown-3521529/">Android Authority</a> for the Adaptive Connectivity Services app bearing version <strong>p.2025.01</strong>. Based on identified strings in the app's backend, Google could soon notify Pixel owners to enable Wi-Fi calling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="g2p3qwKfPnzfPZKFZVCKf" name="pixel-3a-wifi-calling.jpg" alt="Wi-Fi calling on an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2p3qwKfPnzfPZKFZVCKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The notification description further reads, "Turn on Wi-Fi calling to talk and text in places where the mobile network isn't as strong." The publication further notes that it is still unclear whether Google would send users the notification only when Wi-Fi calling is disabled or when it detects that the user is in a poor or no network area. Either way, users will soon see a "turn on" pop-up with the new notification and also can "dismiss" it.</p><p>Users who are new to Pixel phones and not so tech-savvy might find the new notification quite useful. However, not all Pixel phones in all regions support the Wi-Fi calling feature, since it is highly dependent on the respective carriers and Google itself; that's one thing to keep in mind.</p><p>If you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> series phone or any other Pixel phone that supports the Wi-Fi calling feature, it could soon come to your handset via the aforementioned app update, which could be in a couple of weeks or months, as it still appears to be in the testing phase. We recommend you stay up to date with the Adaptive Connectivity Services app version to notice the new, nifty notification feature.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It's easy to think that the best phones in 2025 are growing stale. The product category has matured over the past two decades, and many updates are incremental. For instance, the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 lineup</a> with a few tweaks. Similar things can be said about the latest iPhones and newest Pixels, to a lesser degree.</p><p>In fact, Android Central's resident phone expert, Nicholas Sutrich, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/north-american-smartphone-market-2025-predictions-expectations" target="_blank">previewed the market for smartphones in 2025</a> at the end of last year with an outlook that could be described as depressing. He's right. For most phone buyers in North America, this year will be just like the last one — filled with incremental updates, rising prices, and little variety.</p>

<p>Here's the thing: it doesn't have to be this way. Smartphone buyers in the U.S. specifically silo themselves when buying their handsets, often sticking to a handful of mobile carriers and even fewer phone brands. It's a phenomenon that seems to only exist in North America.</p><p>Put simply, buying smartphones through carrier contracts is a bad idea. It limits your options, restricts your flexibility, and can end up costing you more in the long run. It's easy to see how.</p><p>Samsung routinely offers boosted trade-in values for phones, but you can't take advantage of them unless your phone is paid off. Want to pay your phone off early to maximize your trade-in value? You'll likely lose all the discounts and promotions you got when you bought your current phone from your carrier.</p><p>A similar situation occurs if you break your phone and don't have insurance. Say your phone is too damaged to fix and you need a new one — you could be hit with a massive bill that includes the amount needed to pay off your current phone, plus the price of a new one and any carrier fees that apply.</p><p>Those are just a few reasons that you might want to consider buying a phone outright in 2025 rather than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-phone-carrier">purchasing it from a mobile network provider</a> — like AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon. But there are other reasons, like the availability of more phone brands and models beyond what you see in your carrier stores. Based on what I've seen from the phone market in late 2024 and early 2025, there are lots of exciting and fun smartphones available if you look beyond the restrictions imposed by carriers.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R are two great phones to start with because they're sensible options. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a $900 phone with hardware that can match or beat the $1,299 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which is pretty exciting to me. On top of that, the phone has IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 protection</a> against dust and water ingress. In other words, you can stick the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher, and it should survive (though we don't recommend you try it).</p><p>The OnePlus 13 isn't the only phone in 2025 that can survive a dishwasher run. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> is dishwasher-safe as well, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">I saw it used as a cutting board, too</a>. If that isn't fun, I honestly don't know what is.</p><p>Back to the <em>sensible</em> nature of this section, it's hard to forget the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. It delivers flagship specs for $600, and that's downright cool. I think there are many people in North America that have been conditioned by Apple and Samsung to think that flagships have to cost $1,000 or above. In 2025, that couldn't be more wrong. There has never been a time when $500 or $600 could get you more in a smartphone.</p><p>As a phone reviewer, I often test out a variety of review units each year. But I also buy way too many phones and other gadgets with my own money, and I've never been more conflicted about which one to buy. The OnePlus 13 is the sensible option, like I said, although there are many others that fit the "fun" bill better.</p>

<p>One of those devices is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-is-the-best-gaming-phone-and-its-here-in-the-us">came to the U.S. in January</a> and is simply a beastly and unique gaming phone. The ROG Phone 9 Pro has a loud design with nods to ASUS' gaming aesthetic, but things really get crazy with "Anime Vision." That's what ASUS calls the LED display on the back of ROG Phone 9 Pro, which includes 648 individual white and red LEDs.</p><p>You can put logos, text, and other designs on the back of your smartphone with the ROG Phone 9 Pro. If you're not impressed yet, the ROG Phone 9 Pro's back LED display can actually be used to play retro-style mini-games and show your phone's battery percentage. From a hardware perspective, the ROG Phone 9 Pro has a 3.5mm headphone jack and <em>two</em> USB-C ports designed to connect to accessories like controllers or a cooling fan.</p><p>Seriously, anyone who thinks phones aren't fun nowadays isn't looking hard enough. The ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro is one of the most fun devices I've ever seen, and I might pay over $1,000 just to get my hands on one.</p>

<p>Finally, I think it's worth emphasizing how much flair and customization can be added to phones, especially those sold outside the U.S. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-spark-30-bumblebee-edition-hands-on">TECNO Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition</a> is designed like a Transformer, which is insanely cool for robot nerds like myself. If superheroes are more your style, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">Poco X7 Pro Iron Man edition</a>, which needs no introduction.</p><p>No matter what kind of smartphone buyer you are, there's a "fun" device for you in 2025. Like a super durable smartphone? The OnePlus 13 is right for you. Need a flagship on a budget? Don't count out the OnePlus 13R. Want a phone so cool it gets into ludicrous hardware territory? That's the ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro, plain and simple. Want to express your fandoms without a case or skin? The Bumblebee or Iron Man phones are insanely neat.</p><p>It's true that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> from brands like Samsung or Google can get boring. However, it would be a mistake to limit yourself to those companies or to whatever your cellular carrier offers. There's a whole lot of phones out there, and they're more fun than ever.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's latest Ultra device comes to Zack Nelson's table for a durability test.</li><li>The test revealed that Samsung passed the test with a stronger build and better screen than before.</li><li>It also showcases that the device's new camera rings are incorporated for aesthetic purposes.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series will likely be delivered to users starting February 3 for those who've pre-ordered. This means more reviews are likely to surface about the trio, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. While we await, JerryRigEverything's durability test is now out, showcasing the build and some cons of the Ultra handset.</p><p>YouTuber Zack Nelson begins his latest durability test video by discussing how companies like Apple and Samsung are sticking to the Titanium builds that their phones have incorporated over the past couple of years; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> features the same and looks better than before.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kN9YYURZD5Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Later in the video, when the handset is compared to its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>, it is evident how familiar both flagships look, except for the slightly rounded corners that the Galaxy S25 Ultra features.</p><p>Nelson further examines the new S-Pen, now downgraded with the removal of low-power Bluetooth functionality — used for gestures and its button, which was previously utilized as a click button to take photos with the handset's cameras.</p><p>Since the S-Pen doesn't require an inbuilt battery with the omission of the aforementioned features, it still has a battery slot, which can be seen in the video as Nelson snaps it into pieces.</p>
<p>Turning to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's screen, the Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2 protection adequately protects it from scratches, as the most visible ones are seen in level 7 of Nelson's scratch test.</p><p>Moving to the controversial aspect of the device, its camera rings are fixed with some kind of glue on top of the lenses, which is visible in the durability test video. Nelson manages to remove the metal rings, which appear to serve only aesthetic purposes for the Galaxy S25 Ultra's design.</p><p>Additionally, those rings are slightly elevated on the rear panel, which means they can easily accumulate dust underneath, and cleaning them often would be a nightmare. Lastly, the popular bend test has also been performed by Nelson; the S25 Ultra seems to have passed the test with flying colors.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the weekend, we learned that Apple reportedly canceled plans to make a pair of AR glasses that would operate by connecting to a Mac computer. The glasses were seen as a sort of "Apple Vision Lite," as they were powered by the same operating system inside the expensive Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/apple-scraps-work-on-mac-connected-augmented-reality-glasses">Bloomberg</a>'s original report noted that executives weren't impressed with the product, citing performance issues and ever-changing feature requests. These glasses originally required pairing to an iPhone, but that was later changed to a Mac as they drained the phone's battery too fast and required too much processing power for a phone.</p><p>The news comes on the one-year anniversary of the Apple Vision Pro, a product that has been met with waning consumer interest given the extremely high $3,500 price tag. Given Apple's woes with XR products — XR is the umbrella term for anything AR, VR, and beyond — critics are saying that this is yet another death knell for the category as a whole. As usual, though, they couldn't be more wrong.</p>

<p>I'm writing this article from my laptop while wearing a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">Xreal One</a> glasses. I'm not using my laptop's display because I'm at my kitchen table, a place that's not ergonomically designed to work from. Unless I want severe neck pain by the end of the day, wearing my Xreal One glasses and working from a giant virtual screen is the best preventative medicine.</p><p>Apple realized this was the best possible scenario for a smart display glasses product after its initial R&D attempts on a phone. I don't buy for a minute that a phone "wasn't powerful enough" to run this experience. Today's smartphones are powered by what are essentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">laptop-grade processors</a>. Maybe the phone's battery life was an issue, but even that seems questionable.</p><p>Rather, I think Apple understood that having a phone in your hand connected to a pair of smart display glasses simply doesn't make any sense. There are very few scenarios I can think of where connecting smart glasses to a phone is an ideal experience. Gaming and watching videos are brilliant when viewing from a pair of smart glasses, and your neck and back will thank you for not holding a phone up for hours.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ku2fbtdqn3a44ENUri6gyT" name="xreal-one-vs-xreal-air-2-side" alt="Xreal Air 2 (left) vs Xreal One (right) from a side perspective" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku2fbtdqn3a44ENUri6gyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also think the company struggled to differentiate these glasses from existing products. It's possible that they were sleeker than existing smart display glasses, but is that enough, especially given that a Mac was a requirement for use? Probably not.</p><p>Even many of Apple's described glasses features sounded similar to existing Xreal One and Viture Pro glasses. They reportedly didn't have the EyeSight feature from Vision Pro — that's the outer display that shows your eyes to people in the room — but the glasses were said to have an electrochromic film on the glasses that could change the tint to show your actual eyes or cover them up to let others around you know that you're busy.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Apple likely struggled to differentiate this product from the pack without significant technological hurdles.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The question is why Apple didn't feel content with shipping a high-quality wearable display, which is how current smart display glasses could be described. The Xreal One glasses I'm wearing right now are the first pair Xreal has shipped with custom silicon inside, but even still, the company isn't trying to sell these as competition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons to wear an Apple Vision Pro is to have a studio-quality set of virtual monitors no matter where you're working from, and I'm genuinely surprised Apple didn't try to just replicate this one proven feature in a smart glasses form factor.</p><p>Without Apple coming forward and saying it, I think the glasses didn't deliver a wide enough field of view (FoV) to properly replicate the Vision Pro's virtual monitor experience. Xreal One currently sports the widest FoV of any smart display glasses at 50 degrees. Xreal One Pro ups this to 57 degrees and is slated to launch soon. Both of these are notably wider than the closest competition but still fall short of Meta Orion's 70-degree FoV and Vision Pro's 90 degrees.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Existing smart display glasses have become increasingly excellent, and it's surprising Apple didn't at least go for the "premium wearable display" angle.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>What's particularly interesting to me here is that Apple was apparently trying to run Vision OS on these glasses. If they required a Mac to function, I'm not entirely sure what Apple was trying to do by including a full-fledged OS on a pair of tethered glasses.</p><p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> operating system is being used to power headsets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung Project Moohan,</a> as well as smart glasses from Xreal, Magic Leap, and potentially other companies. That means both Vision OS and Android XR are capable of being scaled to very different types of products, but neither company has shown off exactly what this means.</p><p>Apple absolutely should try to at least ship a pair of glasses that function as a wearable display, if for no other reason than to save its users' necks while they travel or are away from their desks. Until then, pick up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4">Viture Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Renowned-Adjustable-Transparency/dp/B0DNFFXG65/">Xreal One</a> glasses from Amazon. Your neck will thank you.</p>

<hr>
<p>A tech-savvy user pulled off something pretty wild—they got Grand Theft Auto and God of War running on a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5.</p><p>A Redditor named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1i2b8l5/this_is_just_a_regular_smartwatch_no/" target="_blank">ZenonDesingk</a> managed to get God of War, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and even Forza Horizon 4 (streamed through Steam Link) running on their Galaxy Watch 5. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/this-redditor-installed-a-psp-emulator-on-a-galaxy-watch-5-now-it-runs-gta-at-60fps-and-god-of-war" target="_blank">TechRadar</a> spotted the post and decided to dive into the subreddit to figure out how they made it happen.</p><p>ZenonDesingk shared that they bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> after being impressed by a friend’s device. But when they checked out the available games, they were pretty let down. Still, the user didn’t give up. That open-ended flexibility became their driving force to push the watch’s limits.</p><p>However, when the usual methods of sideloading APKs—like Bluetooth or browser installs—didn’t work, ZenonDesingk had to step up. They turned to ADB and the Bugjaeger app, using Wi-Fi to transfer the needed APK files from their phone to the smartwatch.</p><p>Once the PSP emulator was installed and the DPI settings were fine-tuned, they brought some serious gaming action to the Galaxy Watch 5. Classics like GTA, Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed: Most Wanted ran buttery smooth at around 60 FPS, while heavier titles like God of War still managed a solid 30 FPS.</p>

<p>Even though the Galaxy Watch 5 is a three-year-old device and not exactly the latest tech, it’s still holding its own—running emulated PSP games at a smooth 60 FPS. It’s a solid reminder of how capable its hardware still is, even by today’s standards.</p><p>Knowing touchscreen controls could only go so far, ZenonDesingk hooked up a Bluetooth gamepad to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, making gameplay way more comfortable and accurate. With that hurdle out of the way, the only real limit left was the watch’s performance. And thanks to a bunch of emulators and the option to sideload Android games, the little smartwatch suddenly became a surprisingly versatile gaming machine.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung might finally let you take charge of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>'s annoying screen dimming feature that kicks in when it hits 5% battery. Word is, the upcoming One UI 7 update could give you the option to turn it off.</p><p>Currently, One UI goes full-on power-saving mode when your battery hits 5%, slashing your screen brightness to the point where it’s almost impossible to see, even in decent lighting.</p><p>Sure, dialing down screen brightness can help squeeze more juice out of your battery, but it really should be up to you, not your phone. Right now, Galaxy devices take matters into their own hands, automatically dimming the screen when the battery is running on fumes. Sure, you can crank the brightness back up, but having your phone override your settings like that is super annoying.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-7-auto-dim-screen-low-battery-feature/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the new One UI 7 beta address this annoyance. This means you're getting the choice to stop your screen from going dim when your battery hits 5%.</p><p>In the Battery settings, there’s a fresh toggle called "Auto dim screen" that lets you turn off the automatic brightness drop.</p>

<p>This update might seem like a small change, but it’s actually pretty meaningful. For starters, it’s all about giving users more control over how their phone works. Letting people customize their device’s behavior is a win, and Samsung deserves some credit for finally giving Galaxy owners the option to ditch that auto-dimming hassle.</p><p>Sure, automatically dimming the screen to save battery makes sense, but it can also make your phone way harder to use when you need it most. Letting users decide how to handle that trade-off is a smart move.</p><p>One UI 7 is officially out for the Galaxy S25 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">in beta for the S24 series</a>.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Zuckerberg’s had enough of leaks at Meta and sent a memo warning that leaking info could get employees fired, but of course, the memo itself leaked almost right away.</li><li>Meta's CEO is cutting back on transparency in meetings after leaks made it clear that too much info was slipping out.</li><li>To stop leaks, Meta’s ditching the old Q&A style for a poll system, where employees vote on the questions they care about most.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is fed up with Meta employees spilling the tea from internal meetings. The company sent out a memo warning that leaking info could cost them their job. But, in a classic twist, the memo itself got leaked almost immediately.</p><p>Meta’s CISO, Guy Rosen, sent out a memo doubling down on the company’s no-leak policy. The message was clear: if you’re caught sharing internal info, you could face serious consequences—like getting fired.</p><p>To address this concern, Zuckerberg is dialing back on transparency in company-wide meetings after too many leaks. In an audio clip snagged by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-says-everything-i-say-leaks-in-leaked-meeting-audio/" target="_blank">404 Media</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fortune.com/2025/01/31/meta-fire-staff-for-leaks-zuckerberg-updates-memo/" target="_blank">Fortune</a>), he said, “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks."</p><p>At Meta’s latest meeting, Mark Zuckerberg cited some pretty controversial updates. He talked about cutting back on DEI programs, tweaking hate speech rules (including ones around sexual orientation), and how the company plans to use performance metrics to decide who might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-social-media-reality-labs-layoffs-2024">get hit with layoffs</a>.</p><p>Rosen stressed that when company data gets leaked or stolen, the fallout isn’t just about the immediate security risks—it goes way beyond that.</p><p>"Our teams become demoralized, and we all waste time that is better spent working on our products and toward our goals and mission," he said.</p><p>To crack down on leaks, Meta is ditching the old Q&A style for a voting system. The company is switching to a “poll” system where employees can submit questions ahead of time and vote on them. That way, the discussions focus on the topics everyone actually cares about—and hopefully, fewer details end up spilling out.</p><p>Meta used to let employees throw questions into the open during Q&A sessions, with upvotes deciding which ones got the spotlight. But this year, things changed—the vote counts were hidden, and commenting got shut down, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/603754/mark-zuckerberg-tells-employees-to-buckle-up-in-leaked-all-hands-meeting" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Big companies with tons of employees are basically leak magnets—it’s almost inevitable that some sensitive info or internal drama will slip out. The bigger the team, the harder it is to keep everything under wraps.</p>

<p><em><strong>Several people have written in complaining about Music Player - MP3 Player from Red Sky Labs (formerly known as Muzio Player). None of them had anything good to say.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It seems that the app went with a freemium subscription model, showing ads unless a user pays a monthly fee. That's fine, but when Red Sky Labs did this, they cancelled the premium plan of  users who had previously paid for an ad-free experience.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Play Store reviews confirm this, so I'm naming the company to warn you to consider its past behavior before you give it any money.</strong></em></p>
<p>I hate to hear about this sort of thing, but it's more common than you think. I've been bitten by the very same bug with another app that went free with a subscription after I gave them $5.99 for extra content. You can guess what happened when the app updated. There is a very good chance something similar has happened to you, too.</p><p>Why? Are mobile app stores filled with dishonest people trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">scam a couple of bucks</a> at a time until they've built a fortune? Not really, though those people certainly exist; it's just too easy to get away with it, so app publishers may simply not care.</p>
<p>Here's the rub — it's not legal to do what Red Sky Labs did with its music player. It's also against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google/developer-content-policy/" rel="nofollow">Google's Play Store rules</a>. And neither of those things matters because of the small amount of money involved. If you pay for a lifetime service, it is expected to last the lifetime of one of the parties. If you change your business model, you need to make accommodations for people who have already paid.</p><p>Good luck getting anyone to care about it and help you get your five bucks back because it's <em>only</em> five bucks. You're not taking some developer to small claims court over five bucks. No lawyer will take that as a case because it's only five bucks. It's your five bucks, and if you're like me, you feel willing to fight through Mordor to get it back, but nobody else cares about your five bucks.</p>

<p>Google and Apple <em>should</em> care, and on some level, they do. But they each have bigger things to worry about. With millions of apps moving through mobile stores the majority of time and effort is spent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">making sure they are safe</a> and they handle the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/problem-android-permissions-too-much-information-and-not-enough-information-all-once">intricate permissions</a> correctly. And that's surely hard to manage, so I'm not surprised that reports about this to Google go mostly unanswered. <strong>Do not let this stop you from reporting the offending app.</strong></p>
<p>Also, if you're so inclined, don't forget about posting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/thanks-reddit-you-can-now-block-youtube-ads-without-going-through-any-hoops">Reddit</a> and other social media so other people can read and pile on. Attention is how you rectify this kind of problem. If enough people complain, Google or Apple must act, and the app publisher may even find a way to fix the problem so they aren't forced to give a bunch of people five bucks in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-redeem-google-play-points-movies-shows-and-apps-google-tv">app store credit</a>.</p><p>Finally, send detailed reports about what's happening to every tech website you regularly visit. When I see several people saying the same thing, I look into it. If it's something other people need to hear — like an app publisher bringing back the ads and keeping the five bucks — I'll write about it.</p><p>This app has over 100 million downloads at Google Play. People need to know more about the company before it gets another 100 million.</p>

<ul><li>New trademarks in the UK and New Zealand hint that Samsung’s mixed reality headset might be called “Beyond.”</li><li>The New Zealand trademark application lists products like VR, AR, and XR headsets, potentially linking “Beyond” to Samsung’s upcoming device.</li><li>However, BigScreenVR already holds a trademark for "Beyond," though its registration details are unclear.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New trademarks in the UK and New Zealand are pointing to Samsung’s mixed reality headset being called “Beyond.”</p><p>Back in December, Samsung and Google gave us a preview of their joint XR headset project, known internally as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>. They shared a few images and teased some possible features for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> platform, giving us a taste of what’s to come.</p><p>At last month’s Samsung Unpacked 2025 event, the much-hyped XR headset got a quick, low-key showcase. Even though it’s been over a month since the teaser, we’re still in the dark about what the device will actually be called.</p><p>As spotted by Brad Lynch, new trademark applications in the UK and New Zealand might have spilled the beans on what Samsung’s upcoming mixed-reality headset will be called (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xrdailynews.com/samsung-mr-headset-may-launch-as-galaxy-beyond/" target="_blank">XR Daily News</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung’s recently unveiled Mixed Reality Headset may be called the “Samsung Beyond” or “Galaxy Beyond”This is based on trademarks filed in the UK and New Zealand last monthThanks @LaidBackDev_ for the heads up! pic.twitter.com/C3qShVxURr<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1885206610412249524">January 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The filings suggest the device could roll out as either "Samsung Beyond."</p><p>The New Zealand trademark application covers a wide variety of products, from TVs and smart glasses to digital door locks. But what really stands out is the mention of VR, AR, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">XR headsets</a>, hinting that this could be tied to the highly anticipated device.</p><p>If the trademark gets the green light, "Beyond" is likely to become the name for Samsung’s upcoming headset.</p><p>That said, BigScreenVR already has a headset called "Beyond" and was quick to chime in on Lynch’s tweet, saying they hold the trademark for the name. But here’s the catch—details about where and how their trademark is registered are still up in the air.</p><p>Project Moohan is still in the prototype stage, so details like the release date and price for Samsung’s XR headset are a mystery for now. That said, whispers are floating around that it could cost at least half as much as Apple’s Vision Pro.</p><p>In his YouTube video, Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) highlighted that the headset ditches the over-the-head strap, opting for a single adjustable strap at the back, much like the Meta Quest Pro. Brownlee mentioned that this setup, paired with the distinct facial interface, makes it feel pretty comfortable without needing the extra strap—unlike the Vision Pro, which doesn’t quite pull it off.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims that Samsung could name its first tri-fold the "Galaxy G Fold" with new "display and film" hardware applied to it.</li><li>Rumors once again suggest a 10-inch display and a "slightly thicker" build compared to Huawei's Mate XT.</li><li>Samsung teased a tri-fold during its Unpacked reveal, but rumors are split between a late 2025 or "early" 2026 launch for it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New rumors are coming to light about Samsung's recently teased tri-fold device during an Unpacked segment.</p><p>Murmurs about Samsung's tri-fold were posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/yeux1122/223743092951">Naver by Lanzuk</a>, who claims the device will be called the "Galaxy G Fold" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/samsung-tri-fold-galaxy-g-fold-report/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster goes into some purported specs, stating the phone will feature a "newly developed display and film" specifically for it. Apparently, these new pieces of hardware haven't been applied to the company's typical book-style device, the Z Fold.</p><p>Other alleged specifications include the device's 10-inch display when unfolded fully and a height of 6.54 inches.</p><p>Speaking of the phone's purported build, rumors claim Samsung's tri-fold, which will likely go up against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei's Mate XT</a>, weighs "the same" as the Chinese device, but is also "slightly thicker."</p><p>For its folding method, the tipster states Samsung's version will "fold/unfold on both sides."</p><p>Its launch details are still being speculated; however, current rumors pin its launch either "later this year" or "early 2026." Later in 2025 could push us past Samsung's usual summer Unpacked and into the fall. But, we'll have to wait and see how the company plays this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yocDkSssKZahVRHh532ZJY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-10.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yocDkSssKZahVRHh532ZJY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some aspects of the current rumors that we're hearing consistently now, like the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored">a "G-shaped" fold style</a>. It was reported earlier in January that Samsung could deploy this unique folding shape for the device to improve its display's durability. The folding style shake-up could involve an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-phone-development-rumor">inward</a>" mechanic, as well. To elaborate, the report claims the device will have an "in-folding method that folds the inside of the screen inward twice."</p><p>Moreover, there were rumors that the new display tech the "G Fold" could have is something new from Samsung Display. That side of the Korean OEM is supposedly preparing to debut this new screen tech, which <em>could </em>happen during MWC 2025.</p><p>The idea of a Samsung tri-fold has become even more real after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">teased the device</a> during Unpacked. In a long line of devices in-development, one silhouette, for a tri-fold, was spotted. A phone like this from Samsung has been rumored/thought about for years now — which was magnified by Huawei's surprise entry. Samsung didn't go into specifics about the phone during Unpacked.</p><p>However, rumors claim the company could begin producing the phone in preparation for launch in Q2 2025. So, perhaps these "late 2025" expectations could be met. Either way, let's not hold our breath. Things can always change.</p>

<ul><li>Google just made the Pixel Weather app way better by letting you easily switch between measurement units.</li><li>The new update adds a dedicated page where you can set units for rain, wind, pressure, and visibility.</li><li>Before, changing units meant messing with your phone’s language or region settings, which affected way more than just the app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has finally given the Pixel Weather app a nice little upgrade, making it super easy to switch between different measurement units.</p><p>Since launching in August 2024 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-new-weather-app-for-the-pixel-9-is-showing-up-early">revamped Pixel Weather app has been a hit</a>, thanks to its fresh design and smart weather summaries. But it hasn’t been all sunshine—users have been a bit frustrated with how clunky it is to tweak measurement units for things like rain and wind speed.</p><p>While temperature unit conversion has been around for a while, other metrics were left out. Now, Google seems to be fixing that.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-weather-app-measurements-units-apk-teardown-3506241/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is rolling out Pixel Weather version 1.0.20250106.720365328.release, and it’s bringing a dedicated "Weather units" page. This update lets you pick your preferred units for stuff like rain, wind speed, pressure, and visibility—finally breaking free from the old system where these settings were stuck to your phone’s language.</p><p>Before, tweaking measurement units in the Pixel Weather app was a bit of a headache—you had to mess with your system language or regional settings, which affected way more than just the app.</p><p>Now, you can pick your favorite units for each metric by heading to <em>Profile icon</em> > <em>Pixel Weather settings</em> > <em>Weather units</em>. And if you’re tweaking temperature units, the "Temperature" page is still your go-to spot.</p>

<p>The Pixel Weather app keeps it simple and clean, and gives you all the weather basics at a glance. With its user-friendly layout, you can check the current temperature, upcoming forecasts, and extra details like humidity and wind speed without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The big win with the new Pixel Weather update is that you finally get full control over your measurement units, so you don't have to worry about messing up other apps—just set it up how you like it. The update is hitting the Play Store now for supported Pixel devices.</p>

<ul><li>Code found in the Pixel Watch Management Service system app shows a reference to "Adaptive charging."</li><li>Pixel phones currently learn from your charging habits to determine when to limit charging to 80% to protect battery life.</li><li>Wear OS watches currently have no way to stop charging before 100% power, though some can send a push notification to your phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has spent the last year hyper-focused on improving Android smartwatches' battery life, particularly its own Pixel Watch 3. Now, based on an APK teardown of Pixel Watch system software, it appears the next battery-preserving feature will be adaptive charging, ported over from Pixel phones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-adaptive-charging-apk-3522565/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> posted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-adaptive-charging-apk-3522565/">APK teardown</a> on Monday showing the following string of code:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-html" language="html" ><code><uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.wearable.pixel.pdms.permission.ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_SERVICE"/></code></pre>
<p>While the site didn't find any additional info, it's a fair assumption that the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-adaptive-charge-silent-updates">Pixel Adaptive Charging</a> feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and other Google phones will port to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> in a highly similar form — if not other Android watches.</p><p>On Pixel phones, if you turn on Charging optimization, the Android software will "learn" from your charging habits for two weeks; then, whenever you plug your phone in at night, it will shut off charging at 80% and only bring it to 100% at the point that you typically unplug it in the morning.</p><p>You can also manually limit charging to 80% on Pixel phones, so we're curious if that'll be another option for Pixel Watches, in addition to adaptive charging. Given that the Pixel Watch 3 lasts at least 24 hours with AOD enabled — and can last up to 48 hours with lighter use — it should last you a full day even if you put it on at 80% power.</p><p>Depending on its size, the Pixel Watch 3 takes about 35 or 50 minutes to hit 80%, and 60 or 80 minutes to hit 100%. The slower charging past 80% is already a built-in form of adaptive charging. Still, once your watch hits 100%, your battery capacity <em>will</em> steadily decrease over time, which is why Google enabled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-fully-charged-notifications-are-finally-rolling-out-widely">full-charge notifications last year</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.30%;"><img id="4VWzwYM3b2xvaPNLUwKzM3" name="Pixel-Watch-3-developer-mode" alt="Developer options on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VWzwYM3b2xvaPNLUwKzM3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2259" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, this hidden code suggests Pixel Watch owners who don't wear their watch overnight will have the option to enable adaptive charging and preserve that capacity as much as possible, while still having their watch fully topped off in the morning.</p><p>Since it's a "permission" feature, Adaptive Charging should be off by default until you enable it; we know that some users will prefer their watch to hit 100% as fast as possible.</p><p>We know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> should arrive this fall on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, presumably with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">new Gemini assistant</a>. But it's fair to assume that this adaptive charging feature will come to current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> models much sooner than that, and will hopefully be available on Galaxy and OnePlus Watches, too (eventually).</p><p>Even though Google has successfully extended battery life on its newer models, the Pixel Watch series remains comparatively short-lived when you look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-for-battery-life">best smartwatches for long battery life</a>. It needs all the help it can get to keep what capacity it has!</p>

<p>Google has reportedly started adding the missing pieces for its long-awaited encrypted messaging with emergency services.</p><p>During an APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-prepares-rcs-based-text-to-911-apk-teardown-3522456/">Android Authority</a>, several new strings of code were added to Google Messages about 911 RCS texting support. It seems the company is beginning to add the necessary pieces for proper functionality, like "location_permission." Granting access to your device's location will likely be a requirement if you're interested in texting emergency services in the event of a problem.</p><p>There is another string, "enable_emergency_action," which seems to concern the users sent message when contacting 911.</p><p>Furthermore, there's a larger, overall section of code added: "enable_emergency_rcs-messaging."</p><p>The publication adds that the new code was discovered in the latest Google Messages update, version 20250129. While it's stated that this beta "enables" RCS texting with 911, there's not much else to surface. What this could look like (officially) on-device wasn't detailed, nor anything else of notable interest.</p><p>Perhaps we're coming up on its widespread Android rollout, considering Google said as much last summer.</p>

<p>In June 2024, Google announced that it was bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-announces-911-rcs-texting-to-android">RCS texting services with 911</a>. It  was stated that support would let users send high-quality images and videos to first responders to help them understand "your situation." Users can also see when the authorities are actively responding to your request for aid. More importantly, Google's partnership with RapidSOS brings the location-sharing side of this feature.</p><p>Data from the FCC showed that roughly 53% of the emergency centers in the U.S. support text messages as a viable form of communication. Through this 911 RCS support, Google seeks to bring it to every call center/agency across the country for free.</p><p>The company said in its June announcement that it planned to roll this out to Android users "this winter." We have crossed into February already, so hopefully these newfound Google Message strings indicate its approaching release.</p><p>Earlier this month, Google made good on another feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-more-users-regions-stable">dual SIM RCS support</a>. More users in the U.S., Canada, and Germany on the Pixel 9 and a few Galaxy devices started noticing the update arrive. The feature seemingly arrived for those on Verizon, AT&T, and USMobile plans. The patch brings additional settings, which let users choose to activate RCS for both SIMs or for whichever you'd prefer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Huawei patented a 3D fingerprint sensor for its smartwatches for both biometric ID and gesture controls.</li><li>The patent suggests you'd be able to twist your finger (counter-)clockwise to adjust watch settings like volume and brightness.</li><li>Smartwatches would also recognize multiple fingerprints in order to register different actions to specific fingers.</li><li>Samsung and Apple previously patented smartwatch fingerprint sensors in 2018 and 2022, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Smartwatches with contactless payments universally rely on clunky PIN systems for security. We've seen Galaxy and Apple Watch patents for in-display fingerprint sensors or Touch ID built into a button, but neither smartwatch brand has brought the idea to actual products. Now Huawei has an even more intriguing fingerprint smartwatch patent, tantalizing us with a feature we may never see for ourselves.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/huawei-multi-functional-3d-fingerprint-sensor-patent-details/" target="_blank">MySmartPrice</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/news/huawei-hidden-smartwatch-fingerprint-sensor-patent" target="_blank">Wareable</a>), Huawei's patent describes a three-dimensional "advanced optical fingerprint sensor" built into the AMOLED smartwatch display that can recognize your fingerprint at any angle.</p><p>Huawei's patented idea is to let you register multiple fingerprints, then attribute specific actions to each finger; in one figure, tapping a message with your thumb, index, or middle finger triggers three different responses, including calling the messenger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="u4yBWa33a3gRMnvdLYXxY" name="huawei-fingerprint-patent" alt="A patent figure showing a generic smartwatch and a hand with a pointing index finger at various angles, showing the watch owner pressing their finger on the display and twisting it in different directions to trigger specific actions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4yBWa33a3gRMnvdLYXxY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="820" height="461" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In another patent image, it shows the smartwatch owner twisting their index finger to "control volume and display brightness through gestures," with the direction of the twist — clockwise or counterclockwise — deciding whether the volume goes up or down.</p><p>Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> and Apple Watches can recognize gestures like finger pinches for shortcuts, but long-pressing or twisting specific fingers on a screen might feel more exact and natural to some users. Recognizing multiple fingerprints would also let you set multiple favorite apps or actions.</p><p>Plus, of course, you'd finally have the option to use a payment app without needing to hen-and-peck a PIN number on a tiny watch screen, or worry about someone else guessing your PIN. Instead, the Huawei watch would prompt you for your fingerprint after you trigger Google Wallet (or Huawei Pay, in this case).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1289px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.23%;"><img id="qvAmpNktVgBFg4wiUaimbD" name="Apple-Watch-fingerprint-touch-id-patent" alt="A patent figure showing an Apple Watch, with arrows pointing to the back button to indicate where a Touch ID fingerprint sensor might be placed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvAmpNktVgBFg4wiUaimbD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1289" height="815" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.patentlymobile.com/2018/11/samsung-patent-illustrates-continued-work-on-under-display-fingerprint-scanning-for-future-smartphones-and-galaxy-watch.html">patented</a> the idea of an under-display fingerprint sensor in 2018, but the patent itself was quite vague, also suggesting the idea that their watches might have an under-display camera for an "iris scanner" to authenticate the wearer. Neither ever came to pass, and it seems unlikely Samsung has any current plans for fingerprint tech, no matter how useful it might be in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>Apple's 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/patent-reveals-apple-watch-touch-id-not-where-we-expected">Touch ID patent</a> felt much more thought out, with a sensor built into the Side button that could authenticate the user or approve a transaction. But despite how useful this sounded, nothing has come of it, nor of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/touch-id-might-be-coming-apple-watch">previous report</a> in 2022 claiming Apple wanted to stick the fingerprint sensor in the Apple Watch S7 crown.</p><p>So while Huawei's patent sounds intriguing, it's a bit bittersweet to consider the Chinese smartwatch brand potentially being the first to implement it in its watches, considering you rarely see Huawei products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/huawei-sets-sights-squarely-on-samsung-with-watch-gt-5-series">Huawei GT 5 Pro</a> sold outside of Asia. A large portion of smartwatch power users who depend on contactless payments will have to keep tapping in a PIN code for the foreseeable future, with no better alternative.</p><p>Of course, Huawei might very well never use this fingerprint sensor idea, either! The brand may decide that embedding a complex 3D fingerprint sensor may be more trouble than it's worth, due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/researchers-detail-bruteprint-attack-android-fingerprint-sensors">security issues</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-fingerprint-problems-continue">fingerprint recognition problems</a> we've seen on Android phones over the years.</p>

<ul><li>Drivers with the TomTom GO app on Android Auto have taken to its Play Store review page to report issues.</li><li>Users state they are receiving error messages and a completely sour experience, which could've been caused by a new Android Auto update.</li><li>While the devs work on a fix, Android Auto suffered audio stuttering and error messages late last year, as well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Drivers are encountering an issue with a navigational app for cars and trucks with Google's in-car software.</p><p>Users have reportedly taken <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomtom.gplay.navapp&hl=en&pli=1">to the Play Store</a> to report issues with the TomTom GO app on Android Auto (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/android-auto-tomtom-go-app-issues/">9to5Google</a>). Many of the most recent reviews on the store in February voice display issues and permission problems with the navigational tool. One user with a review on February 2 states, "Disappointing as the app does not want to display on Android Auto in car."</p><p>A day later, another user piggybacked off a previous review, adding that their granted permissions are "not recognized" by TomTom GO in a 2024 Toyota Yaris Cross. They state that, even after re-applying the permissions, the same error message appears, forcing them to repeat the process.</p><p>Strangely, the problems have seemingly started in January — most notably, toward the end of the month.</p><p>There are a host of TomTom GO app reviews between January 29 and 30, where users state the program no longer works with Android Auto. Users are encountering GPS problems but, more importantly, they state the issue occurred <em>after </em>the recent Android Auto software update.</p><p>It's unclear whether the issue is connected (though it seems likely). The support team behind TomTom GO is aware of the problem and is actively working to fix it. A TomTom International BV representative responded to one user report stating, "We are sorry to hear about the problem and we are aware of this issue - Our developers are actively working on it. As soon we have any updates we will let you know via release notes."</p>

<p>Among the many navigational apps, TomTom Go sought to separate itself with car <em>and </em>truck features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tomtom-go-nav-trucker-routes">that arrived a while back</a>. The company released a "truck plan" for drivers of larger vehicles so they can plan routes "differently from others." The addition was seen as positive, considering vehicle size (think sixteen-wheelers) and weight can't go everywhere other cars can. The update lets truck drivers see traffic, truck parking, height restrictions, and more.</p><p>Android Auto encountered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-rolls-out-bug-fixes-for-error-messages">some issues late last year</a> (Dec 24), involving stuttering audio and error messages. Users were encouraged to remain on v13.3 of the OS after the problem surfaced. Playing music or listening to information from Google Maps gave users stuttering audio issues while error messages hit users with a Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>To begin January, Google pushed Android Auto <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-rolls-into-the-polestar-2-to-cover-some-gaps-in-android-automotive">onto the Polestar 2</a>, bringing with it an HD Radio, seamless phone connecting, and a brand new media player.</p>

Sure, there are some exceptions, such as Balatro, Monument Valley, or Pokemon TCGP.</p><p>However, most of my mobile gaming is done via emulation, such as relaxing with Pokemon Pinball or firing up whatever Switch game tickles my fancy at the time. During those times that I wanted to play PC games, I either grabbed one of my x86 handhelds, actually sat at my desktop, or relied on a combination of Moonlight or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">NVIDIA GeForce Now</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-1.jpg" alt="Fallout 4 running on the Ayaneo Pocket S with the Steam Deck OLED" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3940" height="2216" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That might not be the case for very much longer, as many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> can actually be used to play games designed for computers. Much of this is made possible by Winlator, an app that basically lets you run x86_64 games right on your Android phone or tablet.</p><p>When Winlator first landed on GitHub <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator/releases/tag/v1.0.0">back in 2023</a>, there was little fanfare simply because it was still far too limited in what was possible. For instance, the biggest limitation is that you can only play DRM-free games. These games are most commonly found on GOG, but there are some that might already be found in your Steam library.</p><p>Since its release, Winlator has exploded in popularity, at least in the emulation scene. But the biggest hurdle for adoption has been the actual setup process of getting your games installed and running.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xm6fHHiGHyoYwS8xWcpRNX" name="winlator-odin-2-balatro-legion-go-s" alt="Winlator installing game on AYN Odin 2 and Balatro on Legion Go S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xm6fHHiGHyoYwS8xWcpRNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not as simple as dragging and dropping files and then tapping a button, as there are quite a few different settings to change. Not to mention that just because you find the right configuration for what game, doesn't mean that the same settings will work for another.</p><p>I bring up Winlator specifically because there are countless forks and alternative versions, some aiming to provide better performance, while others attempt to make it possible to download compatible games from Steam. And over the past couple of weeks, there are three new apps that make it possible to play Windows games on Android.</p><p>The first of which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5125193439382355">Winplay Engine from Xiaomi</a>, letting you download and install games from Steam onto your device. Unfortunately, this is still in beta and is currently only available if you own the Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro. Since I don't have the Pad 6S Pro, I haven't been able to take Winplay for a spin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CUufF4F7z4B7gX47VMJkTX" name="pluvia-on-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Pluvia app for Windows emulation on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CUufF4F7z4B7gX47VMJkTX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/oxters168/Pluvia">Pluvia </a>was the next app on the list but is a bit different as it's designed to specifically let you play DRM-free games from your personal Steam library. While I was able to get it installed and running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, the results have been <em>very</em> hit-or-miss.</p><p>Even lightweight titles such as Pizza Tower or Stardew Valley don't seem to work. Meanwhile, games like UFO 50, Super Meat Boy, and Undertale work <em>mostly</em> fine, with the occasional audio issues or random slowdowns.</p><p>Then we have an app that I've been kind of keeping an eye on from afar, as I first heard about it late last year. GameSir makes many of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile controllers</a>, but the company is also apparently kind of getting into the emulation scene.</p><p>It's doing so with the release of the GameHub app, which is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">only available to download directly</a>. However, GameHub stands out from the pack in a few different ways, and not just for allowing you to play Windows games on Android. It also lets you stream games from other platforms, such as your PC, Xbox, or PlayStation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozntGWzhmbrJDgm4zJu8TX" name="gamesir-gamehub-home-screen" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozntGWzhmbrJDgm4zJu8TX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More importantly, GameHub is basically a fancy wrapper for Winlator, taking a lot of the potential frustration out of trying to play Windows games on Android. Instead of tinkering with menus that are clearly from Windows 98, GameHub puts everything in a modern interface.</p><p>And if you install the GameHub app for your Windows desktop PC, you can sync your Steam library and stream games to your device. However, there's also a "Game Assistant" feature that lets you import games from your computer to your phone, making it possible to play certain titles locally.</p><p>I'm still putting GameHub through its paces, but I have been able to get a few games to load. I can't tell you how awesome it is to be able to play the original Star Wars Battlefront II on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> should be the most powerful chip to date, I'm going to also try and install some heavier titles just to see what happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vnqGhoadne2MgfqhH7bwSX" name="rog-ally-x-legion-go-s-odin-2-pocket-dmg-gaming" alt="Ayaneo Pocket DMG emulating Switch, Odin 2 with Winlator, Balatro on Legion Go S, and Bazzite on ROG Ally X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnqGhoadne2MgfqhH7bwSX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even with apps like GameHub providing a solution that is far easier to navigate than Winlator, I don't expect x86 game emulation on Android to even come close to the retro gaming scene. There's <em>a lot</em> of trial and error, and even installing just one game can take forever.</p><p>Even still, it's simply incredible that it's even possible to get ANY x86 game installed on a mobile phone. Let alone with stable frame rates and without immediately crashing.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube has new experimental features for its Premium tier users.</li><li>The prominent ones include the ability to watch a YouTube video at 4x speed.</li><li>Jump ahead is another nifty feature in the works, which should help users jump to their favorite content faster.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube has great perks for users who subscribe to its Premium tier subscription. Users can avoid ads, use YouTube Music, and much more. Other than the already available ones, the company allows users to test some new upcoming or experimental features, and the video streaming platform already has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">bunch of them</a>.</p><p>YouTube currently allows users to watch content at speeds ranging from 0.25x, 0.5x to 1.75x and 2x. It adds convenience to users who want to finish the video soon or take it slow per their requirements and it is especially beneficial when listening to podcasts, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:790px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.24%;"><img id="D7ieRoknMLXSCeikYJz8Sf" name="youtube-playback-speed-4x" alt="YouTube 4x playback speed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D7ieRoknMLXSCeikYJz8Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="790" height="468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the streaming giant’s latest experimental feature now allows users to adjust speeds for up to 4x. The fine-tuning of speeds is currently available for mobile handsets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iOS devices, and not on the web just yet.</p><p>Needless to say, the experimental feature is only for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-canceled-spotify-and-used-youtube-music">YouTube Premium </a>users. It is still unclear how exactly the 4x speeds would be useful while watching a video, and the only reason we think of is perhaps to finish the video or skip to the preferred part 2x faster than the currently available speeds. The aforementioned mobile handset users can use this experimental feature until February 26.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:790px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="9vvCQFHt6NUe8cjXDuHc7g" name="youtube-jump-ahead-feature" alt="YouTube Jump Ahead" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9vvCQFHt6NUe8cjXDuHc7g.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="790" height="444" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to skipping content, Jump Ahead is another interesting experimental feature that “enables viewers to get to the content they care about faster.” It is a new floating button to get to your favorite content even faster and is now available on the web. However, the clock’s already ticking on this feature because the ability to experiment with this feature for YouTube Premium users is ending on February 5.</p><p>The other notable experimental features that are available include a high-quality audio feature, which lets users listen to the best quality audio for the eligible music videos on the platform. The high-quality audio here translates to 256kbps (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603581/youtube-premium-experimental-test-4x-speed-now-available">The Verge</a>) and is available for users on iOS and Android until February 22.</p>
<p>Further, iOS users can experience YouTube Shorts video in picture-in-picture mode when switching between apps just like regular YouTube video – and it is for YouTube Premium users only. Similarly, again on iOS, users can enable “Smart downloads” for YouTube Shorts, which allows them to automatically download shorts for offline viewing.</p><p>All mentioned experimental features for YouTube Premium users will perhaps add a better viewing experience than the service already offered at the moment. It still needs to be determined which of these will roll out officially in the coming weeks or months.</p>

<p>Samsung’s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">Galaxy S25 </a>series is set to reach the people who have preordered in the coming week. Meanwhile, we got information about the next Galaxy phones — thanks to a couple of tipsters on X.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is likely to debut in some time in Q3 this year, a tipster Anthony (@TheGalox_) has shared some interesting information on the foldable handset. It is believed to be on the lines of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a> foldable phone.</p>

<p>Samsung has a Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition handset for the Korean market other than the regular Galaxy Z Fold 6. For the uninformed, the former has bigger displays and is lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The primary camera on the Z Fold Editor is also a new 200MP sensor.</p><p>According to the tipster, these features are expected on the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7. Additionally, users can expect a bigger vapor chamber, a faster chip, and better speakers than the special edition handset.</p><p>The bigger vapor chamber integration has been witnessed on the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> of Samsung, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.

<p>Ever since I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">first-gen Shokz OpenFits</a> in 2023, I've worn them for hundreds of runs, walks, and hikes, no exaggeration. My ear canals have had an unprecedented break from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a> jammed into them, saving me from buds falling out during hard runs (which causes the sound to get worse), impacted ear wax, and the artificial hissing of transparency modes.</p><p>But using them for over a year made me well aware of the OpenFit's many flaws, from an obnoxious charging issue to finicky touch controls and average sound quality. So, I'm thrilled that the Shokz OpenFit 2 immediately fixed or improved on almost all of my complaints.</p><p>Shokz is best known for its bone conduction headphones, and I'm no audiophile to judge how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2</a> sound quality compares to the OpenFit 2's air conduction. All I know is that I prefer the latter's "natural" sound while still giving me (mostly) unimpeded situational awareness during runs and races. And now, I'm much more likely to use the OpenFit 2's multipoint pairing and wear them in non-fitness contexts.</p>


<h2 id="more-comfortable-than-ever-2">More comfortable than ever</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-worn" alt="A photo of the reviewer wearing the Shokz OpenFit 2, with its ear hook looped next to his glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My appreciation for the original OpenFit was how its ear hook placed the speaker directly over my ears without impeding them; I could safely hear approaching cyclists or "on your left" runners and even the sounds of nature if listening to quieter content like audiobooks. They've never once fallen off. I forget they're there aside from light pressure on the back and side of my ear, and the audio quality was good enough.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 retains the same concept and target audience (athletes) but with minor tweaks that began with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review">Shokz OpenFit Air</a> — which were more comfortable but too budget-focused to be "better" than the originals.</p><p>The OpenFit 2 has a thinner outer hook that rounds into a softer, wider silicone edge than the original model. It's hard to describe the difference between the two, but the OpenFit 2 somehow sits more naturally in its over-ear position, while the original OpenFit feels as if it's pressing harder against my skin to stay in place. Plus, the thinner hook makes it take less ear-top space, sliding gracefully under my glasses temples without the same pressure as before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-in-ear" alt="A close-up of one Shokz OpenFit 2 earbud in the reviewer's left ear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1833" height="1031" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, you got used to the Shokz OpenFit's fit for abbreviated workouts, but you'll enjoy wearing the OpenFit 2 for longer stretches.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit design has no ANC and minimal passive blocking, but that's the whole point. I wear these while reading or doing chores around the house because I never miss my partner or cat calling for attention.</p><p>There's some noise pollution for bass-heavy songs if you put the volume loud enough — so it may not be the best fit for an office environment — but at the normal 25% volume I use indoors, people only hear something if they fully disregard my personal space and lean in.</p>
<h2 id="shokzingly-rich-sound-2">Shokzingly rich sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-speakers" alt="The Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds sitting on a rock, both flipped over to show the main speakers that sit against your ears." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Equally important to comfort is sound, and the OpenFit 2 needed an upgrade. I noted that you "shouldn't necessarily expect a symphony for your ears" with the original OpenFits, defaulting to the Bass Boost option to offer reasonable low-end oomph and tolerating having to pump up the volume to the upper levels just to hear phone calls or podcasts clearly. At least for "normal" music, the sound sounded better than you'd expect, thanks to the "DirectPitch" tech.</p><p>Shokz directly addressed these issues with the OpenFit 2, adding a larger low-frequency driver and an independent high-frequency unit for "DualBoost Technology."</p><p>Ditching the marketing speak, I feel much more comfortable using the stock EQ setting because it hits highs and lows in a balanced, rich way; "luther" by Kendrick Lamar & SZA sounds rich and harmonious for both the deep and high portions, while Tommy Richman's "MILLION DOLLAR BABY" hits those falsetto notes and low beat with equal quality.</p><p>For folks seeking that alternative (or emo) feel, Billie Eilish's "WILDFLOWER" or Bon Iver's "Holocene" no longer sound quite as tinny as they did on the first-gen earbuds; in fact, the OpenFit 2 hits hard enough that even 50% volume is too loud for me for these quiet songs (unless I'm outside and dealing with ambient noise).</p><p>Now that I've started using these earbuds for my daily work grind, I do use the Treble Boost or Voice EQ settings for my instrumental & lo-fi soundtracks or my YouTube Let's Plays, but they generally sound quite lovely.</p><p>Honestly, the only negative to this audio boost is that when the music is loud enough, it'll get in the way of hearing your surroundings a bit. But as long as you're not blowing up your eardrums, you'll be bopping to the beat, <em>and</em> you'll remain alert.</p>

<p>Other key OpenFit 1-to-2 changes include a more energy-efficient Bluetooth chip, new physical buttons for touch controls, and one IP-level boost to water resistance.</p><p>The jump from Bluetooth 5.2 to 5.4 lets the OpenFit 2 sit in a low-power mode for much longer in case you forget to put them in the charging case, as well as stay strongly connected in busy signal areas. The original OpenFit earbud had the same capacity, and yet the OpenFit 2 is rated to last 11 hours, a four-hour jump. In my experience, they did last easily across an entire workday of streaming, and ultramarathoners can depend on the OpenFit 2 more.</p><p>By improving from IP54 to IP55 protection, Shokz made the OpenFit 2 capable of withstanding water jets; they're shower-proof and easier to safely clean under a strong sink, in other words. Your OpenFits are going to get gunked up with sweat over time, and the better resistance might make them last a bit longer before the speaker and mic quality are affected.</p><p>My favorite upgrade is the new physical button, however. The first-gen OpenFit solely used touchpad controls, and I can't tell you how often they failed to recognize double-taps or made me accidentally hang up on people when I merely wanted to adjust their fit.</p><p>By contrast, the new elevated buttons are easy to find and activate — but no longer something you'll press by mistake. They blend into the silver finish of the earbud, so they don't look tacky or old-fashioned. And most importantly, the touchpad only has one optional-on feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or Siri, eliminating any confusion and frustration.</p>

<p><em>The</em> most important Shokz OpenFit 2 change isn't something Shokz put in its specs sheet. After my initial review period, I noticed that the OpenFit would stay connected to my phone inside the charging case, meaning they weren't charging. I can't tell you how often I'd find <em>one</em> earbud dead and the other fully charged the next day. I'd have to wipe down the magnetic pins and shift the buds around, then close the case and check the app to see if both had successfully disconnected.</p><p>I asked Shokz about this issue since many OpenFit owners had similar complaints. They assured me that the OpenFit 2 had fewer contact points (2 vs. 3) <em>and</em> a much stronger magnet than the last-gen buds. You're still supposed to "keep the pins dry and clean during use to avoid any residue affecting proper contact," and it'll take months to see if a similar problem pops up; for now, though, I'm very optimistic, as I can feel how securely the OpenFit 2 snaps into place when inserted.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-shokz-openfit-2-2">Should you buy the Shokz OpenFit 2?</h2>
<p>I still have requests for the Shokz OpenFit 3, most notably wear detection — so they turn off and don't take calls when sitting outside the case — and a way to ping the charging case. If you buy the black OpenFit 2, choose a consistent place to put the case after workouts, or you <em>will</em> lose them constantly. Plus, the Shokz app should ideally notify you when the case hits 0%.</p><p>But these complaints feel more nitpicky compared to the fundamental issues with the first-gen OpenFit. By and large, the Shokz OpenFit 2 sound fantastic, feel natural when worn with glasses, and let you keep your ear canals open instead of having hard plastic shoved into them for hours at a time.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 won't match your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> or even normal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> for surround-sound quality or ANC, so they may not be the right choice if you're looking for an all-day choice for every scenario that closely syncs with your smartphone. It's still a niche and fairly expensive product.</p><p>That said, I fall within the target Shokz OpenFit 2 niche, and I'm supremely happy with them!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Phone cases are a dime a dozen, and most don't go out of the way to look too unique. Occasionally, you might find a really nice thin case or one that slaps your favorite movie characters on the back, but what if you removed 90% of the case and could still protect your phone?</p><p>I first heard of the Arc Pulse case when the company teased its Galaxy S25 Arc Pulse case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/enter_arc/p/DFX55KhTaGf/">a few days ago</a>, and while that case isn't available yet, the company does sell its cases for the Galaxy S24 series, Google Pixel 9 series, and several different iPhones.</p><p>These ultra-minimalist cases are built out of Aluminum 7075-T6 and feature a rubber-like Elastomer inlay to keep them snuggly attached to the phone at all times. The case design is so outlandish there was no way I could pass up the opportunity to test it, and I'm sure glad I did.</p>

<h2 id="the-drop-test-2">The drop test</h2>

<p>Let's just get right to business, shall we?</p><p>I don't often drop test phones in cases because so many cases are very similar, but Arc Pulse is a different beast entirely. For the test, I dropped the phone on three different flooring types: a wood floor, an area rug placed on concrete, and bare concrete. I dropped it at pocket height, roughly 3ft, and at head height, roughly 6ft, to simulate the two most common ways someone might drop their phone.</p><p>To my surprise, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> was spotless after all these drops. No scratches, cracks, or any other damage was found, and the case's unique design is surprisingly effective.</p>

<p>The case is designed to primarily protect the corners of the phone, with a lip around the front and back to keep the glass surfaces from coming into contact with any surface.</p><p>Of course, being so exposed in most places means that it will certainly not survive a drop onto an uneven surface if the screen or back glass hits a rock or something similar. In other words, you'll want to pair this case with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">best Google Pixel 9 Pro XL screen protectors</a> to ensure that screen doesn't get shattered.</p>

<p>Because of the metal construction, the Arc Pulse case feels incredibly high quality and is as shiny as those side rails on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, matching the aesthetic quite nicely. Corner coverage works well because of the weight, helping ensure it most often falls on one of the corners rather than flat on the front or back.</p><p>I've purposefully dropped it about a dozen times now and haven't seen a time when it fell flat on its face or back. Even if I dropped the phone flat, it would angle to one of the corners naturally before hitting the ground.</p>

<p>After several drops on the concrete, a crack developed in the top left corner of the Arc Pulse case. This isn't terribly surprising given the sheer weight of the phone and the case together being dropped on hard concrete. Metal is more protective but it's also more rigid than the usual materials used to make a phone case.</p><p>The result is the potential to crack if dropped on other rigid surfaces a lot, but the case has still held together very well despite this damage. Despite the ultra minimalist coverage, I'm super confident about the Arc Pulse case's ability to protect my phone. I was extremely nervous dropping it on concrete but it survived every attempt without scratching or damaging the phone at all, even from 6ft up. That, alone, is worth a recommendation!</p>

So what exactly is this?</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> is an open-source AI ChatBot based on Meta's free and open-source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">Llama 3.3,</a> trained by the DeepSeek team. But what's fueling the hype is that the company claims they developed this LLM at an exponentially lower price than most other LLMs we know of today. By comparison, OpenAI charges $200 a month for ChatGPT Pro, while DeepSeek R1 gives you the same skills as the LLM for free.</p><p>While understanding how this large language model is gaining its skills, AI analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=803X112721&xs=1&url=https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/1884167945280278857&xcust=4-1-2591529-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2591529/deepseek-ai-confirmed-to-be-powered-by-a-huawei-chip.html">Alexander Doria</a> confirmed in a recent X post the chip powering the DeepSeek R1 model, stating that DeepSeek’s R1 large-language model (LLM) was first trained using NVIDIA's H100, but now it fully functions on Huawei’s Ascend 910C chip to generate responses.</p><p>DeepSeek seems to be shifting the norm by making well-developed AI accessible to everyone for free and being independent of U.S-based chip companies putting them at risk. For the first time,  NVIDIA took a massive hit on Monday, losing $593 billion in market value as their stocks tanked.</p><p>It remains to be seen how this AI model will take on the big players in the business and whether it will be able to keep up its hype.</p>

After two days of experimenting with a fix, Garmin said, "We have resolved the underlying issue causing some devices to be stuck on the startup screen or a blue triangle" on a banner located on its Garmin Support page.</p><p>And if you "Press and hold the power/light button on the device until the watch shuts off," turn it back on, then sync it with your Connect app or plug it into your computer's Garmin Express app, it should solve your watch's issue and replace the malicious file that caused this issue.</p>

It all began when a Samsung blog and some Amazon listings suggested that a Bluetooth S Pen that is compatible with the  Galaxy S25 Ultra could be bought separately.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra launched without a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, built-in or sold separately. This is why, when a Samsung Business Insights <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_in_2910707877423328934&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Finsights.samsung.com%2F2025%2F01%2F24%2Fhow-to-boost-productivity-with-the-s-pen-on-your-galaxy-s25-ultra%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fmixed-reports-about-a-separate-bluetooth-s-pen-for-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-have-fans-puzzled" target="_blank">blog</a> suggested that Galaxy S25 Ultra owners <em>could</em> buy a Bluetooth S Pen separately, it came as a relief for some. Additionally, some Amazon listings for the official S25 Ultra S Pen in certain regions also mention Bluetooth support. Samsung's official listings didn't mention this; however, the situation quickly snowballed since the listing shows only the standard Galaxy S25 Ultra S Pen and the S Pen Pro.</p><p>Later, attempts to link the S Pen Pro to the S25 Ultra during a media briefing failed, and a Samsung exec eventually confirmed the two aren’t compatible.</p><p>Fast forward two days, Samsung had to remove all mentions of a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen from the blog post.</p>

Meta earned $48 billion in revenue during Q4 2024, and the company's full-year earnings totaled $164 billion, a 22% increase over 2023's $134 billion in overall revenue.</p><p>Meta attributed these massive numbers to ads revenue, bringing in a record-breaking $46.7 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs division also broke records with $1.08 billion in revenue. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that ad revenue was up for two primary reasons: 3.35 billion people used Meta products and services in 2024, delivering more ad impressions, while the average price per ad simultaneously increased 14% YoY.</p><p>Looking into 2025, Meta will be launching "a new, more personalized AI," and the company expects to reach 1 billion users by year's end. The company teased 2025 as the year "we get back to the OG Facebook" but didn't expand on that. Instagram, Reels, WhatsApp, and Threads also are expected to continue to grow throughout 2025.</p><p>Furthermore, Meta revealed that it plans to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">billions of smart glasses</a> on the market, which sounds like a hefty goal given the current growth trajectory of the market.</p>

Chances are, most of them are going to tell you how great the thing is and that it is totally worth the money. Reviews are like that; it's not a knock on anyone who writes them or implying anything inappropriate, it's just that we like new things, especially when they are better than the things they're designed to replace.</p><p>I'm not going to be reviewing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a>. I hate reviewing phones, and I'm terrible at it, so my constant complaining about them has finally borne fruit, and I don't get tasked with writing them now. Never let it be said that complaining over and over can't be effective. I am, however, going to tell you that no matter how great the S25 seems to be, I'd wait until next year to buy one.</p>

<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't buy one, so the pitchforks can be put away. I am saying that there are some good reasons to hold off on buying any new phone, and one that has this many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/some-galaxy-s25-users-start-seeing-an-iphone-style-battery-feature-pop-up">new changes and features</a> is definitely one you could wait on picking up.</p><p>I hate buying a new phone. I hate setting up a million things on a new phone, I hate it when apps don't keep track of their associated data and start up empty, and I especially hate opening my dusty wallet and spending money. That's why I love that phone makers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-says-new-pixels-and-galaxys-will-get-longer-software-support-than-iphones">support their products longer and longer</a> — it means I can wait.</p>
<p>It didn't used to be that way. I bought every new phone that tickled my fancy and never thought about a reason not to do so. That taught me a very important lesson — every new smartphone will have bugs. Some phones, namely anything chock full of new features, will be riddled with them.</p>
<p>I'm talking about both hardware and software bugs. Just because a new phone looks like the old model doesn't mean everything under the screen hasn't been changed. New phones get new hardware, and that means they have to make the changes to allow the software to work with it all.</p>

<p>The worst offenders, by a longshot, were always Google's own phones. Nexus phones and the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel line</a> all launched with a list of issues because they are a testbed for new features and new ways to use cheap hardware. Google should be the company doing this; it needs to experiment with ways to use and develop the platform, but putting a retail, consumer-grade label on testbed phones means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-wireless-charging-woes-reported">a lot of people will see a lot of issues</a>.</p><p><strong>The Galaxy S25 is Samsung's Pixel phone.</strong> It's the beginning of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-bixby-integration-announced">completely integrating AI</a> into every facet of the experience, not just the user-facing features,  using new hardware to do it. The new Samsung-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-shows-samsung-should-build-a-snapdragon-clone">custom Snapdragon paired with a new AI accelerator</a> is going to require plenty of software tweaking, and the user-facing software is never going to be completely finished. It will keep changing and improving until the phone reaches its end-of-life for support, only to be replaced with a new model that will be the same.</p>

<p>You might love this idea. I can relate — I used to feel the same back when I wanted to try and tweak everything in ways that broke warranties and circumvented corporate restrictions. Now, I'm not worried about trying new exploits to see if I can find a way to root a Snapdragon phone or break bootloader security. I don't see the need like I used to so I pass that torch to others and happily watch them try and fail, knowing they love doing it. The joy is in trying, just as much as succeeding.</p><p>Regular users (like I've become) just want everything to work. Hopefully, it will be as good as promised or even better, but at least perform in a way that isn't disruptive. The S25 will probably do just that — I don't expect any actual problems with the device that would cause you to stop using it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> is that way, too. I can get that near-excellent level of use without shelling out another $1,000. Next year, when they are half-price, would be the time I would look at buying an S25.</p>

I previously reviewed the Galaxy S24 Plus, so Samsung’s latest model feels both familiar and like a welcome refresh. In fact, with such a strong focus on AI, it's feeling more like I'm using a suped-up Pixel than a Galaxy phone.</p><p>Here are a few things that have stood out to me so far while using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>.</p>

<p>For the past few years, I’ve been pretty unimpressed with Samsung’s color selection. The main hues for the S series phones have shifted toward pastels, and I constantly complain that it makes Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-boring-design">already boring-looking phones</a> appear even more dull. This year, things haven’t changed too much, as most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-color-should-you-buy">color options for the Galaxy S25 Plus</a> are still boring, but the standout colorway is the new Navy option.</p><p>The Navy Galaxy S25 Plus is the best color Samsung has launched for a phone since the green <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a>. I love blue, so I'm a little biased, but the Navy hue is a deep blue with a very slight shimmer that almost glistens in direct sunlight. Depending on the angle and lighting, the phone almost appears indigo, which was a similar effect to the green Galaxy S22, which appeared blue in certain lighting. The frosted glass on the back is nicely contrasted with the thick black camera rings in the corner, while the flat frame gives off an almost neon glow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4214px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UPRSGtTutKUDYmPm4852g5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-and-Galaxy-S22" alt="The Galaxy S25 Plus next to the Galaxy S22" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UPRSGtTutKUDYmPm4852g5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4214" height="2370" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Samsung, the color is actually inspired by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, closely matching the hue of the signature sparkle icon that accompanies many consumer-facing features on Android phones. And given how focused the new phones are on AI, it’s a nice way to merge the design with the software. I admit that the phone’s design is still pretty tame, especially compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. However, a great color selection really helps make things pop.</p><p>This is something Motorola figured out with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. These phones aren’t offered in simple colors like black, white, or silver; each <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">Razr Plus 2024 color</a> is vibrant and unique, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-sets-trend-for-pink-phones">Hot Pink option</a>, which is a result of its partnership with Pantone. The Galaxy S25 series isn’t quite there yet, and many of the other color options retain the bland pastels (I guess someone must like them?), but with colors like Navy and even the Samsung-exclusive Coralred, the Galaxy S25 Plus already looks much more compelling than its predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="one-ui-7-is-smooth-like-butter-2">One UI 7 is smooth like butter</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gCtzEbhj3PCSKj7d6NpSeE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-One-UI-7-home-screen" alt="One UI 7 home screen on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCtzEbhj3PCSKj7d6NpSeE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4156" height="2338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus may look largely the same on the outside, but once you turn the phone on, it’s a different story. One UI 7 feels so good to use, and I already feel like this is the best version of Samsung’s software to date.</p><p>I’ve unapologetically been a big fan of One UI for some time, as I think the UI manages its space much better than the Pixel software. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, Samsung changed plenty of things around that make the software feel somewhat Pixel-like with its more bubbly UI elements while retaining the more efficient Samsung flair I’ve come to love while tweaking it in ways that I find pretty smart.</p><p>For instance, there’s now a <em>vertical</em> app drawer. Previously, in order to get a vertically scrolling app drawer, you’d have to install the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> app and go through the modules and settings. Now, you just have to change the app drawer to alphabetical sorting, which will change it from its default horizontal pagination (why it’s still the default is beyond me).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4193px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="949G5LxCYcVscWtEUTtmZ4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Quick-Panel" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/949G5LxCYcVscWtEUTtmZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4193" height="2359" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there’s the Quick Panel and notification shade. By default, they’re separate, and while many people may not like this iPhone-esque take on the UI, it’s something I’ve gotten used to from other OEMs like Motorola. I already liked Samsung’s revamped take with One UI 6, which retains Wi-Fi and Bluetooth buttons as well as other settings like brightness, media output, and more.</p><p>One UI 7 takes it a step further with additional customization, and all the settings you want are more or less at your fingertips with the full-page Quick Panel. Samsung even took after the app drawer by ditching the horizontal scrolling for the customizable quick settings by turning it into an expandable panel.</p><p>I also like how notifications are displayed. If you get more than one notification from the same app, they’ll often stack on top of each other so as not to take up too much space from other notifications. This behavior also mimics the new multitasking screen, which also stacks open apps behind each other instead of placing them side by side. It all just makes for a more visually appealing and cohesive experience, and it feels like Samsung really thought this through.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-notification-shade" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also can’t go without talking about how good it feels to use One UI 7. Everything you do feels so smooth and buttery without feeling like you’re stuck waiting for transitions to finish before doing the next thing. The lock and home screens feel like they’re floating up at you when you turn on the display, the Quick Panel and notification shade have a nice kinetic bounce to them, and animations between apps and screens are slick.</p><p>The experience is a stark contrast to One UI 6 on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, which feels stiff by comparison. And while Android 15 on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> is admittedly very fast and fluid, even that feels like a half-step behind One UI 7. I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed the feeling of a UI this much.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-giving-pixel-2">It's giving Pixel</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-display-home-screen-01" alt="Comparing the display and home screens of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But enough about how the software feels; what is it actually doing for me? Well, a lot, it turns out. Or, at least, it’s trying to. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-just-not-excited-about-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">Samsung didn’t make hardware changes</a> this year, which I’m still a little bummed about. However, with all the focus on AI, it now feels like Samsung is trying to turn the Galaxy S series into its very own Pixels.</p><p>Out of the box, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> is just a click away with a long press of the power button. While I don't care for this method of evoking an AI assistant (it's a power button, let's keep it that way), it emphasizes Samsung and Google's strong partnership to bring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-gains-new-android-share-screen-shortcut">latest and greatest of Gemini</a> first to the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>One thing I appreciate about the Pixel is that it seems to want to make your life easier by putting the AI features you <em>might</em> want right at your fingertips. That's what I feel Samsung has been working towards since debuting Galaxy AI on the S24 series, and it's even more prevalent with the S25 Plus just how much it wants to be a Pixel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Audio-Eraser" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Audio Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Drawing Assist got an upgrade, which basically turns it into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, allowing you to create or alter images from drawings or text. AI Select is essentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> without the search, letting you extract content from your screen to perform various actions like editing an image, translating text, creating a GIF, and more.</p><p>Audio Eraser is Samsung’s version of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Magic Audio Eraser</a>, which analyzes a video to let you remove certain sounds. In my limited use of Audio Eraser on some videos I took over New Year's Eve with another phone, the feature works shockingly well, removing very loud music so that I could only hear my voice in the clips.</p><p>Then there's the Now Bar and Now Brief. These two features I'm most intrigued by, and I feel like there's quite a bit of potential there, even if they don't quite live up to it yet. Now Bar acts like a bottom-mounted Dynamic Island, which shows music controls, timers, live sports scores, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-prepares-one-ui-7-wider-rollout">Google Maps directions</a>. It should act as a pretty handy way to interact with apps directly from your lock screen, although so far, my interactions with it have been limited, and it's not quite as useful a feature as I had hoped.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rkH4m2Qvjo4RvGG3LCDRP5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Morning-Brief" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Morning Brief" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rkH4m2Qvjo4RvGG3LCDRP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The same goes for Now Brief, which also appears in the Now Bar during certain times of the day (or you can set a widget on your home screen). It's basically a summary of your morning, afternoon, and evening, which should recall various information based on your health stats, calendar, and more, almost like Morning Brief on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, while I get some of that info, the briefs aren't as insightful or informative as I would like, showing me the weather, upcoming calendar events, and suggesting Spotify songs to me. I still have not seen any health stats appear in my brief despite actively using Samsung Health. I also wish it was more proactive at showing me my briefs outside of the lock screen, perhaps with a notification.</p><p>Still, I see where Samsung is going with these features, and they have a lot of potential. I imagine the Now Bar will feel more useful when it gains more support from third-party apps, and I'm hoping I'll get more out of Now Brief after I use the phone more.</p>

<p>While I couldn't be less impressed with how little Samsung upgraded the Galaxy S25 Plus hardware, I'm surprisingly enjoying the phone more than I expected to. It’s nappy, the software feels quite polished, and the Navy hue is the only color worth getting. So far, it feels like the Pixel phone I've always wanted.</p><p>I don't love everything, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">unnecessary changes with lock screen notifications</a> to the seeming removal of the swipe gesture to evoke the assistant. Samsung also has some odd choices for default settings that I find a little questionable.</p><p>That said, there's still quite a bit that I want to test out more thoroughly, including the cameras, battery life, overall performance, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2 MagSafe charging</a> (provided I get my hands on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-cases">Galaxy S25 Plus case</a> that supports MagSafe). You can look forward to all of this and more in my full review of the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p>

As evidenced by the 3,000+ words from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on</a>, I clearly came out on the other side with more than a few thoughts. Fast forward to now, and I've been using the Galaxy S25 Ultra for about a week, but for some reason, I'm kind of at an impasse.</p><p>I can't help but feel as though I was looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> through Samsung's rose-tinted (or blue) glasses. Everything that was announced and demoed sounded wonderful, and in that initial two-ish hours, it was. I was excited about the chance to try out the obvious front-runner for the best Android phone of the year. And I was even more excited about the various Gemini and Galaxy AI-powered improvements that were promised.</p><p>Over the past week, there have been quite a few things that I've noticed and a few things that I would have forgotten about if it weren't for my RSS feeds and social media.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-2">The good</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hanx7EejjunZdapcxYhb43" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-iphone-16-pro-max-galaxy-z-fold-6-galaxy-s24-ultra-angled-profile-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with S24 Ultra, Z Fold 6, and iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hanx7EejjunZdapcxYhb43.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Maybe it's just because I'm used to the iPhone's design, but I actually rather like what Samsung has done with the S25 Ultra. I don't know if I like it more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra">S24 Ultra</a>, but at the very least, it's kind of refreshing to see Samsung largely use the same design language across <em>all</em> of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">its flagship phones</a>. That includes the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6.</p><p>I've always been a sucker for a good metal and glass sandwich, and the S25 Ultra easily checks the box. Using a phone that matches the price tag isn't always a foregone conclusion, but I still have to give credit where it's due.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4FkKSraWWVK96gkRReyk73" name="samsung-ecosystem-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Samsung ecosystem of devices including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Buds 3 Pro, Samsung laptop, and Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4FkKSraWWVK96gkRReyk73.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that I've thoroughly enjoyed is re-entering the Samsung ecosystem. Before the S25 Ultra landed on my doorstep, I managed to snag the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> for around $200 thanks to a random trade-in promotion. And seeing as I was already getting the itch for some new earbuds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> were quickly added to my cart.</p><p>A few years ago, I probably would've been one of the first to mock Samsung's attempts at imitating Apple. Now, I'm actually just grateful that the ecosystem pretty much just works. There are a few hiccups that aren't related to the S25 Ultra specifically, but I'll have thoughts on that in an upcoming article. If anything, it proved just how important having an ecosystem of products that seamlessly work together can be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9pjQQ9MnKErHsv2WUmiBV7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-morning-now-brief" alt="Morning Now Brief on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pjQQ9MnKErHsv2WUmiBV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you read my initial impressions, then you probably noticed that I couldn't shut up about AI. I'm going to save most of my opinions for the final review, but I have to point out how much I've actually enjoyed having the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Now Brief</a> widget on my home screen. It's become part of my daily routine, as I tap the widget, and it updates throughout the day just to see what will show up.</p><p>Having certain bits of information presented to me is really nice, especially for someone who slightly obsesses over how much sleep they get. Amplifying this "issue" is the Energy Score from the Watch Ultra, but that's not actually a bad thing. It just feeds into my obsession as I look forward to seeing what kind of suggestions for improvements are made.</p>
<h2 id="the-annoying-2">The annoying</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-brief-news" alt="Now Brief News on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For as quickly as Now Brief has quickly become part of my daily routine, it also didn't take long to realize one of its pitfalls. Near the bottom of the page, you're occasionally presented with news that "you might be interested in." However, no matter what I've tried to do, it only ever recommends news that I couldn't care less about.</p><p>I thought that it might be something to do with the Samsung News app despite never actually using it. So I went through and tried to prune the topics, but that doesn't seem to have done anything. Instead, my Now Brief dashboard still manages to show me the "wrong" news.</p><p>Before you ask, yes, I double-checked the Now Brief settings, as there's a "Content to include" section. Unfortunately, you can't change any of the topics from here and can only enable or disable the "News" from showing up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="acMY653XDcyhFGGfH8nTWE" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-options-3" alt="Various cases for the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/acMY653XDcyhFGGfH8nTWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as design goes, I appreciate the Galaxy S25 Ultra's redesign, but there's one nagging issue. See, for the first couple of days after getting the S25 Ultra, I didn't have a case for it. I'm not much of a case guy anyway, with the exception of using either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait">Fiberborne (formerly Thinborne) case</a> or a Dbrand skin.</p><p>However, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is so slippery that I was constantly worried that the phone was going to slip out of my hands. Between that and seeing that a few of Samsung's first-party cases are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/quick-a-bunch-of-galaxy-s25-cases-are-50-percent-off-at-best-buy-but-the-sale-wont-last-long">50% off at Best Buy</a>, I ended up grabbing a couple of them. Unfortunately, none of my local Best Buy stores had the "Ultra Clear Magnet Case," so I opted for the Silicone, Kindsuit, and Standing Grip cases.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This leads me to another annoyance, as I really wish Samsung would have adopted the magnetic portion of the Qi2 protocol. It's cool and all that the S25 series is the first to support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi 2.1 standard</a>, but I don't actually care about the charging speeds aspect. What I do care about is being able to use one of the myriad of MagSafe accessories that I've accrued over the years, and not being able to is just disappointing.</p><p>As a result, I opted to slap a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe adapter ring</a> to the back of the Silicone case, just so I could use a PopSocket. Maybe this is what Samsung is hoping for because if the S25 Ultra had the appropriate magnets, I probably wouldn't have bothered to buy a case. I mean, why would I consider that using a PopSocket would have given me some peace of mind to use the phone without a case?</p>

<p>Lastly, I've been a bit frustrated when it comes to trying to use emulators on the S25 Ultra. Samsung isn't to blame for part of my frustration, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> just hasn't been out long enough for higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators</a> to be properly optimized. For the most part, Switch and Winlator emulation is at the mercy of the stock drivers, which are frankly lackluster.</p><p>I'm working on something a bit more in-depth surrounding emulation on Android, but again, that's not Samsung's problem.</p><p>Something that has been gnawing away at me is that Samsung went on stage and talked about how the S25 Ultra has a "40% larger" vapor chamber for cooling. That's truly wonderful for mobile gaming in general, but the whole time I'm just thinking about the Apple-like storage constraints.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3Kco8nfDjnF5wtVTQ5YE7" name="switch-emulation-galaxy-s25-ultra-ayaneo-pocket-dmg-1" alt="Switch emulation on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and AYANEO Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3Kco8nfDjnF5wtVTQ5YE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having 256GB as the base configuration is great and all, but the only way to get more is by shelling out more cash to Samsung. It's also great that Samsung is basically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">giving you a storage upgrade for free</a> during the pre-order phase. But that doesn't do anything for those who missed the window or just can't upgrade right now.</p><p>So, for someone who has an ever-growing library of ROMs and DRM-free games for Winlator, 256GB just isn't enough. For example, at this moment, I have less than 40GB of space left on the S25 Ultra. That might seem like a lot, but in reality, that will be gone in no time as I take more pictures with my son's first birthday around the corner.</p><p>I guess what I want to see is for Samsung to release an "Ultra" that spares no expense. The Galaxy S25 Ultra gets about 95% of the way there, but what's holding it back from releasing a "Special Edition" model that brings back the BLE S Pen and includes a microSD card slot?</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly-2">The ugly</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo" name="top-down-s-pen-settings-multiple-s-pens-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Top-down view of the S Pen settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra surrounded by different types of S Pens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a shadow of a doubt, the S Pen "debacle" has made me just want to avoid social media and my RSS feeds more than anything else. It's been a week and there's already so much "outrage" that it's simply pathetic. Samsung removed BLE from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mixed-reports-about-a-separate-bluetooth-s-pen-for-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-have-fans-puzzled">based on the response</a>, you might've thought Samsung took away the headphone jack again.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I understand the potential arguments. Samsung shouldn't be removing any features from a phone that starts at $1,200. And if you were one of the few that did use Air Commands, then it probably feels like some sort of betrayal.</p><p>Samsung didn't do itself any favors either. While the reasons were explained in my hands-on session, there was no mention of it during Galaxy Unpacked. Then, we watched as conflicting reports suggested the S25 Ultra would work with some unannounced BLE-enabled S Pen, only for others to suggest they wouldn't.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MSKXLU7Ks6pvjLMPTeRcPL" name="samsung-s-pen-pro-galaxy-s25-ultra-z-fold-6" alt="S Pen Pro on Galaxy Z Fold 6 next to Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSKXLU7Ks6pvjLMPTeRcPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I spent more than an hour messing around with the multitude of S Pens that I could find, trying to figure out an answer. Only to come to a rather weird, yet semi-helpful, conclusion — technically you can use other S Pens with the S25 Ultra, but you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">can't use Air Actions</a>, and they first have to be paired with another Galaxy device that is signed into the same Samsung account as your S25 Ultra.</p><p>Adding more fuel to the fire is that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">took Samsung several days</a> to even provide some official guidance. In that time, there have been numerous articles, and apparently, there's even a petition going around to bring BLE back to the S Pen. It's just been mind-numbing and I fear that it will only pick up once the S25 Ultra is in the hands of more people than just reviewers and influencers.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-currently-stand-with-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-2">Where do I currently stand with the Galaxy S25 Ultra?</h2>

<p>After seeing how I felt following my hands-on session, I actually thought that the S25 Ultra might be able to replace my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. And since coming into my possession, it's actually been able to do that for everything besides phone calls and text messages.</p><p>The design is fantastic and just looks stunning, even with how slippery it is. Emulation woes aside, performance has been exactly what I hoped it would be, and I'm able to make it through an entire day (and then some) before even thinking about battery life. I'm also excited to see what kind of changes and improvements Samsung will bring to the on-device AI and Now Brief features.</p><p>Perhaps more surprising than anything is that I'm contemplating jumping in on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">pre-order bonanza</a> and snagging a 1TB model. Mainly because I want to see what it's like to go back to the "one phone" lifestyle, which would mean moving my SIM card out of the iPhone and into the S25 Ultra. And this is the first non-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> that has managed to really move that needle at all for me.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>E-readers are often mistaken for single-purpose devices with eye-friendly displays. Of course, modern e-paper devices are so much more than that. Onyx Boox is a brand that has worked hard at excelling in this category, defeating the likes of the Amazon Kindle for the throne.</p><p>The Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C is a colorized and updated iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Onyx Boox Note Air 3</a>, reviewed by my colleague Harish Jonnalagadda. The Note Air 3 has a colorized version called the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C, which begs the question, why should you buy the newer, more expensive model?</p><p>As with any new release, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C has upgraded internals and software. After using it for a few months, I have some thoughts about the Note Air 4 C. Let's dive into the details.</p>

<h2 id="there-s-a-new-color-onyx-boox-in-town-and-it-s-as-sleek-as-ever-2">There's a new color Onyx Boox in town and it's as sleek as ever</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3928px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2XywHTenWDXHuFVKpWicUh" name="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XywHTenWDXHuFVKpWicUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3928" height="2209" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Onyx Boox stays busy, launching new models of its black & white as well as colored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablets</a> loaded with Android every few months. The Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C was released on October 23, 2024. Interestingly, there is no grayscale Note Air 4 to go with the 4 C.</p><p>You can purchase the Note Air 4 C for $499.99 from Onyx Boox's website or retailers like Amazon. It comes with a stylus in the box and a charging cable, but the accompanying Note Air 4 C Cover needs to be bought separately for another $50.99.</p>
<p>Onyx Boox outfitted the Note Air 4C with an upgraded Kaleido 3 color E Ink panel which delivers better brightness and contrast levels, as well as a higher screen refresh rate. The 10.3-inch e-paper display has an anti-glare layer on top and a Wacom layer to support the included EMR stylus.</p>

<p>Design wise, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C looks exactly the same as the last-gen Note Air 3 C. Both e-readers are equally slim at lightweight, measuring 226mm x 193mm x 5.8mm in size and coming in at a lightweight 430 grams.</p>
<p>To make you understand just how sleek this thing is, I compared it to the brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Next to this slim and trim e-ink tablet, the S25 Ultra looks chunky. It's amazing, considering this is an older design, whereas Samsung's flagship phone is hot out of the oven and hasn't even started shipping yet.</p>

<p>There are no physical buttons apart from the power button. The microSD card slot is still located in the spine of the tablet, along with the USB-C port for 15W wired charging. You can also use a USB-C thumb drive with the Note Air 4 C as it supports USB-C OTG.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's no ingress protection yet again this year, so you have to be super careful when handling the Note Air 4 C near liquids and grainy solid particles.</p>
<h2 id="the-software-is-the-biggest-draw-with-boox-tablets-2">The software is the biggest draw with Boox tablets</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gzGqTrcyvzcCeeT3dbJCAk" name="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzGqTrcyvzcCeeT3dbJCAk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C has a speedier octa-core chipset and beefier 6GB RAM, adding 2GB to the Note Air 3 C's 4GB of RAM. The result is noticeably improved performance, fewer instances of ghosting, and better loading times in general. It's still nowhere near as snappy as a full-blown Android tablet, of course, but it's one of the fastest e-paper tablets that money can buy right now.</p><p>Boosted internals go hand in hand with newer software. The Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C comes with Android 13 installed out of the box as opposed to the Note Air 3 C, which came with Android 12. This might seem old seeing as we are on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> in the smartphone sector now. But for e-readers, that's quite advanced. Not to mention, Onyx Boox promises to deliver at least three years of firmware updates to all of its devices. Most Boox tabs probably get more than that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WLEBSqiWByjtuMYoXoAe4g" name="onyx-boox-note-air-4-c-goodreads-lifestyle" alt="Goodreads app on the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLEBSqiWByjtuMYoXoAe4g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi  / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest draw with an Onyx Boox e-reader is that you get unfettered access to Android apps, and the Play Store is pre-installed. Amazon blocks this ability on all Kindle e-readers, limiting what you can do with a Kindle to a great extent. The Note Air 4 is ripe with possibilities. You can try installing any Android app in the sun. Even if it's incompatible, you can tweak and optimize it using Onyx Boox's built-in customizability tools.</p><p>The NeoReader is a fantastic e-book app with extensive tools and options baked in. Note-taking is also a treat on the Note Air 4 C, thanks to Boox's Notes app, which has OCR built-in so that you can convert hand-written notes on the fly. Onyx Boox offers so many useful reading and writing functions that it's hard to list out everything.</p><p>Like every other tech brand, Onyx Boox has also hopped aboard the AI bandwagon. You get neat AI features pre-loaded on the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C, such as the Boox AI Assistant and AI Read. This makes the NeoReader more intelligent than ever before.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9Nco6KYEus8GB5cyEWBptQ" name="onyx-boox-palma-vs-boox-palma-2-lockscreen" alt="Comparing the displays between the Onyx Boox Palma and the Onyx Boox Palma 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Nco6KYEus8GB5cyEWBptQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are plenty of e-readers out there, but very few can do what the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C can. If you don't care about Android smarts and just want a cheap e-reader for nothing but reading, the most straightforward answer is a cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-2022-review">Amazon Kindle</a>.</p><p>Other competing brands include Bigme, Kobo, and Pocketbook. However, none of these companies have e-readers that run Android 13, come with color displays, and consistently receive software updates.</p><p>Ironically, if you're looking for a cheaper alternative, the most suitable option comes from Onyx Boox themselves. The smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-launch-details">Boox Palma 2 launched alongside the Note Air 4 C</a> and costs only $279.99. It features a 6.13-inch E Ink Carta 1200 display that only outputs shades of black and white. The nifty little Palma 2 has many of the smarts of the 4 C despite its stature, and it one-ups the larger tab thanks to its splash-proof design.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-worth-buying-the-onyx-boox-note-air-4-c-2">Is it worth buying the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3699px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="f7cux64wG4Pn2ZopzMLhNh" name="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7cux64wG4Pn2ZopzMLhNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3699" height="2081" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest processor and higher RAM</li><li>You want a versatile e-reader for note-taking</li><li>You're a student or someone who needs to write a lot</li><li>You want a colorful e-reader</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need ingress protection like water-resistance and dust-proofing</li><li>Your budget is extremely tight</li></ul>
<p>As much as I love the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C, almost $500 is a hefty price to pay for such a niche device. It's a wonderful e-reader that's perfect for note-taking, with no limitations and unrestricted access to Android apps via the Play Store. However, everything that I love about this tablet overlaps with the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C.</p><p>Frankly speaking, beyond the menial hardware upgrade such as the faster processor and newer Bluetooth chip, there's not a lot there to justify buying the Note Air 4 C over its predecessor. You can score the Note Air 3 C for $50 less and it still gets the same firmware upgrades as the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C.</p><p>If Android 13 is of great importance to you, the newer Boox e-reader makes sense. But in most cases, I'd suggest opting for the older Note Air 3 C instead. Make no mistake, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C is a spectacular device. It's just that it doesn't add much over the last-gen 3 C, at least not enough to justify a $50 price difference.</p>

<ul><li>There is a new version of Pixel Camera available for download on Pixel phones.</li><li>A patch update of Pixel Camera version 9.7 is rolling out now via the Google Play Store.</li><li>The update appears to include no new features, and instead builds off the earlier v9.7 update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making a new version of the Pixel Camera app available for download through the Google Play Store; however, the update appears to be a small patch with bug fixes based on the existing Pixel Camera app version 9.7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-camera-9-7-patch-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The new version of the Pixel Camera app carries a version number of <strong>9.7.047.710329721.21</strong>, and replaces version <strong>9.7.047.702121536.18</strong>. It has a download size of 574 megabytes, though the update will of course be smaller if you already have the app installed on your Pixel phone. The Google Play Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera" target="_blank">listing</a> for Pixel Camera confirms that it was last updated today, Jan. 30, 2025.</p><p>The update is widely becoming available for all eligible Pixel phones, including the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>. There are no new features listed in the changelog for the app, and there are no visible changes after installing the update. As such, this is almost certainly a minor patch with either bug fixes or security patches, or both.</p><p>Most recently, version 9.7 of the Pixel Camera app added a few new features. The update re-introduced manual controls for certain camera settings, like brightness, white balance, and shadows. This is through a new <strong>Quick access</strong> controls section that you can tap from the Pixel Camera viewfinder. This reverses a change made with version 9.1 of the Pixel Camera app that made these controls more difficult to access.</p><p>In other news, v9.7 also added Dual Screen Portrait Mode for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and Pixel Fold. The earlier version 9.6 added an underwater mode, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">easier astrophotography mode access</a>, and vertical panoramas.</p><p>You can install the latest Pixel Camera update via the Google Play Store now.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to have a Find My Device app for Wear OS in the works.</li><li>A version of the app was spotted in a five-month-old promotional video for the Pixel Watch 3.</li><li>The app could be released in a future Pixel Feature Drop, Wear OS 5.1, or alongside a future Pixel Watch model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google appears to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device app</a> for Wear OS in the works, as evidenced by a frame hidden in a Google Pixel Watch 3 promotional video that first aired five months ago. The ad, surfaced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1ie8crp/find_my_device_for_watch_shown_in_official_pixel/#lightbox" target="_blank">a Reddit user</a>, shows a Find My Device app optimized for Wear OS with a map and more (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/31/find-my-device-pixel-watch-app/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Despite the video airing so long ago, we haven't heard much about a Wear OS version of the Find My Device app since.</p><p>Most of the apps showcased in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAC75BeGjI&t=17s" target="_blank">video</a>, called "<strong>Meet Google Pixel Watch 3 | Big Screen, Bigger Strides</strong>," are showcasing apps and functionality we've seen before. There is a Nest Doorbell look-in video feed and a TV remote control panel, both of which are new to the Pixel Watch 3. There are also Pixel Watch staples, like playback controls for now-playing media and Fitbit app integration.</p><p>However, the final app screen in this specific frame shows an unreleased app with a map, the date and time a device was last seen, a button to play a sound on the device, and the device's battery life. While not specifically named, this app appears to be a version of Find My Device made specifically for the Pixel Watch 3.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1ie8crp/find_my_device_for_watch_shown_in_official_pixel">Find My Device for Watch shown in Official Pixel Watch 3 commercial?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch">r/PixelWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Pixel Watch wearables can already be used to play a sound with a companion Pixel phone. It's possible that the app snippet shown in the video is an expansion of this existing feature, but it's more likely that it is a sneak peek at a native Find My Device app for Wear OS. Aside from adding a map with more location details, a Find My Device app would enable users to see the location of their earbuds, tablets, and other compatible products.</p><p>One Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1ie8crp/comment/ma7jha0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">shared</a> that it is possible to sideload the Android version of Find My Device onto a Pixel Watch, though it isn't the easiest to navigate.</p><p>It's unclear when the Find My Device app for Wear OS might become available for Pixel Watch users, or users of other Wear OS watches. Google hasn't acknowledged the development of this app outside of a quick appearance in this Pixel Watch 3 debut ad. It's possible that it makes an appearance in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-december-feature-drop-for-pixel-watch-lets-you-peek-at-nest-cameras-from-your-wrist">future Pixel Feature Drop</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-wear-os-5-1-preview-is-now-available-and-its-based-on-android-15">Wear OS 5.1</a>, or alongside a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">future Pixel Watch model</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone should have expected this. AI has been developed to do plenty of things, and it's doing plenty of those things for both good and bad reasons. Iran, for example, used Gemini to research Western defense organizations, conduct reconnaissance, and try to phish data from defense employees. North Korea used it to see how it could attack infrastructure and steal cryptocurrency. Russia leaned heavily on Gemini for malware development.</p><p>This is all possible because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini was trained</a> to know as much about these things as it could. That can be helpful, even aiding in defending against state-sponsored cybercrime. It can also be harmful because people — even the people in charge of spy stuff for other countries — want to see what they can get away with.</p>

<p>Google found over 42 different groups of people using Gemini to craft some sort of attack against Western countries and the people who live in them. That tells me it didn't find hundreds of other groups. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">Generative AI is just too easy to use</a> for things like this, and that can't be ignored.</p><p>This isn't going to go away on its own, and it will only get worse. Using an AI like Gemini to find a way to recon the enemy or attack public infrastructure is a lot easier than putting people in the field to do either. AI is excellent at coding tasks and doesn't care if it's writing "Hello World" or an exploit to disable a bridge. AI also makes it easy — too easy — to impersonate anyone or anything to gain some sort of an advantage.</p><p>I'm not interested in a life of crime, and I assume you aren't either. But if we were, we could use AI to make it all so much easier.</p>

<ul><li>Users have taken to Reddit to discuss receiving a text message from T-Mobile about receiving access to its Starlink satellite messaging beta.</li><li>Users with a Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL have since received messages about the beta.</li><li>Recently, it was reported that T-Mobile customers have been slowly entering the Starlink beta since its start on January 27, per SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users have started reporting an interesting development for Google's recent Pixel series and satellite messaging.</p><p>Reports have appeared in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/just_got_the_starlink_beta_text_on_a_pixel_9_pro/">a thread on Reddit</a>, stating a few Pixel 9 devices have been granted entry to T-Mobile's Starlink satellite messaging beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-t-mobile-starlink-beta-satellite-messaging-3522100/">Android Authority</a>). The original poster (OP) posted a screenshot of a text received on their Pixel 9 Pro that says they've entered the beta. Messages have been going out over the past week or so, per user comments.</p><p>Some users (like the OP) have received access on a Pixel 9 Pro, another user reported access on their Pixel 9 Pro XL; however, the experience isn't all the same.</p><p>Ensuring your device is up-to-date is recommended as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/comment/ma26mv8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states</a> they are running Android 15 with the latest Google Play Systems patch. Strangely, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/comment/ma3np3k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user claims</a> that they are completely updated, yet their satellite connectivity via Starlink's beta never flipped over. These users are simply seeing their Pixel 9 swap to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/satellite-sos-launches-demo-pixel-9">Google's Satellite SOS services</a>, not Starlink's.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/just_got_the_starlink_beta_text_on_a_pixel_9_pro">Just got the Starlink Beta text on a Pixel 9 Pro</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile">r/tmobile</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Of course, your cellular network provider must be T-Mobile to receive a message about your beta eligibility.</p><p>The timing of this lines up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">a recent slew of reports</a> from T-Mobile customers stating access to the beta has been slowly arriving. It seems Android and iOS customers have been seeing messages about access to the Starlink satellite messaging beta through T-Mobile. SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk announced that the beta officially began on January 27.</p><p>Satellite messaging through Starlink supports "medium resolution images, music & audio podcasts," in a comment by Musk. With its arrival, T-Mobile states that all of its "postpaid customers" will receive access to this service for free. This will last throughout the testing period, but it may become more "limited" once it's out and into the public.</p><p>Speaking of limited, if you're on a T-Mobile cell plan and would like to test this service, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">you can register now</a>. Keep in mind that, just as when the registration period opened in December, spaces are limited, so act quickly. Once in, your device will automatically connect to Starlink's satellites to keep you in contact with your loved ones if you're too far from T-Mobile's cell towers.</p>

We think it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android#section-best-haptics">Android game controller with the best haptics</a> due to the HyperSense feature, which makes mobile gaming super immersive.

While this release made remapping buttons much easier than the pre-Pro generation, it only lets you re-map two of the buttons. Additionally, some buyers say that the joysticks could be better, as well as a few buttons that require a slight change of grip.</p><p>Nonetheless, this is a solid pick for any casual user looking to upgrade their mobile gaming experience—and you really can't go wrong with 60% off.</p>

<p>Meta seemingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">found a hit with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, which are the only smart glasses to date to successfully break into pop culture and fashion. However, Meta doesn't share exact sales figures for Ray-Ban Meta glasses. That has made it hard to quantify just how well these Meta smart glasses are selling, until now. In an all-hands meeting with employees seen by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/603674/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-sales" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally revealed how many pairs Meta sold in 2024.</p><p>Zuckerberg revealed that Meta sold over one million units of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> last year. The glasses were first released in October 2023, so this figure doesn't perfectly represent the product's lifetime sales. It does get close, though, and it is certainly impressive for a modern pair of smart glasses.</p><p>"I think one of the questions for us is, are we going to go from 1 million this year to 2 million?," Zuckerberg asked. "Are we going to go from 1 million to 5 million?"</p><p>The Meta chief executive also referenced the company's lead in wearable technology, insinuating that Meta should take advantage of its big lead before others start to catch up.</p><p>"We basically invented the category and our competitors haven’t really shown up yet," Zuckerberg said. "I think we'll probably start seeing some of that maybe a little later this year, maybe next year, but we just have this wide open field right now to run and basically introduce as many people as possible to Meta AI glasses and we should take that opportunity."</p>

<p>Meta appears to be doubling down on smart glasses in the years to come. Per recent reports, the company will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">seed prototype Orion development units to devs</a> ahead of its AR glasses launching for the public. It's also working on a pair of Oakley smart glasses for athletes, and a premium version of Ray-Ban Metas with a heads-up display.</p>
