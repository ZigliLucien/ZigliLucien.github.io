<ul><li>Wear OS 5 is now arriving on the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 alongside the September 2024 update.</li><li>Google encourages users to update the device as it brings new features, several bug fixes, and the standard security patches.</li><li>Google previewed Wear OS 5 earlier this year, which showed users are in for major health features, watch face updates, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rolling out Tuesday (Sept 24) is a major OS upgrade for Google&apos;s Pixel Watch series that you won&apos;t want to delay.</p><p>Google detailed in a press release that the Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2 are now receiving the Wear OS 5 upgrade. The company adds that it encourages device owners to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13044412">update their devices</a> as soon as possible as it brings several system improvements. Watches rocking Wear OS 3.5 and 4 are eligible to grab OS 5.</p><p>Those with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> will receive version <strong>AW2A.240903.005.A1</strong>, while those with the original model will get version "<strong>A2.</strong>"</p><p>Joining this Wear OS 5 upgrade is the (late) September 2024 security update for the Pixel Watches. Google states there are "numerous" bug fixes and performance updates for the smartwatches. Additionally, the company noted "new features" with the update, and while it did not specify the new features, it did point out the new grid-view app launcher, upgraded camera controls, and Pixel Recorder functionality.</p><p>Those eager to dive into the specifics regarding the security patches can check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch">Android Security Bulletin</a>.</p><p>The rollout for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> begins today (Sept 24), but Google states it will continue "over the next week." The update will appear in phases, meaning we won&apos;t all see it on our respective devices simultaneously. Google adds that you will receive a notification about the update&apos;s availability.</p>

<p>In May, Google clued us into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">host of new goodies</a> to consume with Wear OS 5 during its I/O event. Those who love running (and marathons) might enjoy the software&apos;s power efficiency as those longer outings consume 20% less power. Health upgrades are a large part of Wear OS 5 as Google worked to add "debounced goals" and Guided Workouts.</p><p>What&apos;s more, watch faces pick up new "Flavors" and complications so you can tailor your Pixel Watch to your needs and tastes.</p><p>With Wear OS 5 arriving for Google&apos;s previous two watches, hopefully, this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">sign of more consistency</a>. The company&apos;s past shows that its wearable software often takes a back seat compared to its work for smartphones. Google has also launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which shows it&apos;s taking its wearable hardware a little more seriously — as many users have hoped.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 comes in and cleans up whatever you thought could've been better with the second version. Google upgraded this watch with a better battery that should take you a little further beyond 24-hours. More importantly, Wear OS 5 makes a world of difference in terms of UI and health features.</p></p>

At this time, the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C791819Q" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic has crashed 30% to its lowest price ever at Amazon</strong></a>, marking a savings of $120. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is our favorite last-gen watch option, and users especially love it for the return of the Classic&apos;s physical rotating bezel.</p><p>This particular deal is for the black Hybrid Leather T-band version of the smartwatch, and for the Bluetooth-equipped configuration. While this deal is pretty impressive for those who are willing to go with that color and spec, a few other options are also on sale if you need something different. </p>

<p>Amazon has cut 30% off the price of our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-last-gen-option">favorite last-generation smartwatch</a>, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. The deal comes ahead of the retailer's two-day Big Deal Days event, and it brings this great device to its lowest price yet. Will the price drop even further when October Prime Day officially arrives? Only time will tell, but I wouldn't chance it. </p>
<p>This Galaxy Watch 6 Classic comes in black with a hybrid leather band, and this deal is for the Bluetooth-only version of the watch. If that's not a problem for you, then $120 off might be worth considering.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C791819Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b7445f52-ea12-4463-8225-f1d71bbb9b66" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for something affordable and don&apos;t mind going with a last-generation option; you like the Classic&apos;s physical rotating bezel; you want a watch with multiple promised upgrades.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather upgrade to a Watch 7, Watch 6 Classic with Bluetooth and LTE, or would prefer other colors and band types; you&apos;re looking for a current-gen watch option or something with dual-band GPS; you want a lightweight smartwatch.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and the regular Watch 6 were our former picks for the best Android watch, and they remain our favorite option as far as earlier builds go. For one, we loved the reintroduction of the physical rotating bezel on the Classics, and you can get them at a wide range of price points depending on what specific features you&apos;re looking for.</p><p>The only real downsides of this deal are that, at this price, you&apos;re looking at the Bluetooth-only option, and this specific deal is only for the Hybrid Leather T band option in all black. If you&apos;d rather go with other options, you can still flip around Amazon&apos;s other colors and configurations of the Watch 6 Classic to see what other discounts are available.</p>

<ul><li>Following the Ear (Open) launch, Nothing OS 3.0 was detailed in a highlight video alongside CEO Carl Pei.</li><li>The OS 3.0 update packs a revamp to the UI's typography, a complete lock screen overhaul with customization options, and AI sneaks it.</li><li>Nothing OS 3.0 is set to begin its beta in October with the company expecting to hit "general release" by December.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s recent product launch is cool, but the company also detailed what&apos;s next for its major OS release.</p><p>Nothing took viewers through a guided tour of OS 3.0 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3Ch2lEr9Q&t=350s&ab_channel=Nothing">YouTube video</a> featuring CEO Carl Pei following the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Ear (Open)</a>. Initially, the company stated the next software iteration would take its animations up a step to improve the user experience. Users can expect smoother transitions/animations for the lock screen, Quick Settings, and the home screen.</p><p>The lock screen is the next area of improvement for Nothing OS 3.0. The opening display is said to undergo a major rework that lets users "edit things in a very direct way." Long-pressing the lock screen brings up its customization menu. Nothing states that users can edit the clock face, which features pre-existing options like N-Style, N-Dot, and more.</p><p>The widget space includes a new "expand area" option. The on-device description states users can expand this space to "hide the main clock face."</p><p>The Quick Settings menu offers even more customization options. Nothing says users can quickly add or remove icons and expand them if desired. AI enters Nothing OS 3.0 to assist with app discovery alongside "Shared Widgets," which is described as a "portal" between you and a friend&apos;s phone.</p><p>The new Nothing Gallery and how AI will affect it were also detailed in the highlight video. Fear not as Nothing states users can expect the OS 3.0 beta to kick off in October. The company expects to hit "general release" by December.</p>

<p>Nothing OS 3.0 is expected to rock Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> software beneath the bells and whistles. AI is also expected after the company&apos;s CEO Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1798369533889302576">teased more of it</a> for its OS earlier this year. Pei posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) in June where he talked about the "hype" surrounding AI and that Nothing OS would adopt more of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the company&apos;s newfound interest in artificial intelligence comes at the price of the Phone 3. The net flagship device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">will not arrive in 2024</a>, but will instead fall back to 2025 where AI will be at its heart. Pei stated the company will take time to hone its AI so that it arrives in a useful manner.</p><p>The Nothing OS 3.0 highlight video gave us a taste of what&apos;s coming for the major update, but there&apos;s undoubtedly more to unpack.</p><p>Stealing our sights (other than software) is the Nothing Ear (Open). These are the brand&apos;s first open-ear style buds that deliver powerful bass and excellent call quality. The device&apos;s form factor might appeal to those with a more active lifestyle who enjoy running or biking. There&apos;s even a bit of ChatGPT integration if you need AI assistance.</p>

<hr>
<p>What&apos;s next for Roku is another Ultra-level streaming box with upgrades on speed and performance.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Roku Ultra 2024 debuts as the next step up from previous versions. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roku.com/blog/new-roku-ultra">press release</a>, Roku states its new Ultra streaming box resulted from customer feedback over the past few years. As such, the 2024 Ultra features a more powerful CPU that boosts its speed by 30% over the company&apos;s other models.</p><p>HDMI 2.1 aids the Roku Ultra in "seamless transitions" between sources, thanks to QMS (Quick Media Switching). Additionally, the box supports 4K, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos.</p><p>The Roku Ultra also picks up Wi-Fi 6 connectivity for improved connectivity, although we would&apos;ve liked to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wi-fi-6e-faq-what-biggest-upgrade-wi-fi-decade-means-you">Wi-Fi 6E</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>. Still, this support helps the box with faster Wi-Fi performance compared to the previous model, with better handling of "congested networks." However, the option to pop in an ethernet cable is still there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2997px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="K6BNZbVSwiUbtVAAnRxdAG" name="roku-ultra-remote-pro-second-edition.jpg" alt="The new Voice Remote Pro, 2nd edition." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6BNZbVSwiUbtVAAnRxdAG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2997" height="1686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roku)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The remote for the 2024 Roku Ultra features a new "Guide" button, which lets users access Roku&apos;s extensive list of Live TV channels for free content. The company also highlights a Quick Launch button that allows users to jump into their "favorite" shortcuts, such as apps, voice commands, or captions.</p><p>Other aspects of the Remote Pro you&apos;ve become accustomed to, like the hands-free voice option, lost remote feature, rechargeability via USB-C, and more, appear once more.</p><p>Another notable feature is the integration of Roku Ultra with your smart home devices. The post says users can receive doorbell notifications via the Roku Doorbell Camera. Of course, there is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-smart-home-introduces-an-array-of-cameras-lights-and-plugs">assortment of smart home devices</a> straight from Roku&apos;s kitchen that you can grab and pair seamlessly. Elsewhere, Roku is bringing its "Headphone mode" to wireless users. The company states users can now pair a device and listen to their content via Bluetooth.</p><p>The Roku Ultra (2024) is available today (Sept 24) in the U.S. for $99. Consumers in Canada can also find it today; however, the company adds that other major retailers will place it on the shelves "in the coming weeks."</p>

<p>If you&apos;re not grabbing the latest Roku Ultra, don&apos;t worry. The company also detailed a major OS update during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roku.com/blog/os-14" target="_blank">its Developer Summit</a>. Roku OS 14 kicks off with a new "Kinds & Family Zone." This library is said to contain a plethora of content, reaching 50,000 titles pulled from popular streaming apps and platforms. Focusing on your children, the new zone delivers suggestions for movies based on age, genre, and series.</p><p>Voice commands are being upgraded to work for more sources <em>other than</em> searching for shows. Roku states your remote will soon understand commands for accessing your settings. The company gave the example of saying "customize my home screen" as a command one could give the streaming box. Roku Voice is also said to work for wallpapers, system language, guest mode, and more.</p><p>The Roku Mobile app sneaks into this OS update. The "remote overlay" lets users access trending content quickly with this update. Roku states users will soon find the overlay at the bottom of their digital remote, and interacting with it will showcase personalized recommendations, categories, shortcuts for apps, and more.</p><p>IMDb ratings are also finding their way onto the app, just in case you&apos;re looking to dive a little deeper.</p><p>While Roku highlights OS 14 today, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.roku.com/article/228844467#section-2">release notes</a> state it will hit streaming boxes and TV models "in the coming months."</p>

<p>X (formerly Twitter) is overhauling how the block feature works, with Elon Musk confirming that all public content will be viewable, even if you&apos;ve blocked someone, which could totally change how privacy and interactions work on the platform.</p><p>Independent app researcher Nima Owji was the first to spill the news about X/Twitter&apos;s upcoming block feature update.

The block function will block that account from engaging with, but not block seeing, public post.<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1838285460440862861">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>An insider at X told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24252438/x-blocked-users-view-public-posts" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that the upcoming block feature update is aimed at closing a loophole where users could bypass blocks by switching to another account. This flaw let people still view and interact with content from accounts that had blocked them.</p><p>The news about X&apos;s block feature change has sparked a lot of buzz and speculation. Some think it’s a move to ensure everyone still sees ads, while others worry it could make handling harassment on the platform even harder.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With respect, I think this is a bad idea. There are many reasons somebody may not want certain individuals from easily seeing all their public posts. There are some REALLY bad actors on social media, sadly.<a href="https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1838334316520312989">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>That&apos;s because while blocked users on the platform can’t engage with your posts, they’ll still get to lurk and watch. Unsurprisingly, people aren’t thrilled and are already saying this could just make harassment easier.</p><p>So far, X hasn’t fully ditched the block feature, but it keeps changing how it works. In May, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/XEng/status/1786144517521097013" target="_blank">revealed</a> that if someone you’ve blocked replies to your post, you’ll still be able to see that reply. X said this change was essential to keep the block feature in line with its goal of being an open platform.</p><p>Musk hasn’t held back on his dislike for the block feature. Last year, he tweeted that blocking people “makes no sense” and suggested muting instead. Then, in August, he even hinted that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/elon-musk-announces-block-feature-removal">the block option might be getting the axe altogether</a>.</p><p>By backtracking on its earlier promise to completely scrap the block feature and instead allowing it to still limit engagement, X is trying to play it safe. This shift aims to cut down on the stalking and harassment that would probably explode if it just got rid of blocking entirely.</p>

<p>With the iPhone 16 Pro, you get a great phone that measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.3mm and weighs 199g. It has a glass front and rear but a titanium frame that is more durable than the Pixel&apos;s aluminum build.</p><p>The latest iPhone&apos;s bezels are thinner, making it easier to use with one hand. Apple states that this model&apos;s Ceramic Shield display is 50% tougher, which gives your iPhone the drop protection you look for in a phone. The iPhone 16 Pro is available in White, Black, Natural, and Desert Titanium.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro&apos;s camera layout is bigger than the Pixel, with two cameras stacked on top and a third on the side. This year&apos;s iPhone is also waterproof and dustproof with an IP68 rating, meaning it can withstand submersion in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes without damaging it.</p><p>On the other hand, the Google Pixel 9 Pro has a weaker aluminum frame but a fancy design that&apos;s just as nice to look at as the iPhone&apos;s. The Pixel is flat all around, and the new island-style visor on the back of the camera gives it a futuristic look. The latest Pixel dimensions are 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm, and it weighs the same as the iPhone 16 Pro at 199g.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro has a glass front with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for additional protection. The phone matches the iPhone&apos;s robust IP68 rating, so it can withstand submersion in 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes and remain unharmed. The Pixel 9 Pro is available in Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, and Obsidian.</p>

<p>Apple gave the iPhone 16 Pro a 6.3-inch LTPO Super Retina display with a maximum brightness of 2,000 nits. The iPhone also offers Dolby Vision, a 1,206 x 2,622 display, and a 460ppi pixel density. There is not much difference in display specs compared to previous models, but Apple made it possible for users to dim the iPhone&apos;s display to one nit this time, which is very useful in dark environments.</p><p>The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, an Always-On mode, and ProMotion technology. The phone also has fantastic touch response, and thanks to HDR10, you get great colors and contrast.</p><p>With the Google Pixel 9 Pro, you get a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED display with a snappy 120Hz refresh. The Pixel one-ups the iPhone 16 Pro with HDR10+ over Apple&apos;s HDR10. The display has a 1280 x 2856 resolution and a 495ppi pixel density, which gives the Pixel a sharper image than the iPhone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro has a higher peak brightness than the iPhone, going up to 3,000 nits. This makes it easier to look at your phone outdoors. As always, the Always-On display lets you see the time, notifications, and more even when the screen is locked.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro has fantastic specs to flaunt, with a powerful A18 Pro chipset and 8GB of RAM. You can choose from different storage options, such as 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. Its 48MP wide, 12MP telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide cameras can take great pictures that you can later share on social media without any compression. However, the iPhone&apos;s 12MP selfie camera loses out against the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>You can use the iPhone 16 Pro&apos;s Camera Control option to get direct access to the camera and snap a photo with an additional button press. You can also zoom in and out by sliding your finger back and forth on the button. The iPhone 16 Pro supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 25W and Qi2 wireless charging up to 15W. While it falls short in battery size with a 3,582mAh cell, you can make it last by using features such as Low Power Mode.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro has a bigger 4,700mAh battery and faster charging speeds. It delivers 27W wired, 21W wireless, and 5W reverse wireless charging. The Tensor G4 processor does not match the iPhone&apos;s chipset but still provides a great user experience and AI-heavy features. Happily, Google has finally resolved the heating issues that have tormented the Tensor-powered phones. With the latest Pixel, you can choose from 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options, matching the iPhone&apos;s options. You also get double the RAM with the Pixel, toppling the iPhone&apos;s 8GB RAM with a whopping 16GB RAM instead.</p><p>Camera quality is where the Pixel always shines, and the 9 Pro&apos;s 50MP wide, 48MP telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide cameras can take fantastic pictures. Like the iPhone, you can record in 4K, but you get a vastly better 42MP selfie camera.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll see a huge difference in software in the iPhone 16 Pro versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro. Naturally, the iPhone runs iOS whereas the Pixel runs Android out of the box. Google has its own style, as does Apple, and you can choose the one that&apos;s more appealing based on your personal preferences.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro launched with iOS 18 on which you can dramatically customize the lock screen, home screen, and Control Center. You can change the lock screen&apos;s fonts, colors, and more to give it a personal touch. iOS 18 also has RCS support, making it easier to message your Android friends. The latest iPhone, featuring Apple Intelligence, has new creative capabilities. For example, Camera Control gives you faster access to visual intelligence and lets you easily interact with the advanced camera system. You can expect between five to seven years of software updates, based on Apple&apos;s support history.</p><p>There are tons of software goodies you can enjoy, but to mention one more, you have access to Writing Tools where you can adjust emails or notes to be more concise and friendly and give them a more professional tone. In Phone and Notes apps, you can also transcribe, record, and summarize audio. If you&apos;ve used a Pixel before, a lot of this might sound very familiar. That&apos;s because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18 stole a lot of features from Android</a>.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro comes with Android 14 out of the box, and Google promises seven years of software updates. The latest Pixel also has new AI features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google" target="_blank">Add Me</a>, that are exclusive to the Pixel 9 series. Google offers clean software with zero bloatware, and the Material You interface is customizable and colorful.</p><p>The most exciting feature of the Pixel 9 Pro is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, an app where you can create images using generative AI. The new widgets give you a summary of the weather so you know whether to take an umbrella with you. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> are very helpful in organizing screenshots and making them searchable.

<p>As you can see in the iPhone 16 Pro vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro showdown, both have phones much to offer. Which one you choose comes down to what features matter most to you. The iPhone 16 Pro has a more powerful chipset, but the Pixel 9 Pro has a better selfie cam and superior AI features, among other things. You won&apos;t get all the features promised on the iPhone from day one, which is something else to consider. Both phones start at $999 for the 128GB variant, so the price isn&apos;t a tiebreaker.</p><p>Some users may like Apple&apos;s style, while others might prefer Google&apos;s layout and the flexibility of Android. You may find more app options on the Play Store than Apple App Store.

<p>I had been fiddling with the idea of replacing my Android TV with a projector for a while before I bit the bullet. It was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/if-i-buy-only-one-thing-this-prime-day-it-will-be-this">one thing I wanted to buy last Prime Day</a> because I felt it would be the perfect substitute for a smart TV.</p><p>Of course, a projector cannot get as bright and crisp as a real television set, so you might be curious about my conviction to go forth with this plan. My bedroom is insanely small. There are boxes full of stuff everywhere, and I cannot even fit a full-blown wardrobe or a proper dressing table in there.</p><p>Thus, putting a TV in such a small room was out of the question. But at one point, streaming my favorite shows before bedtime on my smartphone just wasn&apos;t cutting it. I toyed with the idea of a wall-mounted screen, but that would further shrink my already tiny bedroom.</p>

<p>There are other limitations of a projector as well. It needs to be mounted on a mount or a stand; most of them need to be plugged in to function, and cheap ones don&apos;t come with Google TV or Android TV.</p><p>The first two issues were significant for my small room conundrum. I had to configure the room&apos;s furniture arrangement and determine whether such a setup would be less untidy and occupy less space as opposed to a regular old wall-mounted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV</a>.</p><p>After considering everything, I decided to get the XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro for my experiment. XGIMI provided a sample to help me test this idea. This affordable little projector has a built-in stand that swivels at an angle. As for the height-adjustable stand, I got a cheap off-brand one online.</p>

<p>Had I bought the projector with my own money, the entire setup would still have cost me almost exactly $500. That&apos;s filthy cheap, especially considering that the MoGo 3 Pro can project screen sizes as big as <strong>120 inches</strong>! That&apos;s big enough to cover a significant portion of my bedroom wall.</p><p>To make the most of the experience, I decided to place the projector right next to my bed, sandwiched between my bedside table and the bed. Conveniently, there&apos;s an electrical socket in that vicinity where I have my multiport USB-C charger plugged in. The swiveling design of the MoGo 3 Pro really came in handy here because I didn&apos;t need to twist and turn or readjust the stand itself once it was planted in its spot.</p>

<p>The XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro has auto keystone correction with a dedicated button for this on the remote control. The remote itself is like any other smart Android TV remote; you can use Google Assistant to look up stuff and use the Netflix, YouTube, or Amazon Prime buttons to quickly open those apps. And what&apos;s even cooler is there&apos;s an extra unlabeled shortcut button that is completely customizable. I have mine set to Disney Plus, but you can choose any app you like.</p><p>The picture quality is really good too, delivering a 1080p resolution. The brightness is improved with this iteration, going from 400 lumens on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">MoGo 2 Pro</a> to 450 lumens on the MoGo 3 Pro. It&apos;s not a major improvement, but it is certainly noticeable. Overall, I felt satisfied with the image output. It&apos;s ideal for nighttime streaming and binge watching my favorite anime series.</p>

<p>I cannot express how quick and easy it was to have the whole thing up and running. Since I have tested the last-gen MoGo 2 Pro, I felt a markedly improved experience with the auto keystone correction. It is so easy and you don&apos;t have to be a tech expert to set it up.</p><p>I&apos;d probably struggle to get the angle right with any other projector because of the awkward lack of space in my room. During this experiment, I had flashbacks of the Anker Nebula projector that I reviewed a few years back. It was a nightmare to get the keystone right on it in tight spaces and small rooms.</p><p>The circular lens and swiveling stand make a world of difference. In the end, I concluded my experiment was a glowing success. I am now spoiled with a 120-inch screen plastered adjacent to my bed at a perfect viewing angle. Sometimes, I&apos;ll cast some Reels on the gigantic screen, just because. The XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector truly replaced my need for an Android TV, and there&apos;s no going back now.</p><p>So, if you don&apos;t have space in your flat or room, give this hack a try!</p>

They analyze your fitness level and help you improve your pace (speed) or endurance (how long you can run) over time by suggesting workouts.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> comes with six months of Fitbit Premium, you can use this run coaching to improve, then save and update your favorite workouts if you decide not to keep the subscription. Plus, you have other tools like Cardio Load and Daily Readiness that, while not specific to running, will still help you improve.</p><p>Here&apos;s everything you need to know about run coaching on the Pixel Watch 3!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-google-pixel-watch-3-run-coaching-2">How to enable Google Pixel Watch 3 run coaching</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SHciSG6pzyGTQp6VnYhaMg" name="fitbit-running-coach-setup.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing how to set up Fitbit Premium run coaching." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SHciSG6pzyGTQp6VnYhaMg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, you need Fitbit Premium to access Pixel Watch 3 run coaching. You should be offered a six-month free trial during the initial Watch 3 setup process unless you already have an active subscription. With Premium enabled, this feature should only take a minute to set up.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Fitbit app</strong>, then the <strong>Coach tab</strong>.</p><p>2. You should see a banner that reads "Get personalized workouts tailored to your readiness, goals, and recent workouts." Tap <strong>Get started</strong>. If you don&apos;t see this banner, look for the <strong>Today&apos;s run</strong> section.</p><p>3. Choose whether you&apos;re a <strong>Beginner</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, or <strong>Advanced </strong>runner. Intermediate runners can regularly run at least 3.1 miles or 5 kilometers. Advanced runners either "run competitively" or "follow a specific running plan." Since that&apos;s a bit vague, I&apos;d suggest anyone who regularly runs 10Ks or half marathons would be advanced by Google&apos;s metric.</p><p>4. Choose whether you want your AI coaching to focus on improving <strong>pace</strong>, <strong>endurance</strong>, or a <strong>balanced</strong> approach (aka both).</p><p>You&apos;ll now have daily AI recommendations sent to you! If you end up reconsidering your choices, go to the Coach tab and tap <strong>See all</strong> next to <strong>Today&apos;s run</strong>, then the <strong>top-right ellipsis</strong> and <strong>update preferences</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HjgvAmutoj6D2tSogkeKYg" name="fitbit-running-coach-generated-workout.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing auto-generated workouts and the option to edit them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HjgvAmutoj6D2tSogkeKYg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once Pixel Watch 3 run coaching is enabled, you&apos;ll see a daily run in the Coach view. Specifically, you&apos;ll see <em>four</em> run options, typically an easy run, tempo run, tempo intervals, or sprint intervals in our early testing. Although Fitbit will highlight one top rec, you can choose another if you&apos;d prefer something harder or easier.</p><p>Tap on any workout, and Fitbit will summarize why this run will benefit your training; plus, once you&apos;ve started running consistently, it&apos;ll begin incorporating data on your recent runs to explain why you should do this workout next. For example, it might tell you that you&apos;ve done plenty of moderate-zone runs, so a tempo run will improve endurance at a higher heart rate.</p><p>Your quickest option is to tap <strong>Start on watch</strong>; within seconds, the workout will appear on your wrist, so you must simply wait until the GPS connects and tap the <strong>Start button</strong>. It&apos;s a temporary workout that won&apos;t be saved to your workouts list.</p><p>However, you may also want to tap <strong>Customize run</strong>, which creates an individualized copy that <em>does</em> save to your permanent workouts. You can tap on any interval to change the duration, heart rate zone, or even the goal itself to something else like Distance or Calories burned. You can also delete or rearrange the intervals, and then create your own from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="other-running-tools-on-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Other running tools on the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-and-Android-statue.jpeg" alt="An Android statue wearing a headband and a dummy Pixel Watch 3, standing behind a display of Pixel Watch 3s." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI run coaching is exclusive to Fitbit Premium. You can even find some run-themed audio guides among the workouts. But other Fitbit tools for the Pixel Watch 3 will benefit runners <em>and</em> won&apos;t cost anything extra.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a> tracks your overall workout load from runs, cross-training, and everyday activities that elevate your heart rate, and then tells you if you&apos;re working out more or less than in previous weeks.</p><p>During my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3 review</a>, I tested out Cardio Load and found that it "puts more stock on a workout&apos;s length than its intensity," giving more training load than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> for a long hike but less for an intense anaerobic track workout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW" name="google-pixel-watch-3-readiness-score.jpg" alt="Morning Brief Readiness Score on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, if you sleep wearing your Pixel Watch 3 for at least a week, you&apos;ll start receiving Daily Readiness scores that judge your sleep quality, resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and recent workouts and score your readiness to tackle future workouts from 1–100.</p><p>With both Cardio Load and Daily Readiness, Fitbit extrapolates your Target Load, or the amount of activity you should aim to hit based on your readiness and past Cardio Load scores. Your AI-recommended runs will be tailored to hit your Target Load, but if you&apos;re not subscribed to Premium, you can look at past workout loads and then create your own workout to try and hit that score.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 has surprisingly strong battery life, revamped heart rate for high-intensity workouts, and running tools like buildable workouts, Cardio Load, post-run form analysis, and AI-developed workouts.

<hr>
<p>Marshall is rolling out a new set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> today called the Monitor III. These headphones are hitting store shelves in various regions, including the U.S., and they follow up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/marshall-monitor-ii-anc-review">Monitor II ANC headphones</a> that debuted last February.</p><p>The Monitor III headphones keep the same design vibe as their predecessor, featuring a sleek leather finish, a foldable design, and the iconic ANC button or control knob.</p>

<p>Marshall says the Monitor III will greatly extend playtime with ANC on, offering up to 70 hours and 100 hours without it. For comparison, the previous model provided up to 30 hours with ANC and 45 hours without.</p><p>The Monitor III&apos;s Active Noise Cancellation is also getting a nifty upgrade. They’ll now constantly monitor ambient noise to keep unwanted sounds at bay. Plus, they feature a new adaptive loudness option that tweaks audio to fit the surrounding noise levels. Users can also take advantage of the Dynamic Loudness feature, letting them fine-tune the treble, mids, and bass at any volume.</p>
<p>Marshall is adding a Soundstage Spatial Audio feature to the Monitor III, which promises to give users a more immersive experience. The headphones also come with a customizable M-button, allowing users to tweak their EQ settings and control Spotify or their favorite voice assistant. </p><p>Further, these headphones are Bluetooth LE audio ready, which means they support Auracast, which has so much potential, according to Android Central Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">recently had a chance to test it out</a>. </p><p>The company notes that these advanced features help the Monitor III stand out from the competition, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/sony-wh-1000xm5-launch">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> and the most recent Apple AirPods Max. While those models provide up to 50 hours of playtime with ANC, Marshall claims the Monitor III already has the upper hand in that department.</p>

<p>For those curious about the Monitor III&apos;s technical aspects, it weighs around 250 grams and is equipped with 32mm drivers with 35Ω driver impedance and a frequency response ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. </p><p>While 70 hours is the promised playtime, the headphones take about two and a half hours to charge fully through USB Type-C. Also, alongside the foldable design, they come in a premium-looking hard case that is easy to carry around. </p><p>The Marshall Monitor III headphones will retail for $359 in the U.S., available on the company’s website and at various retail stores. In other regions, they’re priced at €349 in the EU and £299 in the UK.</p>

<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">testing quite a few open-ear earbuds</a>, I&apos;ll begin by making a case for why this is the Editor’s Choice by starting... with the case. While not the smallest earbud case on the market, it is one of the smaller cases when you look at offerings from the open-ear competition. Nothing again places its signature colored dots on the inside to make putting the earpieces in their cradles a cinch. The lid is clear with a metal hinge and another metal embellishment where the case opens. </p><p>Sitting inside, the buds and the entire package look almost like a jeweler’s display. Though thin and easily pocketable, the case is tall. Although it will fit in your pocket, depending on how tall you and your pockets are, it also might be sticking up and out of your pocket.</p>

<p>Being open-ear earbuds, they don’t sit inside your ear canal, and I’ve worn them for hours at a time to test their comfort. The result was no fatigue, to the point that you’d almost forget that you’re wearing earbuds. The soft-touch silicone material the ear hooks are made of, along with the position of the battery and angling of the transducer, combine like Voltron to form a giant robot that protects your wearing comfort. It&apos;s good that battery life holds up to my extended periods of wear and meets Nothing&apos;s claim of eight hours on a charge. You may get a little more juice if your listening volume is low the majority of your time wearing them.</p><p>Let’s get to what you came here for, though! Sound quality. I listened to various genres of music at low volumes and higher volumes. I listened in quiet rooms and on noisy urban streets. I listened to movies and anime. Nothing Ear (Open) are the closest I’ve come to experiencing an open design that sounds like traditional earbuds that sit in your ear canal. For the first time in an open-ear review, I can say that bass lovers will thoroughly enjoy this experience, but that is not to the exclusion of those who love acoustic music. The musicality and stereo imaging are just as enjoyable.</p><p>The haunting, ethereal vocals are beautifully reproduced when listening to “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” OST. The soundstage is diminished at low volumes, but turning the volume up increases that soundstage, adding the ethereal back to the experience.</p><p>Jazz is jumpin’ like your favorite juke joint! Ok, so you may not have a favorite “juke joint” in this day and age (Google it), but you have clarity, discreet instrumentation, warm upright bass reproduction, beautiful horn sections, and, ultimately, immersion.</p><p>Sylosis&apos;s “Poison for the Lost” is a counterpoint to The Roots “Do You Want More????” The former is a death metal track heavy on guitar and with guttural vocals. The latter is a bass-heavy hip-hop track with some high-frequency instrumentation, thanks to the addition of bagpipes in the mix. </p>

<p>For low-volume listening, you’re likely going to want two different EQ settings, and that’s another area where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">many of Nothing’s audio offerings shine</a>. With the Ear (open), you get Nothing’s full slate of EQ offerings between their simple and advanced EQ settings. </p><p>The simple settings, complete with the ability to customize what is essentially a 3-band EQ, will be enough for most listeners, especially considering these are open earbuds. But if you feel like it makes a difference, you can hit Nothing’s proper parametric EQ in the advanced tab and play with gain, bandwidth, and Q-factor to your heart’s content. I’d recommend playing with the simple settings at the very least because it will make a difference in sound quality at low volumes when listening to podcasts or anything vocal-focused.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the Ear (open) that I appreciate is the ChatGPT integration. The first earbuds to do so. It’s great, and it’s incredibly useful when researching things on the go or talking through a plan or idea, but it’s not perfect. A brief example of the good, the bad, and the ugly is this:</p><p>To test it out, I queried ChatGPT about the best fancy restaurants in Malibu, California, to eat at. This beautiful city is on the famous Pacific Coast Highway that runs along the Southern California coastline. ChatGPT gave me brilliant advice, along with context on why, for a few different restaurants, but that’s where the utility ends. I couldn’t ask it to call the restaurants for me or to give me driving directions tied into Google Maps and then take me there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yk9aP6Df6zHu28Cc5p7ugV" name="nothing-ear-open-case-red-dot.JPG" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yk9aP6Df6zHu28Cc5p7ugV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A little feature that some folk may not consider rounds out the list of things I like. The case, like the buds themselves, is IP54-rated for dust and water ingress. Since these are meant for use cases where people may be outside during inclement weather, that’s a reassuring feature. However, this rating means that you can’t wear them during heavy rains, so in the next iteration, I’d like to see an IP65 rating, which would allow these to be worn during more challenging climate conditions.</p>

<p>One last note on the things I like: call quality is <em><strong>very good. </strong></em>I recorded microphone audio when I had them connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> and asked callers how I sounded during calls. In both instances, audio quality was Nothing to sneeze at.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kGXV6MmznttPyXUpR9SZCa" name="nothing-ear-open-earbud-cu.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kGXV6MmznttPyXUpR9SZCa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn’t a lot to dislike here! At all. A couple of standout items would be the lack of wireless charging for the case and the case length. Both issues are pretty standard in the open-ear market segment, though.</p><p>With that said, while there isn’t much I dislike, there are two things I’d like to see in a second-generation version of these fantastic earbuds: wireless charging for the case and Hi-Res Wireless audio support. Not necessarily to make the music “better,” but since they <em>are</em> open-ear, having every bit of dynamic range I can get so that I can get every ounce of audio data and frequency out of these earbuds as possible would be great!</p><p>I’d also like to see Google Assistant integration. Once I research restaurants while I’m out with my beautiful wife and we decide on one, I need to hand it off to Google Assistant for whatever next steps: creating a note, driving directions, setting a reminder, you get the idea.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YGm6jxQfS5m9NK4ew9sQPX" name="nothing-ear-open-bluetooth-settings.JPG" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGm6jxQfS5m9NK4ew9sQPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last, though the ChatGPT integration is awesome, I need that functionality to do more. For example, I’d like the ability to configure each earbud independently to use whatever digital assistant you want. Currently, you can only set Google Assistant or ChatGPT as your assistant. Once you set the pinch command on either earbud, that setting is ubiquitous across both earbuds, despite the fact that you can customize the other functions independently for either earbud.</p><p>And I’m being nitpicky here, but I’d like them in a color other than white so that they won’t look grimy as quickly as these may. Time will tell, but with white buds and a white case, this is a concern of mine.</p>

<p>There are a few others in this market segment, but they have a lot to live up to because, at $150, Nothing makes an excellent value proposition with its quality and feature set. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open</a> and BeyerDynamic Verio 200 both compete on sound quality and features, but they are at a premium. The former costs twice as much, $300, while the latter is $70 more at $220.</p><p>You can get close to the Nothing Ear (open) in price with Shokz OpenFit and 1More Fit products, but I think the Ear (Open) has them beat in sound quality and options. </p>

These alone make the Ear (Open) very easy to recommend for those hunting for a solid pair of open earbuds.</p>
