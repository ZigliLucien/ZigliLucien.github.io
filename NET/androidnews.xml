This year, we got much more than just foldables, with Samsung breaking into a new wearable category with its first smart ring and some new Galaxy AI tricks for its devices.</p><p>In case you somehow missed the big news this week, worry not. Here&apos;s everything Samsung announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024-live-blog-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-z-fold-6-flip-6-and-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, from foldables to its new Apple AirPod-like earbuds.</p>
<h2 id="galaxy-z-fold-6-and-flip-6-2">Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QN85g8fzg98oeUSwRzFWFK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-display-corners.jpg" alt="The bright display and square corners of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QN85g8fzg98oeUSwRzFWFK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Among the biggest device to launch during unpacked are the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6. The changes to these devices are fairly iterative, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 received a welcome change to the design that should help make it more palatable for consumers.</p><p>As pointed out in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6 hands-on</a>, the phone is now wider with a much squarer design. This should make the larger external display easier to use while bringing the internal folding display more in line with other foldable phones. The phone is also thinner thanks to some internal improvements, which should appease some fans.</p><p>The camera system is largely unchanged except for the ultrawide, which uses the same 12MP resolution but apparently uses a new sensor for better low-light performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3EYFwuprUs7PqrG6M32Nif" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-flex.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 main display folded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3EYFwuprUs7PqrG6M32Nif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Flip has fewer design changes, but there are a few notable upgrades. As noted in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6 hands-on</a>, the device has a flatter frame and a dash of color around the cameras. The phone also has a new 50MP primary camera, which should provide better image output, especially in low light, and the 4,000mAh battery should help it last longer before reaching for a charger.</p><p>The cover screen hasn&apos;t changed much, but some new software additions bring more widgets and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> to the external display.</p>
<p>Both phones are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and come with One UI 6.1.1 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, which brings more Galaxy AI features to the phones, like an improved Interpreter mode, Drawing Assist, new wallpaper features, and more.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-preorder-deals">available now</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-preorder-deals">for preorder</a> and start at $1899 and $1099, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="galaxy-watch-7-and-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-apps-grid.jpg" alt="Apps on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> may look familiar, but it&apos;s the inside that counts, and Samsung has upgraded the watch with its latest 3nm chip for improved performance, plus a revamped BioActive sensor that should make it more accurate. The watch runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, has double the storage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, comes with Galaxy AI features like suggested replies, and is capable of detecting sleep apnea, a disorder that disrupts breathing during sleep.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="49YV3dTADr9ir4Rwp5TdKR" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-watch-ultra-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/49YV3dTADr9ir4Rwp5TdKR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the real news is the Galaxy Watch Ultra, which takes things to another level. The watch has a large, rugged design and battery life that lasts up to 100 hours in power-saving mode or 48 hours in exercise power-saving mode. There&apos;s also a new Quick Button on the side that you can program to open and begin various functions like workouts or a stopwatch. This is in addition to the improved sensors, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature">sleep apnea detection</a>, new chipset, and more.</p><p>If it seems a little familiar, it&apos;s because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> also has an Action button that does more or less the same thing. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra hands-on</a>, we point out the similarities between this and Apple&apos;s offering, although Samsung manages to undercut Apple by a bit and still offers a circular display.</p><p>The Watch 7 and Watch Ultra are available for preorder and retail for $299 and $649, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Samsung Galaxy Ring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otewimivudHS4cLxUTXFdL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-and-black-01.jpg" alt="The black and gold Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otewimivudHS4cLxUTXFdL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> took off and started a trend of emerging smart rings from a bevy of smaller companies, Samsung decided to jump into the ring (pun very much intended) with its own. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> is capable of tracking one&apos;s sleep, vitals, and workouts while feeding all this information to the new Galaxy AI-powered Samsung Health, giving users insights into their wellness and offering ways to improve and reach their goals.</p><p>Beyond that, the ring also has some gesture controls for Galaxy smartphones. For example, users can take photos or silence alarms by pinching twice, something you won&apos;t find on other smart rings.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring hands-on</a>, we note that the ring feels quite thin and light compared to its competitors. It also has the backing of an entire ecosystem, which could give Oura a run for its money as the smart ring category heats up.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring comes in nine different sizes and three different finishes and lasts up to a week with a single charge. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-preorder-deals">available for preorder</a> and retails for $399 with no subscription.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-buds-3-and-3-pro-2">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RstMRJKVa8UK2UGF2PBXGM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-3-vs-pro-close-05.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RstMRJKVa8UK2UGF2PBXGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy <del>AirPods</del> Buds 3 Pro are a complete redesign from previous iterations of Samsung earbuds. They offer a stem design similar to other wireless earbuds from Apple and others. Samsung differentiates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> by designing them with a light on the stem with a few functional indicators (or just to show off).</p><p>The earbuds have an in-ear design with improved audio, Adaptive EQ & Adaptive ANC, and higher voice bandwidth for calls. There are also some intelligent features like live translation with Interpreter mode and quick access to Bixby.</p><p>The regular Galaxy Buds have similar improvements but feature single drivers, no lights, no ambient sound, and fewer Galaxy AI features. They also have an open design for those of you who don&apos;t like in-ear buds, and they&apos;re cheaper at just $179. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro retail for $249.</p>

<p>In addition to announcements from Samsung, Google also took a moment to highlight some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-get-new-circle-to-search-features">Android and Wear OS-related updates</a> coming to Samsung&apos;s latest devices. This includes new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features for both foldables, access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and the ability to watch YouTube TV in multiview, allowing for multiple streams at the same time.</p><p>Google also highlighted Wear OS 5, which comes first to the Galaxy Watch series and brings improved performance and battery life, particularly when it comes to workouts.</p>

<p>The BlackPro Alpine Loop Nylon Band is a rugged number ready for rough use. You're going to be very happy with the gap-less fit and the One Click connector which is even easier to use compared to quick-release pins. The strap is easily adjustable thanks to its unique hook system.</p></p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/what-color-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-should-you-buy">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 comes in some unusual colors</a>, so picking the right band for it requires some thinking and digging around. Luckily, the smartwatch is compatible with straps for older Galaxy Watch models too, so you have an ocean of choice. While Cream and Silver variants of the Galaxy Watch 7 go with most bands out there, the Green variant is a little harder to match.</p><p>Barton&apos;s Quick Release Top Grain Leather Watch Band comes in millions of band colors, clasp colors, sizes, and thread styles. You can peruse through the brand&apos;s offerings knowing full well that every single band has a quick-release connector that fits the Galaxy Watch 7 and that the top grain leather is indeed as good as expected. The leather strap ages over time, giving each one a unique look. Be sure to select the 20mm option when checking out, because that&apos;s the one that fits the Watch 7.</p><p>For metal link bands, there&apos;s none above the admirable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-modern-fit-band-samsung-galaxy-watch-review">Spigen Modern Fit Samsung Galaxy Watch band</a>. This high-grade stainless steel band fits a wide range of Galaxy Watch models, including the Galaxy Watch 7. You get a tool to open links yourself and adjust the band&apos;s size to fit your wrist perfectly. The Spigen Modern Fit Samsung Galaxy Watch band comes in silver, black, and rose gold. It&apos;s surprisingly affordable for such a high quality watchband.</p><p>If you want a solid, colorful band for everyday use, a silicone or rubber band is ideal for this. Both Samsung and Ritche sell compelling bands that are comfortable and easy to swap out. The difference is in the connectors they use and the material. Samsung favors the One Click connector with rubber for the band whereas Ritche favors the universal quick-release connector with silicone for the strap. If you&apos;re not looking to spend too much, Ritche&apos;s Classic Silicone Watch Band is more affordable.</p><p>Want to browse some more?

But now, it&apos;s already time to start looking at the Galaxy Z Flip 7, especially for those who may want to wait another year before upgrading their phones. So, what can we expect from the <em>next</em> Samsung flip phone?</p><p>Since we don&apos;t expect the Galaxy Z Flip 7 to launch until the summer of 2025, it&apos;s too early for rumors and leaks. However, we can still speculate and discuss what we&apos;d like to see based on current trends and what we think we know. So, while we continue testing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, here are the things we want to see on the Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-what-we-know-so-far-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: What we know so far</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rYJpJ9JRYBa7gPqFCFkvdH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-1.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Galaxy Z Flip 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYJpJ9JRYBa7gPqFCFkvdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While we may not know anything about the design of the Galaxy Z Flip 7, we may already know what chips will power it. Qualcomm is set to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">next-generation Snapdragon chip</a> later this year, which will be the first to feature the company&apos;s new Oryon cores. These are found in Qualcomm&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon Elite</a> chips, powering new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/-microsoft-copilot-plus-faq">Copilot Plus PCs</a> and promise to bring incredible power and efficiency.</p><p>We don&apos;t know any specifics about the chip aside from the fact that Oryon will be present. However, we can guess that it will be a major leap in performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kh8dGGQbfRbLbXSwXYZGJa" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Gen-4-Oryon-teaser.jpg" alt="Qualcomm teasing Oryon cores for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kh8dGGQbfRbLbXSwXYZGJa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Samsung is working on its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency">next-gen Exynos chip</a>, which will likely be built on an improved 3nm process that could bring enhanced efficiency gains that may even outpace the next Snapdragon flagship processor. Samsung is also likely to lean heavily into AI processing to match offerings from both Qualcomm and Google.</p><p>Elsewhere, we can guess that 12GB of RAM will be standard since it&apos;s what&apos;s available on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and the battery will likely be at least 4,000mAh or higher.</p><p>We can&apos;t say for sure if Samsung will change the design, but the company has stuck with the rather square and angular design for the last few generations.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Android Central&apos;s wishlist for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 based on the specs and our limited hands-on time with the Z Flip 6:</p>
<p><strong>A larger, more functional cover screen</strong></p><p>Samsung made waves when it introduced the much larger cover screen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. This was the current trend, after all, with companies like Motorola and OPPO opting for larger external displays. However, compared to its closest competitors, like the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and even last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a>, the Z Flip 6 is still on the smaller side of flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Flip 7, I would love to see Samsung increase the size of the cover screen while also getting rid of the weird notch at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7imWmpTkmd8sCxGcyPyCB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-2024.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Motorola Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7imWmpTkmd8sCxGcyPyCB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4073" height="2291" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But even beyond that, I would like to see Samsung provide a better cover screen experience out of the box. Unlike the Razr series, Samsung still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">makes users go through hoops</a> to enable app use on the external display, with a limited number available via the Labs feature and more through accessible with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> module.</p><p>Samsung says it wants to focus on the widget experience by providing better functionality for quickly accessing certain apps without needing to dive into them, and that&apos;s fine, but we should be able to have it both ways.</p>
<p><strong>Less edge, more curves</strong></p><p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip 6 design. Its flat frame and back panels give the phone a very clean look, and the addition of the color-matching camera sensors is a nice touch. However, holding phones like this can actually hurt.</p><p>I realized this while reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>; the edge of the frame would dig into my fingers, making it very uncomfortable to hold the phone after some time. After my brief hands-on with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, I can tell this will likely be a problem here, too.</p><p>Motorola has taken a different approach with a curved frame, with back and cover panels that seamlessly curve into it. The result is a phone that&apos;s fairly comfortable to hold despite it being larger than the Z Flip 6. I&apos;m not saying Samsung should go completely curvy, but maybe a major design re-do is in order after we have largely gotten the same thing for the past few generations.</p>
<p><strong>Faster charging</strong></p><p>I&apos;m happy to see Samsung is finally giving the Galaxy Z Flip 6 a battery life boost with the new 4,000mAh battery. With the more efficient <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chip, this should help users achieve all-day battery life. However, as the battery becomes larger, the charging time will become slower since Samsung has kept the same 25W speed.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5 can take as much as an hour and a half to charge fully, and ain&apos;t nobody got time for that! Meanwhile, OPPO and Motorola&apos;s latest flip phones provide speeds of 44W and 45W, respectively, making it much less of a hassle to get a good amount of juice before heading out.</p><p>You&apos;ve already got one-half of the equation, Samsung, but the others are showing you up in a category you popularized!</p>
<p><strong>Bring back Bespoke</strong></p><p>One of the best things about flip phones is that they just look so nice. Even with cheaper models, flip phones are just surprisingly stylish phones, so it&apos;s no wonder why they capture a certain audience. I feel like Samsung really had something going when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-bespoke-edition">Bespoke Edition Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, allowing users to mix and match different color options beyond the standard offering.</p><p>Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which comes in some nice colors, hasn&apos;t been able to match this level of customizability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:719px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SbbH3w3SYXo8PTwNkKYL6j" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-bespoke-lifestyle-hero-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Lifestyle Hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SbbH3w3SYXo8PTwNkKYL6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="719" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors aren&apos;t exactly my favorite, as I&apos;m not a fan of pastels, but being able to mix it up with different options for the bottom panel, the frame/hinge, and the camera sensors would make the buying process so much more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Z Flip FE</strong></p><p>Now that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 costs $100 more than its predecessors, Samsung needs to consider giving us a cheaper model to launch alongside the "flagship." Similar to other Fan Edition models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-make-galaxy-z-flip-fe">Samsung should offer a Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> to appeal to consumers not willing to spend more and more on a new phone.</p><p>Motorola already does this by offering the Razr in Plus and non-Plus (lovingly called the Minus) models. In fact, the company upped its game by giving the cheaper model the same design as last year&apos;s flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>, which is quite a feat.</p>
<p>Samsung could do something similar, by giving the Galaxy Z Flip 7 a larger cover screen and "borrowing" the cover screen design from the Flip 5 or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review">Flip 4</a> for a cheaper foldable. And for good measure, Samsung should charge $799 for this phone, which is cheaper than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but still more than a the non-Plus Razr. </p>

<p>The new Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a more refined design and features the latest Snapdragon chip from Qualcomm, meaning you'll get the fastest speeds of any flip phone. You'll also get the latest GenAI features with Gemini and Galaxy AI, and the new 50MP camera will help you snap great photos.</p></p>

<p>There's one big difference between the ASUS CX34 Flip and CM34 Flip. The former is powered by an Intel Core i3 chip, while the latter makes use of AMD's Ryzen 3 7320C.

<h2 id="more-chromebook-brands-2">More Chromebook brands</h2>
<p>Of course, this list only features a few of the many excellent brands that sell Chromebooks. In addition to smartphones and wearables, Samsung makes quite a few impressive Chromebooks, while HP and Dell are known for selling their own powerful devices. Although it&apos;s a little hard to find on sale, HP also sells the HP Dragonfly Pro, a laptop that we selected as the "best premium pick" in our guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>. If that device happens to go on sale this Prime Day, we&apos;ll update this guide as quickly as possible. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon has confirmed that the 10th annual Prime Day sale event will run from July 16th through July 17th. </p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-find-the-best-deals-during-prime-day-2">How can I find the best deals during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>We&apos;ll be reporting all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">best Prime Day deals</a> for Android fans here on our site, but you can also find all sorts of deals by signing up for one of Amazon&apos;s newsletters. If you&apos;re unsure about the quality of an offer, we also suggest using a price history tracking tool like <strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong> to get some context before hitting that Add to Cart button. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-on-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop on Prime Day?</h2>
<p>For the most part, Prime Day is exclusive to subscribers. If you haven&apos;t become a member yet, we suggest signing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can enjoy all of the benefits of the sale for free. Alternatively, you can keep an eye on competitors&apos; sites — such as Best Buy or Walmart — to see if they&apos;re matching Amazon&apos;s prices.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-chromebook-2">How do I choose a Chromebook?</h2>
<p>There's always a ton of specs and features you typically need to juggle when shopping for a laptop, but for Chromebooks, the buyer's guide can be summed up pretty well into four points:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Get a touchscreen.</strong> — Unless you're anti-fun, there's no reason not to get a touchscreen model; they do not cost that much more and it's always worth it. Touchscreens make it easier to interact with Android apps as well as making it easier to do things like sign documents or zoom in precisely.<br></li><li><strong>4GB of RAM is good, 8GB is better.</strong> — Most Chromebooks sold today come with 4GB of RAM, and 4GB is perfectly fine for running a video call plus a dozen or so tabs in Chrome. More RAM is always better, but 4GB is fine. If it says it has 2GB of RAM — or 16GB of internal storage — close the tab and walk away.<br></li><li><em><strong>Check the expiration date!!!</strong></em> — Yes, Chromebooks come with expiration dates, after which they are no longer guaranteed to receive Chrome OS updates. It's called the AUE date, and they're listed for every single Chromebook model on the relevant <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366">Google support page</a>, so before you move that Lightning Deal Chromebook from your cart to the checkout, take ten seconds and look it up on this page. Most Chromebooks launched in 2021-2023 have 10 years of support ahead of them.</li></ol>

<p>A few upgrades to Samsung&apos;s Customer Care network for Galaxy owners follow quickly behind its latest wave of foldable devices.</p><p>In a press release, the company states Galaxy users can now call upon AT&T&apos;s Call Center agents for help regarding (in-warranty) walk-in phone repair services. The post adds that these services can be done at any one of its 700 Samsung retail or uBreakiFix by Asurion locations across the United States.</p><p>While this newfound phone repair service applies to AT&T customers, Samsung says the quickness of this method often leads to same-day opportunities. Moreover, the Korean OEM&apos;s work with AT&T adds Same Unit Repair (SUR) options to the network&apos;s customers.</p><p>In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-expands-next-generation-care-att-introduces-new-ai-powered-tools/">blog post</a>, Samsung stated it&apos;s committed to getting a person&apos;s sensitive device back into their hands quickly. Through SUR, repair services will work to get a user&apos;s device fixed to "factory quality condition" and return it without needing a "comparable new or refurbished unit."</p><p>Not only does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.att.com/story/2024/samsung-unpacked.html">SUR&apos;s availability</a> help cut back on e-waste, but Samsung states users won&apos;t have to worry about backing up data or transfers.</p><p>The other side of this update is Samsung&apos;s AI tools to help its experts handle and resolve your problem. This "next-gen Care" is strengthened by the new Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to help agents understand a user&apos;s reason for calling (intent). The software helps agents identify a customer&apos;s device and the problem to then direct them to the appropriate areas for help.</p><p>The AI can text a user located near them for walk-in service or an authorized repair center using their zip code. IVR also serves as a text-based alternative for customers interested in receiving status updates about a repair ticket&apos;s status.</p>

<p>Samsung reiterates the benefits of walk-in repair, such as the ability for customers to seek help if they have a Galaxy S21 device or newer. More importantly, your device can be fixed and returned to you if you&apos;ve scheduled an appointment at 3 PM or sooner.</p><p>Additionally, users can experience "personalized" consultation regarding the repair of their phone.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ubreakifix-expand-repair-options">Following its expansion</a>, Samsung has continued to push its efforts to bring convenient and easy device repair through uBreakiFix. Last August, both companies upgraded their partnership by adding more repair options to customers. At the same time, the companies started working on opening 50 new repair shops across the U.S. by the end of 2023. That was the start of quicker repairs and same-day service, as Samsung noted at the time.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following Samsung&apos;s Unpacked, the company started discussing its hopes for its latest foldables, which involves increasing its sales.</p><p>The company&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM (Tae-moon) Roh, spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240711002000320?">Yonhap News</a> and reporters following the event to discuss sales figures (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_wants_galaxy_z_fold6_and_flip6_to_deliver_10_better_sales_than_their_predecessors-news-63685.php">GSMArena</a>). Roh informed the press that the company aims "to sell 10 percent more of new products compared with the previous model released last year."</p><p>He added, "This time, we&apos;ve introduced products that are more complete and immaculate in every aspect, such as the camera and battery." These aspects may facilitate the "better results" Samsung expects from its 2024 foldable devices.</p><p>Roh then discussed the "user-friendly" features provided through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-boast-ai-upgrades-and-thinner-bodies">Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6</a> thanks to Qualcomm. Both devices feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy SoC in all regions. When the SD 8 Gen 3 debuted, the headliner was its strong focus on boosting the on-device AI capabilities of future flagship devices. The chip then provided boosts to a phone&apos;s CPU and GPU processes.</p><p>Samsung states the chip helps its foldable phones by "optimizing" its AI features and "enhancing" other basic functions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="6g3hCKDQ5AQvrPgptwQMpN" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-unboxing-andrew.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 out of the box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6g3hCKDQ5AQvrPgptwQMpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Andrew Myrick)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It remains to be seen how well Samsung&apos;s 2024 foldables perform, however, the Flip 5 and Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">shattered pre-order records</a> last year. The numbers stemmed from South Korea, where the company amassed a whopping 1.02 million foldable preorders. Among them, the Flip 5 took the crown with 70% of the cut.</p><p>Those sales broke Samsung&apos;s previous highest tallied count of 970,000 pre-order sales for its Galaxy foldable phones on home soil. With Roh estimating (and hoping) for a 10% growth in sales back by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, it&apos;s going to be interesting to see where consumer interest falls.</p><p>However, it&apos;s worth noting that Samsung&apos;s showing of the Fold 6 wasn&apos;t that impressive, leaving some to ponder <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-new-galaxy-z-fold-6">if the upgrade is worth it</a>. Aside from its AI focus, there was little by way of innovation from the Korean OEM&apos;s folding devices. Let&apos;s also not forget that the devices came at an extra cost — roughly $100.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re not far from Google&apos;s official Pixel 9 series debut, but a recent European rumor claims to have its pricing nailed.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/google-pixel-9-9-pro-9-pro-xl-et-9-pro-fold-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-francais-et-les-configurations-des-nouveaux-smartphones-55115">Dealabs</a> (French) suggests Google&apos;s upcoming flagship phone series could give consumers a steep pricing hill to climb (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_9_pixel_9_pro_pixel_9_pro_xl_and_pixel_9_pro_fold_prices_leak-news-63684.php">GSMArena</a>). The base Pixel 9 model will reportedly arrive in two internal storage sizes: 128GB and 256GB for 899 euros (~$980) and 999 euros (~$1,089), respectively.</p><p>The publication noted that these alleged prices are slightly higher than Google&apos;s Pixel 8. Even the Pixel 9 Pro could see a price hike as it&apos;s rumored to debut in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options. Rumored prices for each size are 1,099 euros (~$1,198), 1,199 euros (~$1,307), and 1,329 euros (~$1,449).</p><p>Rumors regarding the other two additions to the Pixel 9 series, the "Pixel 9 Pro XL" and the "Pixel 9 Pro Fold" are<strong> </strong>as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL</strong> — 128GB: 1,199 euros (~$1,307)</li><li>256GB: 1,299 euros (~$1,416)</li><li>512GB: 1,429 euros (~$1,558)</li><li>1TB: 1,689 euros (~$1,841)</li><li><strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold </strong>— 256GB: 1,899 euros (~$2,070)</li><li>512GB: 2,029 euros (~$2,212)</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="W7AyWrw8y7PJpt63aJB4tX" name="google-pixel-9-9-pro-alleged-back-panel.jpg" alt="A live photo supposedly depicting the back panels of the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7AyWrw8y7PJpt63aJB4tX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rozetked)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the publication claims these prices could be the "standard" across Europe, U.S. consumers shouldn&apos;t take them literally — not yet. These prices aren&apos;t a one-to-one conversion between regions, and Google will likely adjust them accordingly.</p><p>Colors were also an object of discussion, with the rumor that the Basel could see Obsidian, Porcelain, Cosmo, and a Mojito (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-summer-vibe-colors-leak" target="_blank">like the Bud&apos;s rumor</a>). The 9 Pro could see Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, and Pink for its 128GB and 256GB variants while the 512GB could grab Obsidian and Hazel.</p><p>The recently rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hits-geekbench">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> might see Obsidian, Hazel, and Porcelain for its 128GB and 512GB variants. The 1TB might only grab Obsidian, while the middle size sees the addition of pink. Lastly, the Fold successor may only grab two options: Obsidian and Porcelain.</p><p>Google is seemingly preparing for an interesting expansion of its flagship phone line as, in May, the entire series leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">in a set of live photos</a>. The base model may sport a 6.2-inch display, while the Pro offers a 6.3-inch display and a 6.7-inch screen for the 9 XL. Another notable design choice is that the device will reportedly switch between matte and glossy finishes on the back panel.</p><p>Moreover, the recent string of alleged colorways doubles down on what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-leaked-colorways-wallpaper-theme">we&apos;ve heard previously</a>. It seems that what was formerly known as "Rose" has turned into "pink" here in July. There&apos;s not much wait time ahead of us as Google started emailing users about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">an earlier hardware event</a>, set for August 13.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google will discontinue official support for Android Lollipop OS, which debuted with Nexus 6.</li><li>Also known as Android 5.0, it was widely popular for introducing Material You to Android devices.</li><li>The said OS will no longer receive Google Play Updates, citing that less than one percent of active devices are running it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you are one of the first owners of a Nexus 6 device, you were likely introduced to Android Lollipop for the first time, and it was surprisingly ten years ago. Google first introduced it in November 2014, and now, the official support is finally ending.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/11/android-lollipop-google-play-services/">9to5Google</a> points out, Google is discontinuing the Google Play Services updates to Android Lollipop devices starting this month. Per Google Spokesperson&apos;s statement to the publication, the reason for putting a nail in the coffin is the percentage of active Android Lollipop devices, which is said to be accounting for less than one percent at the moment. This has been a tradition followed by Google for its past versions of Android.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ThtF8h9HrZficLDkhMHDn" name="google-pixel-6-review-material-you-tinted-icon-gaps.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Material You Tinted Icon Gaps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ThtF8h9HrZficLDkhMHDn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, the previous iteration of Lollipop, Android KitKat, released 11 years ago, also had less than one percent active devices last July. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/google-play-services-discontinuing-updates-for-kitkat.html">chose to stop</a> the release of Google Play Services. This year appears no different, as more and more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are looking forward to the Android 15 update, which is likely happening after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made by Google event</a> on August 13.</p><p>Those wondering if the Android Lollipop devices are losing Google Play Services support will continue to work. Yes, they will; it is just that users won&apos;t be receiving "any new features, important security updates, and may not be compatible with some apps."</p>
<p>The latter&apos;s been the case with most sensitive apps already, like banking apps and popular social media apps, as they only support the previous three or four iterations of Android versions.</p><p>Nonetheless, Android Lollipop, aka Android 5.0, has been special for Google as it introduced Material You for the first time in 2014 to its popular Nexus devices—followed by a nifty update dubbed Android 5.1 the following year.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, dropping official support only means Google will prioritize the latest devices and upcoming operating systems, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. With Lollipop out of the race, Marshmallow handsets will likely be next in the line.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 Olympic Edition happens to be the first smartphone utilizing the Galaxy AI prowess. The previous Olympic Edition was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review">Galaxy S21</a>, which Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-2020-tokyo-olympics-athlete-gift-bag">provided</a> at the 2020 Olympics and Paralympic Games held in Tokyo in 2020. </p><p>As players come from all over the world to participate in the Olympic Games, they can take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>-backed features like Live translation of calls, Interpreter mode, and Composer mode to take calls, communicate, and send emails at the event. Similarly, the Instant Slow-mo feature can be widely used by players aided by the Photo Assist feature to capture athletes&apos; participation in various games. </p><p>Together, Samsung and Orange are providing an eSIM with 1000GB of 5G data with each special edition of the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The clamshell phone also gets two years of Samsung&apos;s international warranty. Users can also take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>, which comes pre-loaded with an in-app pass for vending machines and an unlimited complimentary public transport access card.</p>
<p>"Additionally, to keep track of the latest Games-time schedules and travel around the Olympic venues with ease, several official International Olympic Committee (IOC) apps such as Athlete 365, Olympic Shop, Paris 2024, Transport Accred App, and IOC hotline will be pre-loaded. "</p><p>Lastly, Galaxy Z Flip 6 Olympic Edition owners can utilize Paris-2024-themed apps such as PinQuest and Galaxy Experience to collect and exchange real and digital pins during the Games.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve tried giving up on smartwatches, honestly. It gets annoying when you have to remember to charge something other than a phone all of the time. But there are a few reasons why I cycle between the Apple Watch Ultra, the Galaxy Watch, and others, and Samsung just gave me another great reason to stick with wearing them with its latest smartwatches.</p><p>I&apos;ll start by saying that I&apos;m a sucker for keeping track of my sleep, as I can look at how long I was asleep and have a pretty idea of how the day is going to go. Instead of wondering why I feel like crap, I already know it&apos;d probably be due to the 3.5 hours of sleep that I&apos;m averaging.  </p><p>However, there&apos;s another potential reason, and it&apos;s one that I&apos;ve been avoiding for years — sleep apnea. For reasons that will become clear momentarily, I never thought that any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> would be capable of detecting sleep apnea.</p><p>In most instances, if you think you suffer from sleep apnea, you talk to your doctor and then perform a sleep study. However, introducing such a feature with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">Watch Ultra</a> will hopefully remove some guesswork. Instead of going to your doctor and just telling them that you&apos;re tired, you can <em>hopefully</em> use the data from your smartwatch to provide some support to your theory.</p>

<p>It&apos;s the introduction of this functionality that has me actually intrigued about picking up one of these. Over the years, I just assumed that I was put on this planet for the purpose of being exhausted. It wasn&apos;t until I began dating my now-wife that I realized something else might be going on. </p><p>There were several times when she would wake me up in the middle of the night, seemingly for no reason. As it turns out, she was doing it for a good reason: she would wake up in the middle of the night, and it would sound like I wasn&apos;t breathing. </p><p>Things got a little better after I lost about 50 pounds, but according to my wife, it still happens on occasion. The difference now is that if I&apos;m being woken up in the middle of the night, it&apos;s because something might be wrong with our five-month-old son.</p>

<p>If I turn off the "tech enthusiast" part of my brain and think about the potential health benefits and not just because it&apos;s something "new and shiny," a new Galaxy Watch might be in the cards. The only reason why I haven&apos;t pre-ordered one for myself just yet is because the feature is apparently coming to the Galaxy Watch 6.</p><p>When pairing my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a> running the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI Watch 6 beta</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, it appeared in the "new features" section. However, I have yet to be able to find any mention of it since, so I&apos;m not entirely convinced that it&apos;s going to work. At this point, I&apos;ll probably re-evaluate whether I&apos;ll upgrade or just stick with what I&apos;ve got.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gy2WHbiMy3wRLnjTiLVHBZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-health-sensors-illuminated.jpg" alt="The new Bioactive health sensor on the Galaxy Watch Ultra being illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gy2WHbiMy3wRLnjTiLVHBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is another reason that could drive me to upgrade anyway, and it&apos;s <em>partially</em> because of the "new and shiny" factor. With the Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, Samsung introduced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">new and enhanced BioActive sensor</a>. Samsung claims this will offer "more precise readings," thanks to the new array of LEDs paired with an "increased number of green, red, and infrared LEDs."</p><p>On paper, this should result in more accurate and reliable tracking, which should make the Watch 7 a better health accessory than its predecessor. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpg" alt="ECG on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s important for me to note that I called the Watch 7 a health "accessory" and didn&apos;t use a different adjective. You&apos;ll have to dig back into the Android Central archives a bit, but our own Jerry Hildenbrand wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/when-it-comes-to-your-health-dont-place-too-much-trust-in-your-smartwatch">something similar</a>. </p><p>Besides being a fantastic article, Jerry rightly points out that all of these various wearable devices can&apos;t replace actual equipment. I mean that in the sense of the equipment found in your doctor&apos;s office, it is not something you can pick up from Amazon or Best Buy. </p><p>The technology in our devices continues to evolve regularly, even in ways that you might not have known about. Wearable devices are even more prone to dramatic improvements, as there are regulatory hurdles to clear before a company can tell you that a smartwatch keeps track of your heart rate.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As Jerry says, "If you think something isn't right, go see the doctor and make sure. You can still enjoy your smartwatch even if it's not the caretaker of everything the company that sells it told you it was."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, these are also mass-produced on a completely different scale compared to health equipment. Companies need to make as many wearables as they can based on projected sales figures and available components. This is not a bad thing, but it&apos;s just something to keep in the back of your mind if you want to let a smartwatch tell you that everything&apos;s okay when it&apos;s actually the opposite. </p>

<p>Even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">surprising FDA approval</a>, Samsung&apos;s smartwatch can&apos;t tell you with any degree of certainty that you do, or don&apos;t, have sleep apnea. What it does do is nudge you in the right direction, suggesting that you reach out to your doctor or another healthcare professional. </p><p>I know that this probably sounds like I&apos;m doing a lot of mental gymnastics to justify buying the "latest and greatest." However, that&apos;s not actually the case this time around, as the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra offer legitimate health benefits that aren&apos;t found elsewhere. </p>
