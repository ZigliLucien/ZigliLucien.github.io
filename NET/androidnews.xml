This means it will become illegal for any app stores or web servers that host TikTok. </p><p>Congress alleged that TikTok is being controlled by a company in China, despite several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/delivering-on-our-us-data-governance">reassurances</a> from the social media app that it is privately owned. This week, TikTok sent an in-app alert to U.S. users urging them to call their local representatives to oppose the bill. </p><p>“Your voice can help the TikTok communities you love,” the message said.</p><p>This move was taken after the U.S. government raised concerns about risks to national security and the data of users on the platform.</p><p>According to a recent tweet, a spokesperson from TikTok is calling this bill a &apos;ban&apos; and hopes that the Senate will consider facts before taking any action.</p>

<p>According to Rahman, this nifty feature has been visible on the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. However, not all users seem to have experienced this. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, which also runs on Wear OS 4, hasn’t yet received the feature, notes Rahman in an accompanying Threads post.</p><p>The app install progress indicator is usually buried in the Google Play Store on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets, and it appears to be a new addition for the Pixel Watch owners. While some Android device app launchers already support the feature, it is also widely popular on Apple iPhone’s home screens. It is still unclear whether the feature is part of the March 2024 that the Pixel Watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-march-2024-update">received</a> early this month.</p>
<p>The latest firmware brought the newest security patches, which were accompanied by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-devices-get-march-feature-drop">Feature Drop</a>. The latter carried some of the Pixel Watch 2 goodness to the original Pixel Watch, including features like pace training, heart zone training, and auto workout mode as well. The original Pixel Watch, which is about to turn two and still receiving some nice features, is a welcome addition.</p><p>On the other hand, the search giant is already working on the third iteration, tentatively dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-next-pixel-watch-will-reportedly-come-in-bigger-45mm-size">rumored</a> to be more prominent than its predecessor, featuring 45mm in size. Meanwhile, it is encouraging to see Google engaging its older Pixel Watch users with the aforementioned nifty additions.</p>

What&apos;s particularly interesting is that you now get lossless music as standard with Apple Music, and that is a huge differentiator. Even though I subscribed to Spotify for the better part of a decade now, I had Tidal as a secondary service because of the higher-quality catalog.</p>

<p>But with Apple Music essentially democratizing lossless audio, I didn&apos;t see any need to use Tidal — or Spotify, for that matter. I still subscribe to Spotify, but most of my casual listening these days is on Apple Music. And when it comes to budget audio gear, there has been a radical change over the last three years.</p>
<p>While wireless earbuds are still the dominant choice, there&apos;s been a meteoric rise in IEMs (in-ear monitors) in recent years, and it has coincided with the rollout of lossless streaming. At the outset, it isn&apos;t hard to see why; while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds-samsung-galaxy-s22">best wireless earbuds</a> have plenty of useful additions and a great sound, they&apos;re still not quite on the same level as IEMs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AtzJ4fgMLob4HQw3SN8bNf" name="fiio-ka11-11.jpg" alt="Fiio KA11 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AtzJ4fgMLob4HQw3SN8bNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And although the 3.5mm jack is a distant memory on phones, you can now get a great dongle DAC for not a lot of cash — the $30 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">Fiio KA11</a> illustrates this well — and get much better sound while on the go. Like with most segments, renewed interest in IEMs is largely down to a wave of Chinese audio manufacturers that offer a terrific value.</p>
<p>I tested dozens of IEMs in the last 12 months, and the key takeaway is that budget earbuds have never sounded better. Brands like Fiio, Moondrop, and KZ Audio have plenty of budget options under $50 that sound incredible, and they&apos;re just as durable as costlier earbuds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="W76sMjn3aSxn5Zk3LPtaSL" name="fiio-fx-15-3.jpg" alt="Fiio FX15 IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W76sMjn3aSxn5Zk3LPtaSL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are dozens of standout choices in the $100 to $300 segment, and I think this is the sweet spot if you&apos;re interested in venturing back into IEMs. If anything, you start seeing diminishing returns once you cross the $500 mark. The $649 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">Fiio FX15</a> is the brand&apos;s costliest IEM as of writing, and it uses a combination of three sets of drivers to produce a fantastic sound with excellent layering and a wide soundstage. Thieaudio also uses a similar system in its $1,299 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-prestige-ltd-review">Prestige LTD</a>, but is that twice as good as the Fiio? No.</p>
<p>Budget IEMs that cost just $25 — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Linsoul-TANGZU-Waner-S-G-Detachable/dp/B0BL16M8FH">Tangzu Wan&apos;er</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Linsoul-7Hz-Crinacle-Zero-Earphones/dp/B0CMZVZPCF">7Hz Salnotes Zero 2</a> — redefine the category as a whole, making it much more accessible to get great sound on the go. And considering you can get a good dongle DAC at around the $30 mark, you&apos;re looking at $55 for a portable audio setup that lets you enjoy lossless music.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="XoDaRPyFZ8mYKMamaC6zUT" name="fiio-ka11-shot.jpg" alt="Fiio KA11 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XoDaRPyFZ8mYKMamaC6zUT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="878" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That would have been unthinkable even three years ago, but it illustrates the breakneck speed of the audio industry these days. Yes, I understand that wireless earbuds still have unmatched convenience, and while the sound quality has improved considerably — thanks to the use of innovative solid-state drivers in the case of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/creative-aurvana-ace-2-review">Creative Aurvana Ace 2</a> — they still don&apos;t have the same effortless elegance of IEMs, and you don&apos;t get as refined a sound.</p><p>So if you miss the days of plugging in a pair of earbuds to your phone and listening to music, now is the time to delve back in.</p>

<p>Google dished out $10 million to researchers worldwide in 2023 for sniffing out and safely flagging security issues in its products and services.</p><p>Last year, 632 researchers from 68 different countries received rewards, but the total amount was a bit less compared to the $12 million that Google&apos;s Vulnerability Reward Program awarded to researchers in 2022. The biggest payout for a vulnerability report in 2023 reached $113,337, as per Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/03/vulnerability-reward-program-2023-year.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>In 2023, Google made a new addition to the VRP by including generative AI. The search giant hosted a live hacking event aimed at large language models, where researchers attempted to coax secrets out of Bard, now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, by feeding it specific prompts. Google raked in 35 reports from this event, paying out over $87,000 in bounties.</p><p>Google spotlighted two major projects: "Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration" and "We Hacked Google A.I. for $50,000".</p><p>As for Android and Google&apos;s own devices, the company awarded $3.4 million. The company also bumped up the maximum payout for critical vulnerabilities in this category to a sweet $15,000.</p><p>Google also brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS</a> into the program, welcoming security researchers to report bugs and vulnerabilities in the wearable platform. It handed out $70,000 for 20 critical discoveries in Wear OS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-automotive-hands-on">Android Automotive</a> OS.</p><p>Google Chrome researchers also snagged a chunk of the payout, bagging $2.1 million for 359 unique reports. They addressed some longstanding issues with V8 encoding that had slipped under the radar before.</p><p>Another highlight is the introduction of <em>MiraclePtr </em>in Chrome M116, aimed at safeguarding against non-renderer Use-After-Free UAF vulnerabilities.</p><p>After these flaws were considered "highly mitigated" with the introduction of <em>MiraclePtr</em>, Google rolled out a separate class of rewards specifically for bypassing the protection mechanism itself.</p><p>Google also awarded $116,000 for 50 reports on issues found in Nest, Fitbit, and wearables.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company beefed up payouts for reports of higher quality, encouraging researchers to zero in on more severe issues.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Nothing Phone (2a) is turning out to be one of the best options if you want a budget phone in 2024. The phone has the same bold styling as the Phone (1) and Phone (2), and it even includes LED lighting at the back that&apos;s mated to the Glyph interface. Having used the phone for just under a week now, it&apos;s clear that Nothing wanted to deliver a similar level of experience as its costlier phones, but in the budget segment.</p><p>There&apos;s just one problem: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Phone (2a)</a> isn&apos;t launching in the U.S. Nothing made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone (2)</a> available to purchase via its U.S. website last year, but the Phone (2a) is being sold in limited quantities in the region, and you have to sign up as a developer to be eligible to pick up the device. Even then, there&apos;s no official warranty.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-co-founder-akis-evangelidis-phone-2a-interview">asked Nothing co-founder Akis Evangelidis</a> the reason for not launching the Phone (2a) Stateside, and he said that it isn&apos;t the "right time to go all-in" in the U.S. just yet. "We&apos;re still just a three-year-old brand, so we have to be strategic about our efforts. While we need to maintain a level of presence in the U.S., it isn&apos;t the right time to go all-in just yet considering the size of the market."</p><p>As for the limited presence, Nothing sells its audio products in the U.S., and Evangelidis confirmed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">ear (1)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear (2)</a> sold really well in the region. But when it comes to the phone segment, there&apos;s a similar refrain that I&apos;ve heard from just about every phone manufacturer that doesn&apos;t have a major presence in the country: dealing with carriers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most global markets, Nothing can&apos;t just sell the phone via its website and hope to make any sort of dent in the budget segment. Carriers control the U.S. smartphone industry, and Evangelidis noted that the brand isn&apos;t "in a rush," and that it is looking to secure the right carrier partnership before making a full-fledged debut in the country. "The unlocked market is quite limited, so there&apos;s only so much you can do as a standalone brand. We need to find the right partner that understands our strategy and believes in the brand. You can only enter the market once, and we want to get that right — we&apos;re not in a rush."</p><p>Regarding the Phone (2), which was available unlocked on Nothing&apos;s website, Evangelidis said that as the device was aimed at early adopters, it was a straightforward decision to sell it directly. But the Phone (2a) is intended as a mass-market device, and without a carrier partnership, it didn&apos;t make sense for the brand to launch it in the country.</p><p>There&apos;s good reason for Evangelidis to be wary when it comes to partnering with a U.S. carrier. Evangelidis and Carl Pei were at OnePlus when the Chinese manufacturer teamed up with T-Mobile to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6t-review">OnePlus 6T</a> in the country, and what was lauded as a major win for the company turned sour as T-Mobile&apos;s requirements didn&apos;t line up with OnePlus&apos;s strategy at the time.</p><p>The way I understood it, T-Mobile wanted phones to be available for at least 12 months after month, and OnePlus would only sell its devices for six months — this was during the T series refresh. The result was that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-review">OnePlus 7T</a> was available on T-Mobile well after stock ran out just about everywhere else in the world, and these days, OnePlus only sells its entry-level Nord N series with the carrier, with its flagships like the OnePlus 12 sold unlocked on its website and Amazon.</p><p>As for Nothing, Evangelidis said the brand would take its time choosing a carrier partner before selling its phones in the region. He talked about how the partnership works in other regions, hailing India&apos;s Flipkart as the "benchmark" in this regard. Ultimately, the Phone (2a) is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phones of 2024</a>, but U.S. users miss out on the device — like dozens of other phones — because of the unique carrier-dominated ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Xiaomi may be gearing up to disrupt the foldable smartphone market with its upcoming flagship, the MIX Fold 4.</li><li>A new rumor points to significant upgrades in build quality, particularly a sturdier body and hinge design, which could minimize creasing on the folding screen.</li><li>The MIX Fold 4 is expected to offer top-notch performance with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, along with a massive 16GB RAM and 1TB storage.</li></ul>

<p>Xiaomi is preparing to shake things up in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable smartphone race</a> with its upcoming flagship, the MIX Fold 4. While it might still be a while before it hits store shelves, some juicy details about what to expect from the device are starting to surface.</p><p>According to a scoop shared by Digital Chat Station on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/O4FnHhgwX?pagetype=groupfeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, the Xiaomi MIX Fold 4 might be a huge upgrade with a sturdier body and hinge (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/xiaomi-mix-fold-4-leaked-specs_id156192" target="_blank">PhoneArena</a>). The tipster says this new hinge will mean less creasing on the folding screen.</p><p>Under the hood, the MIX Fold 4 could be rocking Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, which makes sense since it&apos;s going to be another flagship from Xiaomi. Plus, rumor has it that the foldable phone will pack a whopping 16GB of RAM and a massive 1TB of storage.</p><p>The battery on board is rumored to be 5000mAh, with support for 100W charging. To put things in perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-fold-3-launch">MIX Fold 3</a> had a 4800mAh battery with 67W charging.</p><p>According to DCS, the phone might sport a 50MP main camera with a fixed, wide aperture. There&apos;s also talk about a new periscope camera that could potentially replace its predecessor&apos;s 5x 10MP sensor with a higher-resolution shooter, promising better long-range zoom capabilities.</p><p>Xiaomi may also have new tricks up its sleeve. As per the tipster, the upcoming foldable phone could come equipped with two-way satellite communications and even water resistance. If that turns out to be true, it looks like Samsung might have some serious competition to deal with.</p><p>However, Xiaomi might decide to reserve some of these features exclusively for the domestic market.</p><p>The Xiaomi MIX Fold series has traditionally been limited to the Chinese market, but according to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gsmchina.com/xiaomi-mix-fold-4-will-be-the-first-global-mix-fold-device-ever-4628/" target="_blank">leak</a>, the MIX Fold 4 might just break that trend and see a global release.</p><p>The foldable phone race continues to become more intense than we expected, with companies rolling out some seriously impressive models, and Xiaomi seems poised to raise the bar even further.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s year-old flagship trio is beginning to receive the latest security update in the U.S.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/unlocked-galaxy-s23-march-2024-security-update-usa/">SamMobile</a>, the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus, and S23 Ultra have been spotted picking up the March 2024 security patch. The publication notes that this download is now available for unlocked devices, finally joining locked carrier S23 devices. Users should see patch version <strong>BXBD</strong> once their phone picks it up.</p><p>A user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23/comments/1bcioum/march_1_security_patch_s23/">Reddit</a> posted a screenshot of their S23 Plus downloading the (very light) security patch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-us-march-2024-security-update-unlocked/">Android Police</a>). It provided a look at the trio&apos;s changelog, which only states that the device&apos;s security "has been improved."</p><p>Additionally, the patch arrives with a 400MB download size.</p><p>Samsung provided its usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">official changelog</a>, which states there are 35 fixes "High" priority fixes. There are only two "Critical" level fixes for March. The Korean OEM applied a fix for AppLocker, stating that it should prevent unauthorized attackers from reconfiguring its settings.</p><p>More fixes arrive to prevent memory corruption, sensitive information exposure through your MAC address, and other vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>On Google&apos;s side, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-03-01">has provided</a> eight Framework fixes and five for Android systems.</p><p>The March update should start arriving today on the S23 series, and your device should download it automatically. But if you&apos;re curious, go to <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download and Install </strong>to check for it.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s March 2024 security update is making its rounds, as a week ago, the Galaxy S24 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/second-galaxy-s24-software-update-is-out">picked it up</a>. The patch was also pretty light, only lending a hand to correct several bugs and some stability problems for the newest flagship series. It also came a couple of weeks after Samsung rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/first-major-galaxy-s24-patch">very first update</a> for the S24, which was to offer relief for users unhappy with the Vivid display changes.</p><p>The most notable part of this March patch for the S23 is its lack of Galaxy AI features.  The Korean OEM plans to bring a few of its latest on-device and cloud-based AI tools to some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-features-coming-to-older-galaxy-phones">past-gen devices</a>. The Galaxy S23 series is among those eligible, however, we haven&apos;t gotten that yet.</p><p>It looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-one-ui-61-update-and-ai-features-incoming">we aren&apos;t far from it</a>, as it&apos;s expected that the S24&apos;s Galaxy AI features should arrive via a One UI 6.1 patch later in March.</p>

<ul><li>During Google's Game Developer Summit, the company detailed new additions arriving for users on the Play Store.</li><li>Users will begin noticing YouTube videos on the Play Store today about its most popular games, alongside some more game content visibility.</li><li>Google Play Games is adding more native PC gaming support for additional titles and more in-game rewards for Play Pass subscribers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Game Developer Summit started today, and the company is highlighting a few new updates for Android gaming that are arriving today.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-for-games-developer-summit-2024/">Keyword</a> post, the Play Store is rolling out "new ways to engage" with your mobile games. The company states users should begin noticing YouTube videos about some of the Play Store&apos;s most popular games in the "Games" tab. Additionally, these videos will appear on listing pages.</p><p>Google stated in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/key-product-updates-from-2024-google-for-games-developer-summit.html">Android Developers</a> blog post that store listings will now "more prominently" display game updates, new content, and ongoing gaming promotions. However, these changes will not affect everyone, as Google states that they will apply to English-language users and "select titles" in its program.</p><p>Developers are also gaining new tools for in-game ads, as the company states users may find them seamlessly integrated with the game they&apos;re playing. This applies to pop-up ads and video ad breaks, as mobile gaming developers can now run the ad without removing the player from their experience.</p><p>Alongside these Play Store updates, users should begin noticing Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-ai-generated-faqs-features-leak">AI-generated FAQ section</a> appearing on an app&apos;s details page.</p>

<p>PC enjoyers are receiving additional Google Play Games support for native desktop gaming. Users will soon have access to a more expansive library of supported mobile games on PC. Google states Solo Leveling: Aris is preparing to join the likes of Genshin Impact, Odin: Valhalla, and Lineage2M through its Play Games desktop launcher.</p><p>Play Pass subscribers are in for a treat. Starting today (Mar.12), they are receiving extra bonuses for in-game goodies. The post states that these extra in-game items and discounts are on their way for EA SPORTS FC Mobile, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, MONOPOLY GO!, and Roblox.</p><p>Google&apos;s Play Pass has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/key-product-updates-from-2024-google-for-games-developer-summit.html#:~:text=Expanded%20programs%20to%20accelerate%20growth">reportedly grown by 120%</a> in the past year. The company states it will roll out the subscription service&apos;s in-game rewards in 21 markets in 2024, including Japan. Additionally, it will bring Play Pass to South Korea "later this year."</p><p>The company has turned to its loyalty rewards program, "Play Points," stating that it has achieved over 220 million members and will soon launch in Brazil.</p><p>Lastly, Google is giving developers additional tools to give users more sign-in options for Play Games services. The company doesn&apos;t expand on what these extra options could look like; however, it states that your earned achievements and game progress will follow you no matter the method you prefer.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit has launched the "Walk Mate" program, which will last two months as the company is eager to learn how to better encourage users to "stay active."</li><li>Users will be given personalized notifications daily to help them plan their daily walks.</li><li>Fitbit and Google recently participated in a study to help understand how to facilitate better metabolic health in users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitbit has been spotted starting a new study that brings "personalized" notifications to users daily.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/11/fitbit-walkmate/">9to5Google</a>, "Walk Mate" is a two-month study the company is kickstarting to encourage users to walk more and "stay active." Fitbit lets users join the program with the app&apos;s "Step" card, which then offers a survey. Users with an average of 8,000 steps per day or less will see this appear in their Steps card.</p><p>The company appears curious about "what general situations might affect your physical activity." Users will find questions asking if they are beneath the average steps per day threshold if they&apos;ve been advised against exercising by a doctor, and if they are in the U.S.</p><p>Some additional program details state users enrolled in the Walkmate program will receive one notification daily to "reflect on so you can plan your walk for the day." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sign-fitbit-premium">Fitbit</a> has also opened the floodgates for user feedback moving forward. Additionally, users will find a "Walk Mate" card on the Fitbit app&apos;s home screen (the Today tab).</p><p>The publication adds these personalized notifications through Walk Mate will appear in the same fashion as Fitibit&apos;s hourly reminders to get moving.</p><p>Considering Google Health and Studies is behind this program, the company will take in your data to see different "get active" strategies folks prefer, how long users stick with such strategies, and more.</p>

<p>Fitbit&apos;s shift to help understand how to get people walking comes two months after it began a study on users&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-fitbit-wear-me-study">metabolic health</a>. Google was eager to understand what factors contribute to good metabolic health, as it was discovered that only 12% of adults in America fit that category. Fitbit wearables and Google&apos;s Pixel Watch are outfitted with sensors to help capture data about a user&apos;s metabolism.</p><p>However, Google wanted to go deeper, requiring users to submit a blood sample to measure cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels.</p><p>Fitbit submitted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-patent-shows-plans-to-monitor-mental-health">discovery of a patent</a> regarding a device that could monitor a user&apos;s mental health back in January. The patent was originally filed in 2021 but recently received approval in January 2024. Such a device is said to use machine learning to assess if the wearer has a mental disorder, like depression.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the performance improvements include enhancements to background app performance; the touchscreen experience will also see some improvements. Haptic feedback has new nifty adjustments with the addition of new levels. Nothing says users should also experience overall refinements across the user interface and animations in the Nothing OS 2.5.3.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/6368-nothing-os-253-rolling-out-for-phone-2a">full changelog</a> further showcases the bug fixes with the latest release, which includes the reset issue on the Pedometer widget, which apparently was reset after a change in time zones. In certain scenarios, app icons seem to have been missing while unlocking the screen, which is fixed with the latest release. </p><p>Similarly, an occasional black screen issue on the lock screen interface and fingerprint unlock issue (while the screen is off) is also addressed.</p>
