<ul><li>Quickly following a rash of user reports, Google is rolling out an update for Android Auto's Maps beta to solve its problems.</li><li>Users on Reddit have reported severe crashing with Android Auto when attempting to open Google Maps or use voice commands.</li><li>In the meantime, users may have to use Maps on their phones instead of Android Auto as the patch takes time to reach devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is quickly rushing out a patch for affected Android Auto devices that have encountered problems with its Maps beta.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-beta-crashing-android-auto/">Android Police</a> spotted the company rolling out a patch for the Maps beta marked as version <strong>11.132.01.01</strong> to Android Auto devices for the crashes. It might take a while before your device picks it up, so it could be best to avoid the Google Maps beta altogether.</p><p>For context, the company rolled out its latest Maps beta earlier this week, marked as version 11.132.0100. After installing, users quickly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/google_maps_beta_version_111320100_breaks_android/">took to Reddit</a> to report that the software broke their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> consoles. One user report highlighted that initiating Android Auto would crash Google Maps, leaving users in an endless cycle of crashing and returning to their app list.</p><p>Opening the app on an Android phone works fine, but throwing its contents over to your car is where things fall apart. Voice commands were also reportedly breaking the app and Android Auto&apos;s software.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/comment/l752i3l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user stated</a> they left the Maps beta and uninstalled all updates, reverting to the stable build, and still encountered problems. Hopefully, Google&apos;s latest attempt at a patch rectifies the problem.</p><p>There appears to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/comment/l75d66c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">an issue with charging</a>, as well, as one user reported that their phone is no longer charging when plugged into their console. Another user confirmed the problem, but it&apos;s unclear if this problem is related to the Maps beta issues.</p>

<p>As previously stated, Google has started rolling out a new patch today (June 6) to try and correct the Maps beta&apos;s effects on Android Auto. If you&apos;re involved and are uninterested in waiting, you can grab the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/maps/maps-11-132-0101-release/">APK Mirror file</a>.</p><p>Shortly after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a>, the company rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-make-car-rides-more-fun-with-new-entertainment-and-navigation-apps">a few features</a> for Android Auto to help bring some life to long car rides. Among the additions, drivers gained apps like Max, Peacock, and even Angry Birds. The update included the debut of Google Cast on the Android Automotive OS, which lets users throw content like videos from their phones to their vehicle&apos;s console.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A dive into the Google Drive app highlighted the company's work at bringing a new document-scanning feature to users.</li><li>It was spotted that Google could let users save their scanned documents as JPG files, creating a high-quality save of every scanned page.</li><li>Google Drive was recently spotted working on a new category system for users that would help them re-discover the most important files.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users working with documents and PDFs might gain a useful upgrade in quality for what they upload to Google Drive.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-drive-save-scanned-document-as-jpeg-apk-teardown-3449048/">Android Authority</a> in an APK search, Google is working on a way to save scanned documents as .jpeg files alongside the usual PDF option. A few strings point toward this coming functionality in the latest version of Drive, v2.24.2. Strings like "jpeg_format_label" refer to the .jpeg save option while the "ds_jpeg_quality_summary" tag is for the quality of saved pages.</p><p>It looks like Google will let users personally set the level of quality for scanned documents, according to its code. One string refers to the JPEG default quality, which is seemingly set at 80. This will likely be shown beneath the "quality_title" highlighted in the code.</p><p>Additionally, Drive&apos;s JPEG option for scanned documents will create multiple files if the JPEG option is desired. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-drive-tips-and-tricks">Google Drive</a> app shows a string that reads "jpeg_multipage_explanation." Its description details that "saving as JPG will create multiple files."</p><p>The publication speculates that Drive will create a high-quality image of every page within that uploaded document for user convenience.</p><p>JPEG files will likely be a boon to users trying to send pages of important information, especially if a PDF file isn&apos;t accepted. For now, this is just a discovery, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see when/if Google rolls it out to users.</p>

<p>With better document scanning (hopefully) on the way, Google was spotted working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-category-system-spotted">better category system</a> for Drive. The discovery in its Android app showed that users could soon gain a customizable category filter on the "Home" tab. Categories like auto, banking, expenses, home, IDS, insurance, and more were found.</p><p>Google intends to let users choose which categories mean the most and display them in a row at the top of the Home tab. A new "Manage categories" option will join this update, available in the three-dot menu of a document. Tapping it will let users assign certain tags (categories) to a document for easy discovery.</p><p>Also, in April, Google brought Drive&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-search-filters-android">useful search upgrade</a>, which launched first on iOS, to Android users. Folks can quickly search for files they&apos;ve modified recently and other modifiers like "File Type" and "Owner."</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s advanced AI assistant app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, appears to have overcome initial regulatory hurdles and is now available for download in the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p><p>Despite initial announcements of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">global launch in early May</a>, Google&apos;s rollout of its Gemini app bypassed the European region unless you turned to third-party app stores. This delay, likely due to regulatory considerations, has now been addressed.</p><p>Now, the Gemini app has begun a phased rollout across the European continent, following its February debut in the United States, broadening its user base beyond its initial domestic launch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/gemini-mobile-app-finally-comes-eu-uk/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>This means millions more users can now use Gemini on the fly. Additionally, Google Pixel users are able to seamlessly switch from the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to Gemini, enabling voice activation through the familiar "Hey Google" prompt.</p><p>While Gemini offers a compelling alternative to Assistant, it&apos;s important to note that currently, only one assistant can be your primary choice. Switching to Gemini will disable some functionalities previously handled by Assistant.</p><p>While Gemini excels at handling mobile tasks with improved context-awareness, it currently doesn&apos;t support smart home integration. Users who rely on Assistant for this should proceed cautiously and stick to using Gemini for web-based tasks for the time being. A future update may hopefully bring smart home compatibility.</p><p>The delayed European launch of Gemini mirrors the rollout strategy of its predecessor, Bard. Similar regulatory concerns about user privacy likely required a staggered release schedule for Bard in the EU.</p><p>Google plans to enhance accessibility by integrating Gemini directly into the official Google app for iOS in the coming weeks. This means iPhone users won&apos;t need to download a separate app, making it easier to access Gemini on a platform familiar to many mobile users.</p><p>The broader availability of the app signifies Google&apos;s embrace of the generative AI era, marking a strategic shift towards integrating AI functionalities across various product lines. This includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">launch of Gemini-powered Chromebook laptops</a>, highlighting Google&apos;s dedication to a future where AI is central to user experiences.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is gearing up for multiple product launches in July, including the launch of foldables alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. On the other hand, there have been rumblings of a fan edition Galaxy Watch that could drop. A new leak reveals what the budget-friendly Galaxy Watch FE looks like.</p><p>The leak comes from tipster Sudhanshu Ambhore on X, who shared three interesting renders of the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-likely-to-bring-galaxy-watch-fe-soon">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, the company’s first Fan Edition smartwatch. The renders are in three conventional Black, Blue, and Rose/Pink variants.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: Samsung Galaxy Watch FE renders! pic.twitter.com/Jtzp9eUIaC<a href="https://twitter.com/Sudhanshu1414/status/1797874557132619872">June 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The tipster also shared additional details of the next budget smartwatch from Samsung, which will sport a 1.2-inch AMOLED display accompanied by an Exynos W920 dual-core CPU with 1.18GHz clock speeds.</p><p>It will further feature 1.5GB of RAM paired with 16GB of onboard storage, and it will ship with Wear OS with Samsung’s One UI 5.0 running on top of it.

<ul><li>Corning has introduced Gorilla Glass 7i for budget smartphones, promising superior drop and scratch resistance.</li><li>The new glass is proven to withstand falls from up to one meter onto rough surfaces, outperforming competitors.</li><li>OPPO will be the first to use Gorilla Glass 7i in its future models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Corning has unveiled Gorilla Glass 7i, its new glass for budget smartphones that promises superior drop and scratch resistance compared to the competition.</p><p>The Gorilla Glass 7i is billed as a tougher screen for mid-range and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a>, and Corning said in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2024/06/corning-launches-corningr-gorillar-glass-7i-expanding-portfolio-of-durable-cover-glasses.html" target="_blank">press release</a> that it&apos;s stronger against drops and scratches than similar glasses, all without breaking the bank. This means better protection for a broader set of consumers.</p><p>During testing at Corning&apos;s labs, Gorilla Glass 7i proved its toughness by withstanding falls from up to one meter onto rough surfaces like asphalt. As per Corning, this puts Gorilla Glass 7i way ahead of the competition, whose glasses usually crack from much shorter falls.</p><p>The company aims for the new glass to address the persistence of earlier Gorilla Glass iterations like Gorilla Glass 5 within the mid-range smartphone segment. As these glasses age, there&apos;s a growing demand for a newer, cost-effective option that offers superior protection for today&apos;s bigger and better screens, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, which still uses Gorilla Glass 3.</p><p>David Velasquez, Corning&apos;s vice president and general manager, emphasized that durability and protection are always top priorities for the company, no matter the price of the device.</p><p>Gorilla Glass 7i goes beyond just drop protection, offering double the scratch resistance of other lithium aluminosilicate glasses on the market. It&apos;s an attractive solution for mid-range smartphone makers looking to boost durability without increasing costs and passing them on to consumers.</p><p>OPPO will be the first smartphone maker to feature Gorilla Glass 7i in its upcoming models. Specific details regarding these highly anticipated devices are expected to be unveiled in the near future.</p><p>Although originally designed for smartphones, Gorilla Glass 7i&apos;s impressive durability also makes it ideal for other devices like smartwatches, so it&apos;s only a matter of time before we see Corning&apos;s new glass make its debut on wearable devices.</p>

<p>Shokz OpenFit Air is available today, June 5th, in black, white, and pink. You can pick them up for $119.95. OpenSwim Pro is available today in two colors, grey or red, for $179.95. </p><p>With the OpenFit Air, it&apos;s hard to tell how often you&apos;ll be able to pick them up for less than MSRP, though they&apos;ve seen price drops on Amazon almost monthly since December 2023. OpenSwim was on sale bi-monthly, but that may have been an early incentive to purchase due to it having fewer features than the new OpenSwim Pro.</p><p>You can buy both devices directly from Shokz.com or Amazon.com right now. If a trip to the brick-and-mortar is more your speed, they&apos;re available at Best Buy. </p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-openfit-air-what-i-like"><span>OpenFit Air: What I like</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="k9VuohHEmxDSVtaK5f6hna" name="shokz-openfit-air-hero.jpg" alt="Shokz OpenFit Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9VuohHEmxDSVtaK5f6hna.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let&apos;s begin with the OpenFit Air. There are a few reasons someone may want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">an open-ear product like this</a>. They could have a few piercings in one or both ears. Maybe they don&apos;t like the feeling of in-ear devices. Then there are the usual use cases you read about: outdoor exercise or a worksite that requires unobstructed hearing. </p><p>Either way, it&apos;s important to note first that the trade-off with having your ear canals unobstructed is the depth of bass you will get. It&apos;s simple physics, and there&apos;s really no way yet to overcome that. Some, like Bose, have come quite close, but you&apos;ll pay almost three times more for those than for the OpenFit Air.</p><p>Speaking of paying more, what differentiates the OpenFit Air from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a> besides price? As the name suggests, although their weight difference is negligible, the new Air unit <em>feels</em> lighter than the OpenFit. Shokz took user feedback and moved the battery from the stem portion behind your ear on the OpenFit model to the module over your ear in the OpenFit Air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7SLLWp7W4tgZwQBN8nB2Y" name="shokz-openfit-air-openfit-driver-curve-comparison.jpg" alt="Curve of the driver module: Shokz OpenFit Air versus OpenFit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7SLLWp7W4tgZwQBN8nB2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Curve of the driver module: Shokz OpenFit Air versus OpenFit </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, they added more curves to the entire earbud and the module that houses the 18 x 11mm custom composite dynamic driver unit. The earbud now sits at a 25.5-degree angle while the beveled driver housing sits at 18 degrees, so it fits better in your ear than the OpenFit. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vs6kApJfoqbZTdjZcXB3iT" name="shokz-openfit-air-wearing-CU.jpg" alt="Shokz OpenFit Air being worn by Tshaka" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vs6kApJfoqbZTdjZcXB3iT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In my testing and comparing the two units, I think this new fit will benefit some and be a negligible difference for others. I like the heavier feel of the OpenFit, and I have terribly small ear canals, so the smaller driver module of the OpenFit works fine for me. That said, the OpenFit Air does feel lighter and just as comfortable to wear for extended periods without feeling like it&apos;s flailing around the outside of your ear as some open earbuds do.</p><p>Sound out of the OpenFit Air has solid clarity in the mids and highs, with good separation in the stereo image. OpenFit Air sounds pretty good as open-ear products go, thanks to the OpenBass Air low-frequency algorithm and Shokz DirectPitch technology, which pushes sound directly into the ear while minimizing leakage. </p><p>The genres that shine brightest with the OpenFit Air tend to be pop, rock, folk, and classical. Hip-hop is fine. You&apos;ll be light on the "Boom" but still get decent "bap." Switching from music to movies, I didn&apos;t experience any latency in dialog, and the bass reproduction was satisfying enough to give action sequences in movies or anime the enjoyable thump they should have. And with movies that feature 5.1 audio, the stereo image these produce is solid.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shokz-openswim-pro-what-wowed-me"><span>Shokz OpenSwim Pro: What wowed me</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5ikAuCTbQDGnLL38J7zgef" name="shokz-openswim-pro-tshaka-swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming laps wearing the OpenSwim Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ikAuCTbQDGnLL38J7zgef.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The previous OpenSwim product escaped my notice. Likely because it was just a standalone MP3 player in the body of a pair of bone-conduction headphones. I don’t swim often, so they weren&apos;t my jam. Shokz may have felt that sentiment from more users than me, so the OpenSwim Pro is no longer a one-trick seahorse. </p><p>You still get the MP3 player with an increased 32GB of storage for MP3, WMA, FLAC, WAV, AAC, M4A, and APE files. That&apos;s more storage than any competing product. Depending on which file types you use, you can cram around 8,000 songs into them — plenty for an Ironman or two. Now, though, you get more utility out of them with the included Bluetooth 5.4 radio so that when you aren&apos;t in the pool, you can stream music, movies, podcasts, or whatever you fancy, right from your phone.</p><p>What&apos;s most interesting about these headphones is their underwater sound quality. It is seriously impressive. I&apos;d almost say that they sound better underwater! Imagine that. This underwater awesome is achieved by OpenSwim Pro having triple-sealed components rated for IP68 dust and water ingress which means you&apos;re good up to (two meters) six feet deep for up to two hours. That&apos;s the first part. </p><p>Once you&apos;re in the pool, you can switch the headphones to MP3 mode and choose the Swimming EQ preset (you also have a Standard EQ preset). The Swimming preset flattens the sound profile, sounding tinny out of the water and killing bass response but giving you an underwater listening experience that is highly impressive. The bass magically reappears, giving you a delightfully robust sound as you hit those freestyle strokes or do some underwater laps.</p><p>Just don&apos;t pass six feet of depth, since it could damage the OpenSwim Pro. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GwCjWjaautiXEMNyyPKTUe" name="shokz-openswim-pro-volume-power-buttons.jpg" alt="OpenSwim Pro volume/power buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GwCjWjaautiXEMNyyPKTUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">OpenSwim Pro volume/power buttons also switch modes. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part of this swimming tech is that you don&apos;t need the app to access it. You can simultaneously press the volume down and volume up/power buttons to switch the OpenSwim Pro from Bluetooth to MP3 mode. The controls — the large multifunction button on the front and those volume buttons underneath the right arm of the headband — are just as responsive wet as they are dry. </p><p>Below those volume buttons is the proprietary four-pin magnetic charging port. To keep everything sealed and protected against water ingress, you&apos;ll use pogo pins instead of USB-C.</p>

<p>The fine folks at Shokz also considered the case when it comes to getting wet. It&apos;s wedge-shaped so it can stand up and has drainage holes on the back to accommodate airflow for damp headphones drying. Being upright ensures those drainage holes don&apos;t get blocked.</p><p>Overall, on land, the audio quality from the OpenSwim Pro is really good, with a caveat I&apos;ll get to in a moment. They have excellent sound separation in MP3 mode and Bluetooth mode. You have to remember that you&apos;re using open-ear audio devices, so there&apos;s a level of warmth from the mids and lows that you aren&apos;t going to get like in-ears, but despite that, the audio output is pleasing. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ynefCuDQFNGvYJZu8g5fdS" name="shokz-openswim-pro-wearing-CU2.jpg" alt="Shokz OpenFit Air, and OpenSwim Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynefCuDQFNGvYJZu8g5fdS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t much I take issue with regarding both of these devices, but for the OpenSwim Pro, the bass passed through the bone conduction pads may get annoying for some people and too much for those who are ticklish. It vibrates a lot! Like "PS5 gaming remote haptic feedback" a lot. I think this is a feature that some people will accept but others will hate.</p><p>Sorry to be a wet blanket, triathletes, but I have to mention the inability to use these earbuds in salt water. So, no ocean use for you. If you do happen to purchase the OpenSwim Pros and try them in that deep blue sea, Shokz recommends that you wash them off with fresh water and dry them immediately.</p><p>One other thing I&apos;d like to see on future OpenSwim Pro units is the ability to adjust the neck, or is it a head-band? For me it sits at the base of my skull, so technically, I guess that makes it a headband.</p><p>Despite the new angled design, the OpenFit Air feels "loose," hovering over my ear. For my ear geometry, the OpenFit feels like it sits closer to my ear, but ears are like fingerprints; no two are the same, so your mileage will vary in how they feel on you. </p><p>The last thing you may have an issue with is the case size. It&apos;s a hair larger than the previously released OpenFit, so it is "purse-able," but pocketable? Not really. It&apos;s going to leave quite the imprint sitting in your pockets.</p>

<p>If swimming gear is what you&apos;re looking for, there are actually a few other options on the market, and we have an entire roundup of open-ear earbuds to consider if it&apos;s the OpenFit Air you were curious about. First, let&apos;s talk OpenSwim Pro competitors. The H20 Audio Tri Multi-Sport has a nice, warm bass-heavy sound but, unlike the OpenSwim, only has 8GB of storage for music. They&apos;re $20 less but are only rated for water ingress, not dust, and their controls can be finicky. </p><p>The Zygo Solo takes a novel approach to keeping you in the water and entertained by using an FM radio transmitter, which does a lot better than Bluetooth underwater. The downside is that compared to the OpenSwim Pro&apos;s nine hours of battery life, you&apos;ll get just three hours. Oh, and they&apos;re a lot bigger than the OpenSwim Pro. </p><p>There are a couple of others, but they lack either the battery life, the storage capacity, or the sound quality of the OpenSwim Pro.</p><p>For OpenFit Air competition, the premium upgrade that gives you upgraded sound, a jaw-dropping "Immersive Sound" mode, and better battery life if you don&apos;t use that immersive mode is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open earbuds.</a> These are almost three times the cost, though. You&apos;ll pay $299 ordering them from Amazon. </p><p>1MORE Fit Open Earbuds S50 have a long name and an even longer battery life: 11 hours. They&apos;re IPX7, so no dust ingress rating, and they&apos;ll cost you $10 more. People with smaller ears may experience fit issues with these. </p><p>Anker also offers some competition in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/anker-soundcore-aerofit-review">Soundcore AeroFit Pro</a>, which gives you an impressive 14 hours of playback time and supports LDAC playback. They come with a detachable neckband to shore up the fit for those high-intensity workouts and they sound great at lower volumes.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy OpenFit Air if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want relatively inexpensive open-ear earbuds</li><li>You have concha piercings and in-ears don't fit</li><li>You want open-air earbuds that sound good</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy OpenFit Air if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are a bass lover</li><li>You need more than 6 hours of battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You should buy OpenSwim Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You spend a lot of time in the water</li><li>You want something with great sound submerged</li><li>You want something for surf and turf</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy OpenSwim Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're very ticklish. Seriously.</li><li>You don't like neckband configurations</li><li>You need earbuds that can withstand salt water</li></ul>
<p>If you want a product that will "Wow!" you underwater, the OpenSwim Pro is that product. It has nine hours of battery life (six hours in MP3 mode), is IP68 rated for two hours in the pool at up to six feet deep, and has an MP3 mode with 32GB of storage, making it a hard product to beat in this category. Best of all, Bluetooth 5.4 makes it… not so niche. Despite the potentially ear-tickling bone conduction modules, the OpenSwim Pro is easily recommended for the mermaids and mermen among us (Mer-persons?).</p><p>OpenFit Air has stiff competition in the open-ear market. Still, its light weight, solid sound, IP54 rating, wallet-friendly price point, and good call quality make it a good all-around open-ear earbud for those who need or prefer this design.</p>

I turned to the DiskStation DS1823xs+, and slotted in four 18TB HAT5310 drives alongside an assortment of Seagate Exos and IronWolf drives I&apos;m testing long-term, bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">total storage to 114TB</a>.</p><p>The addition of Seagate&apos;s excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x24-24tb-hdd-review">Exos X24 24TB drive</a> increased the addressable storage to 138TB, and for once, I&apos;m actually ahead of my storage requirements — I don&apos;t see myself filling these drives for at least another year or so. That timing works out well, because in that time, we should start seeing retail availability of Seagate&apos;s next-gen Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) drives.</p>

<p>Most HDDs in the market today use Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) or Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR), and if you&apos;re buying anything that&apos;s 8TB or above, there&apos;s a good chance that it uses CMR. With ever-increasing storage needs, hard drive manufacturers are figuring out ways to maximize data density on a platter; the 24TB Exos X24 uses 10 platters, with each platter able to hold 2.4TB of data.</p><p>When writing data to a CMR drive, the magnetic tracks are arranged side-by-side, so changing data on one track doesn&apos;t affect neighboring tracks. SMR drives, meanwhile, maximize density by overlapping tracks, and this makes the drives more affordable, but affect read/write transfers to a noticeable degree. While high-density SMR drives are used in data centers, they&apos;re not ideal for home use scenarios involving plenty of read/write workloads.</p><p>With HAMR drives, we&apos;re seeing the introduction of 30TB HDDs. That&apos;s a sizeable achievement, and Seagate is already selling a 30TB drive called the Exos Mozaic 3+, albeit to enterprise customers. The drive is built on the Mozaic 3+ platform, and it utilizes a 10-platter design — just like the Exos X24 — but with each platter now containing 3TB of data.</p><p>When storing that much data on a single platter, the individual bits are so tightly packed together that changing one bit has the potential to alter nearby bits. HAMR tech counters this by a novel method: lasers. HAMR drives use a plasmonic metal antenna (a diode laser) that&apos;s attached to each write head, and the laser heats a minuscule section of the disk platter at a time, allowing the write head to change the polarity of the bit — but not others around it. This process takes a nanosecond, and doesn&apos;t otherwise affect the thermal stability of the drive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="caEnShWMMUBoiuazTwynKo" name="seagate-exos-x24-10.jpg" alt="Seagate Exos X24 24TB HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/caEnShWMMUBoiuazTwynKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the way the tech works, only the data in the area targeted by the laser diode is altered, and once it cools, it regains its magnetic coercivity. To achieve this, Seagate is using custom hard drive platters that consist of an iron-platinum alloy and a glass substrate, and as the material has higher coercivity, it is thermally stable until it comes into contact with the laser.</p><p>All of this basically means that we can now get drives with significantly higher areal density, leading to HDDs going up to 70TB and beyond. That&apos;s still some way out, but with Seagate now selling 30TB and 32TB drives based on the Mozaic 3+ platform to data center customers, we don&apos;t need to wait too long before these drives are available to retail buyers.</p><p>There&apos;s the small matter that even if Seagate rolled out 30TB drives to consumers today, there aren&apos;t many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">home NAS servers</a> that can accommodate the drives. Most enclosures go up to 24TB, and it&apos;s going to be a year or two until we start seeing NAS servers that can slot in 30TB and higher-storage drives.</p><p>Even though if you don&apos;t need (or want) 30TB drives, their introduction will reduce prices of current 20TB and 24TB drives, and that&apos;s always welcome. The 24TB Exos X24 is already a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/seagate-exos-x24-st24000nm002h-24tb/p/N82E16822185105">decent bargain at $479</a> considering the amount of storage on offer, but the introduction of higher-density should bring down those figures. I can&apos;t wait.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>It appears that Google's repair policy allows it to retain Pixel devices containing unauthorized parts.</li><li>Similar practices by Samsung suggest a potential industry trend limiting independent repair options.</li><li>Google's policy also discards accessories sent in with Pixels for repair.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent discovery by a YouTuber highlights Google&apos;s sneaky repair policy meant to confiscate your Pixel if it&apos;s got parts the company didn&apos;t approve.</p><p>A recent discovery by YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n4y9mrep9Y" target="_blank">Louis Rossmann</a>, reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-keeps-phones-with-non-oem-parts-3448350/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, revealed a potential point of contention within Google&apos;s service policy. The policy, effective since July 19 of last year, grants Google the right to retain Pixel devices sent in for repair if unauthorized components are discovered. This raises questions regarding consumer choice and repairability within the tech industry.</p><p>The specific clause, as found on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/device-repair/" target="_blank">website</a>, states: "You will not send in a Device containing non-Google-authorized parts – if You do, Your Device will not be returned to you."</p><p>A key caveat within Google&apos;s repair policy pertains to the use of non-authorized components. Individuals who choose to use aftermarket parts for Pixel repairs should be aware that Google reserves the right to retain the device should it be sent in for subsequent repairs containing such parts.</p><p>This policy creates a bit of a clash between your right to fix your own stuff and Google wanting to keep things under their control.</p><p>The recent discovery of Google&apos;s anti-consumer repair policy echoes a similar controversy that surfaced around two weeks ago. Leaked Samsung service contracts revealed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-samsung-contract-user-data-device-disassembly">protocol mandating repair technicians to immediately dismantle and report devices containing non-OEM parts</a>.</p><p>This recurring trend suggests a potential industry-wide practice, raising concerns about consumer choice and restrictions on independent repair options within the mobile tech sector.</p><p>But that&apos;s not all. The document supposedly spilled the tea on a practice that might be a privacy nightmare. Apparently, Samsung wanted repair shops to hand over a ton of customer data in exchange for genuine parts. We&apos;re talking names, phone numbers, IMEI details, and all the juicy details about why the phone needed fixing in the first place.</p><p>Google&apos;s repair policy extends beyond component scrutiny. Any accessories, like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-pixel-8-cases">favorite Pixel 8 cases</a>, adorning your Pixel during its repair journey will likely be relegated to the lost and found bin, assuming your phone even passes the "authorized parts" inspection.</p><p>This throws some shade on Google&apos;s repair practices. The company wasn&apos;t exactly known for sunshine and rainbows before when it came to fixing Pixels, and now this policy adds another layer of frustration.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>Following concerns raised over its anti-consumer repair policy, Google revised its service policy. The company says it will not retain phones for repair due to non-OEM parts.</p><p>"If a customer sends their Pixel to Google for repair, we would not keep it regardless of whether the phone has non-OEM parts or not," a Google spokesperson told Android Central. "In certain situations, we won&apos;t be able to complete a repair such as if there are safety concerns. In that case, we will either send the phone back to the customer or work with them to determine next steps. Customers are also free to seek the repair options that work best for them. We are updating our Terms and Conditions to clarify this."</p>

All he could recall was the tune “hmm, hmm, hiiiim.” While the ability to search for a tune with such vague recollection of the lyrics or rhythm might not yet be on the horizon, you can, in fact, sing or hum a part of a song on YouTube to hopefully locate it.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-song-identification-search-android">new song identification feature</a> works similarly to one that Google already offers in its own app and on Pixel mobile devices.

<p>Provided you have given enough information, ths method to search for a song on YouTube and YouTube Music should work. I tried it multiple times and it was pretty good at identifying tracks both old and new. With YouTube, you can explore a video of the song itself as well as tons of other related content, from covers to interviews with the band, and more. With YouTube Music, you can easily add songs to your playlist. But it isn’t foolproof.</p><p>With YouTube Music, for example, I once got a different version of a track from the one I wanted, but close enough. Another time, it called up a cover of a song versus the actual one. A few times, my 12-year-old son tried, albeit with some more obscure and difficult-to-identify tracks, and it chose the wrong ones.</p><p>Nonetheless, the feature is fun to use. And if you hold up your phone to the actual track that&apos;s playing versus attempting your best Billy Eilish or Ed Sheeran impersonation, the app will almost certainly be able to identify it.</p><p>Note that you can already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-assistant-identify-songs">use Google Assistant to identify songs</a> as well. But this handy new feature further solidifies YouTube Music’s position as one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-music-players-android">the best music player apps for Android</a>.</p>
