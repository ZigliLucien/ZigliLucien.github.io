The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6 is $140 off</strong></a>, while the Watch 7 and Ultra already hit all-time lows. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/c/promotions/holiday-sale-guide-americas/">Garmin Holiday Sale</a> has most of our favorites at $100+ off. Not everything is discounted, but almost all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best watches</a> have been or <em>will</em> be at some point; you don't have to "hunt" for deals; just wait.</p><p>Smart ring discounts are rarer. You can find cheap, unreliable rings on Amazon anytime, but for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> — especially Oura — deals are infrequent <em>and</em> more likely to sell out. Unlike one-size-fits-all smartwatches, smart rings often sell out in certain ring sizes and finishes — especially if you have to wait for a ring sizing kit first.</p><p>At the moment, some of our favorite last-gen smart rings are discounted, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RingConn-Subscription-Activity-Waterproof-Compatible/dp/B0D1456Q8Q"><strong>RingConn Gen 1 for $199 (27% off)</strong></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Horizon-Tracking/dp/B0CSR7G7NX"><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3 for $299 ($50 off)</strong></a>. For the latest and greatest smart rings, though, you'll have to wait until Black Friday, as many of them — like the Oura Ring 4, Samsung Galaxy Ring, and Ultrahuman Ring Air — are full-price and fairly expensive compared to watches.</p>

<p>Amazfit and RingConn have these Black Friday smart ring deals available now for anyone wanting to try a smart ring for cheap without really <em>committing</em> to the idea of wearing one. But by Black Friday, we can hope to see deals on favorites like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> that offer great style, battery life, accuracy, and features.</p><p>There were some solid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitfam-if-you-like-it-you-should-put-a-smart-ring-on-it-before-prime-day-ends">Prime Day smart ring deals</a> last month, and we can only assume they'll dip as low (or even lower) in a couple of weeks. So keep an eye out!</p>
<h2 id="a-smart-ring-won-t-replace-your-smartwatch-it-s-a-luxury-2">A smart ring won't replace your smartwatch; it's a luxury</h2>
<p>If the point of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">Black Friday deals</a> is to splurge on something you normally wouldn't, then a smart ring fits that theme better. People <em>need</em> smartwatches for notifications, workouts, maps, and the like. If you compare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-key-differences">smartwatch vs. smart rings</a>, you'll find they cover a lot of the same ground for features and health tracking.</p><p>So why buy a smart ring? They ensure you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">don't have to wear an uncomfortable watch at night</a> to get 24/7 data on your sleep quality, stress, and heart health; and if you buy the right smart ring, it'll look sleek and stylish doing it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wWGBexAa84bcajKekXViRY" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-1.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWGBexAa84bcajKekXViRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That won't be enough to appeal to everyone, but smart rings have become increasingly popular for a reason. People who prefer non-smart luxury watches to smartwatches can still get the basic health data they want; and since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-wearable-band-market-Q2-2024">basic watches outsold smartwatches this year</a>, I'm guessing there's a lot of you out there who'd benefit from one.</p><p>Smart rings aren't perfect. We've found that they're very accurate for normal at-rest HR data but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-ring-hr-accuracy-test">can struggle with workout results</a>, and while they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">shockingly good at step counting</a> when you're out and about, they tend to generate a lot of false steps when you're just sitting at your desk typing or gesticulating.</p><p>In other words, smart rings are still in their early stages, improving their accuracy and usefulness over time. And since so many companies are trying to establish themselves in the smart ring market, they're all charging a high amount to break even on their R&D.</p><p>That's why Black Friday is the right time to buy one, if you're going to: it's the rare moment when smart rings won't be a bit overpriced for what they can do, so you can jump in on the trend without breaking the bank.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-fitness-bands-vs-smart-rings-2">What about fitness bands vs. smart rings?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PRD4QshXhNpaRNTRvmftEP" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-and-smart-ring.jpeg" alt="The Fitbit Charge 6 and a smart ring next to one another." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRD4QshXhNpaRNTRvmftEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings can't replace smartwatches, but they basically exist to replace cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> or Xiaomi Smart Band 9.</p><p>These devices may have screens for notifications, but in other respects they have few of the smarts of a traditional smartwatch. They're there to track your health and workouts, aligning with smart rings' main purpose.</p><p>Because fitness bands have more space for health sensors and your full wrist instead of a tiny strip of finger skin to work with, they tend to be more accurate for workouts. But like smartwatches, they're less comfortable for sleep tracking and more liable to get dislodged from your wrist by a bad sleep position, while your well-fitted smart ring stays comfortably in place.</p><p>And unlike smartwatches, fitness bands honestly aren't particularly attractive. They're "sporty" at best and cheap-looking at worst, which gives smart rings the edge.</p><p>Still, a fitness tracker lets you check notifications, can buzz you awake without a traditional alarm, and costs significantly less even before Black Friday deals come into play. So if you're more concerned about function than looks, a fitness band may be the better option for you.</p>

However, users ran into issues with their smartwatches after installing the update, with devices stuck on a blank screen and effectively bricking their watches.</p><p>As a result of the problems, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">Google pulled the update</a> as it worked to figure out what was causing the issue. Now, it looks like Google has found a solution, with the Wear OS 5 update arriving alongside the November security patch.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> has also received the November update, but it only brings the new security patch and bug fixes. Additionally, Google has stated that the next update for Pixel smartwatches won't arrive until March 2025, going away from what has been a relatively monthly cadence of updates.</p>

Underneath are huge batteries, with 6,500mAh for the 10 Pro and 7,050mAh for the Pro Plus. Additionally, the Pro supports 60W wired charging while the Pro Plus supports 120W charging, which should help given the massive battery sizes.</p><p>The 10 Pro comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care"></a>storage.

Both phones also come with impressive thermal management and cooling systems to handle all that power.</p><p>The phones are available now in China and will launch internationally on December 3.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a phone that comes with a stylus; you've liked other Motorola phones you've owned in the past; you want a phone with excellent battery life and fast-charging.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer phones offering more than one OS upgrade; you aren't really looking to use a stylus with your phone.</p><p>The 2024 Motorola Moto G Stylus is one of the most impressive mid-range phones we've ever tested, and it's also an obvious pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones#section-best-stylus-phone">best Motorola phone with a stylus</a>. No stylus phone is good without a large, quick screen, which is why this phone benefits so greatly from its 6.7-inch pOLED display and its super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Add in its long battery life, hyper-fast wired charging, wireless charging capability, and its surprisingly impressive cameras for a mid-range phone, and you're looking at a pretty great find for $150 off.</p><p>Performance on the Moto G Stylus is backed by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 and 8GB of RAM, but on a physical level, users go crazy for the vegan leather backing that comes with Motorola phones.</p><p>Like any phone, there are a few downsides to the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G, one being the fact that it's limited to one OS update. Additionally, the in-display fingerprint sensor is cool, but it's a little uncomfortable to reach for in its current location. Regardless, most users won't find a lot of flaws in this device, and especially not when they get it at this price.</p>

<p>The Canadian government is opening the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/federal-government-launching-research-institute-for-ai-safety-1.7107410">Canadian Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute</a>, making it one of the first countries to do so after world leaders agreed at a summit in Seoul last May that a network of publicly funded safety institutes was needed to study and test AI. The center will cost "only" 50 million CAD over five years, with funding to come from the 2.4 billion earmarked for AI funding in the current federal budget.</p><p>I'm in firm agreement that this is a necessity and well worth the cost. Governments often spend too much money and bog down good ideas in red tape and bureaucracy, but the alternative of allowing the likes of Google and OpenAI to determine what's best will only lead to more profits, not what's best for the public at large. Something must be done because AI is worth doing right and can bring about more improvements than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">smartphone gimmicks</a>.</p>
<p>Canada's Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne says it succinctly:</p><p><em>"If you want people to adopt it, they need to have trust. If there's no adoption, we will squander the incredible potential of many new technologies."</em></p>
<p>This is an idea the United States — and most other countries with enough resources — needs to clone. I'd suggest going a step further and adding a cabinet position for a true Czar of AI and Future Technologies, but everything starts with small steps. AI is not going away, and allowing the tech to explode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-fight-against-ai-scammers-why-it-matters" target="_blank">without proper guidelines</a> and, dare I say, laws that govern its use is a dangerous and stupid idea.</p><p>There are countless small or individual state-funded groups that study AI and its "proper" use cases, but a centralized department that oversees and coordinates costly studies and research would be beneficial. Simply put, a country that does not take this technology seriously will play second fiddle to the countries that do.</p>
<p>With a new presidential administration, changes to what we are currently doing — not much aside from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">a Biden Executive Order</a> — are coming. President-elect Trump hasn't expressed much interest in any AI governance aside from abolishing said E.O. but there is a very good chance that we will see something that looks into the future and "proper" use of AI thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-senate-thune-cornyn-scott.html">incoming Senate Majority</a> Leader John Thune.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.13%;"><img id="8Y7nqcC8NC2AAzSCUweVaC" name="us-capitol-bldg.jpg" alt="Us Capitol Bldg" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Y7nqcC8NC2AAzSCUweVaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="505" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: US Park Service)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thune is, by all accounts, a conservative with very right-leaning views when it comes to regulations. However, the senior senator from South Dakota is familiar with the pros and cons of AI legislation from his time on the Commerce Committee and is not afraid to oppose Trump's agenda. He even cosponsored the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3312/text"><em>Artificial Intelligence Research, Innovation, and Accountability Act</em></a><em> </em>with Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) to promote more transparency and risk assessment of AI's use. He sounds like he understands that AI can't be set free or that having the technology overseen by the same companies building it is a bad idea.</p>
<p>This is also a case where the right's obsession with China can be beneficial. China can — and will — go all-in with AI to stave off a looming economic collapse if it thinks it can help. And it certainly can. AI can be a boon to manufacturing, agriculture, the energy sector, and, of course, defense when used properly. U.S. lawmakers have a responsibility to not allow any country, especially one that is the main global competitor in almost every way, to gain an advantage because the U.S. simply didn't try to compete. When that country is China, lawmakers will see it as a badge of courage or some other nonsense to do their job. As AI-focused bills "to fight China" are introduced, Thune will make sure they get their fair share of time in front of the Senate.</p><p>Canada may be looking at AI with increased scrutiny because it's best for Canadians. The U.S. would also do it because it somehow fights "the Chinese Communist Regime." I'm OK with that in this case, and you should be, too.</p>
<p>Expect to see other countries open similar state-sponsored AI study centers in 2025 as well as smaller international institutes doing their own research. As mentioned, world leaders agree it's necessary. Normally, with an incoming U.S. administration that is focused on maximizing corporate profit at any expense I'd not add the USA to that list, but a few details and circumstances make me optimistic.</p><p>If we don't find a way to regulate AI, it will forever remain a mixture of parlor tricks for your phone or a way for someone to scam you out of your money while the rest of the world flourishes.</p>

It's just something so obvious that it's almost comical to see Google contend it's not a Nest Hub replacement. Especially considering that the Pixel Tablet 2 is still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Tin-foil hat time. Maybe the Pixel Tablet is<em> actually</em> a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">Nest Hub replacement</a>, but Google wanted to put it into the wild disguised as a tablet with a detachable speaker dock. I mean, it makes perfect sense when you consider that the Speaker Dock is useless if the tablet isn't docked.</p><p>Then, there's the whole "Where's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a>" thing, which still has me scratching my head, given that Google released SO MANY devices this summer. The only things missing were new Nest speakers and an updated tablet. Everything else got revamped in one way or another.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FcJ45yEJ5Fu6xYopeJU4jn" name="tshaka_hub max v pixel tab.jpg" alt="nest hub max vs pixel tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FcJ45yEJ5Fu6xYopeJU4jn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wasn't until a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2-accessory-prototype-rumors">report</a> from Mishaal Rahman over at Android Authority helped the light bulb go off. Supposedly, Google is "working on" its next tablet, which "might" include a keyboard case. Where have I heard this before? Oh right. Google was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-relaunch-accessories-rumored">rumored to release</a> a keyboard case for the current Pixel Tablet, but I assume those days are long gone.</p><p>Google didn't <em>want</em> the Pixel Tablet to be a productivity tool, even with the display supporting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">USI 2.0 standard</a>. It's a nicety, but not a necessity, and definitely not something I suspect many people actually make use of. It would also help explain why the Pixel Tablet has such a boring and muted design, to go along with the LCD panel sporting those <em>thicc</em> bezels.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-this-work-2">How would this work?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So here's what I think <em>could</em> happen. The Pixel Tablet 2 is announced, complete with all (or at least many) of the bells and whistles for us productivity nerds out there. That means an upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, keyboard case, USI stylus, and perhaps even an OLED display with a faster refresh rate.</p><p>After that, Google debuts its revamped Nest speaker and display lineup, complete with a brand new Nest Hub Max. But it's not actually a new Nest Hub Max. It's just a rebranded Pixel Tablet, detachable screen and all!</p><p>But what about the regular Nest Hub?</p><p>Well, what device has a smaller display than the Nest Hub Max and Pixel Tablet but is bigger than a slab phone? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>! Of course, this imaginary Nest Hub wouldn't have a screen that folds in half, but it is more compact than the current generation while also looking quite a bit more modern.</p><p>I'm not exactly sure which of these would come first. But that's for Google to figure out.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-era-for-google-maybe-2">A new era for Google, maybe</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oCnTTS3eWJdJdcgbjv6mr9" name="google-tv-streamer-pixel-9-pro-pixel-watch-3-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Pixel Watch 3, Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCnTTS3eWJdJdcgbjv6mr9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If things play out the way I described, then after the dust settles, the Pixel Tablet 2 drops the deuce and is just the "Pixel Tablet" or even "Pixel Tablet (2nd Generation)." Kind of like how Apple's iPad Pro is not actually "iPad Pro 6 12.9" but is "iPad Pro 12.9 (6th Generation)."</p><p>The "New" Pixel Tablet (2nd Generation) gives Google a competitor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, and iPad. The revamped Nest Hub manages to get everyone excited about using Gemini in the home, especially when paired with the new Nest Thermostat and Google TV Streamer.</p><p>I don't even think this scenario is too far-fetched, but until Google makes its next move, I'm just going to continue wondering what in the world it has planned. Or maybe these are just the ramblings of a sleep-deprived tech nerd who attempts to think outside of the box. It's probably the latter.</p>

<ul><li>Google is adding Imagen 3 support to Google Docs for paid Gemini in Workspace users.</li><li>The feature will allow users to generate custom inline images that can be used anywhere in their Google Doc — without leaving the site.</li><li>Google Docs previously supported generating full-bleed cover images, but not inline images.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is leveraging its latest image generation model, Imagen 3, to bring custom images to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-new-feature-is-your-go-to-tool-for-wrangling-those-giant-documents">Google Docs</a>, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/use-gemini-in-google-docs-to-create-images.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> today. The company calls these images "photorealistic," and they could be a replacement for stock images in some situations. However, in order to create your own images with Imagen 3 in Google Docs, you'll need to be a paid Workspace user or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> subscriber.</p><p>Before the rollout of Imagen 3 in Docs, Google was already experimenting with image generation in Workspace. It first added support for generating full-bleed cover images in Google Docs and image generation in Google Slides. Now, there's support in Google Docs for unabridged inline image generation. A quick prompt is all it takes to create a cover or in-text image, as you can see in the example from Google below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.25%;"><img id="LLEdv4aSVGMqqL9frJ29JZ" name="gemini-createacoverimage" alt="The new image generation capabilities in Google Workspace." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLEdv4aSVGMqqL9frJ29JZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="747" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">Imagen 3</a> in Google Docs, navigate to the <strong>Insert </strong>menu and click <strong>Image</strong> or <strong>Cover image</strong>. Then, select <strong>Help me create an image</strong>. From there, you can use a text prompt to help Imagen 3 create the image you're looking for, and manually choose a style to further refine your prompt. After your image is created, you can pick from three aspect ratios to find the one that best suits your document.</p><p>For now, cover images are only supported when viewing Google Docs in what the company calls "pageless mode." This makes the custom AI-generated image cover the entire document. To activate it, navigate to <strong>File > Page setup > Pageless or Format > Switch to Pageless format</strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately, text-to-image generation in Google Docs isn't available for free users. Users of Gemini Business, Gemini Enterprise, Gemini Education, or Gemini Education Premium will be able to use it. Additionally, individual Workspace users subscribed to Google One AI Premium have access. It's rolling out now, but can take some time to show up for all users, especially if your school or work uses a scheduled release timeline.</p>

However, Samsung did update this in the Watch 7, giving it the coveted dual-band GPS hardware for peak accuracy, and it also upgraded multiple other sensors in the 2024 release.</p>

<p>Samsung’s next batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> is anticipated to launch early next year. However, new information from multiple sources confirms that the Korean tech giant might aim for a later January launch date.</p><p>Firstly, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fnnews.com/ampNews/202411141109523375">Korean media outlet</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-may-descend-on-this-january-day-without-4th-variant/">SamMobile</a>) has noted that the Unpacked event will be held on January 23, 2025—not similar to what we saw in the Galaxy S24 series launch, which was on January 17.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">22.1<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1857001999218188624">November 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The upcoming Unpacked event is believed to be held in San Francisco, U.S. However, another reliable tipster, Max Jambor on X, noted that it might be on January 22, 2025 — a day earlier than the aforementioned predicted date.</p><p>Regardless of both the hinted dates, the launch date of the Galaxy S25 series isn’t drastically different from the predecessor models. Previous rumors of an early launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung flagships</a> didn’t turn out to be accurate. However, there could still be a possibility of shuffling these launch dates as we approach them in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>As the publication notes, Samsung launched the Galaxy S23 series in San Francisco in 2023, and the successors were introduced in San Jose. It is likely that the company will bring the next flagship phones to San Francisco again, alongside its home ground.</p><p>As we near the anticipated launch, we expect the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra to be unveiled at the Unpacked event. Earlier reports have also hinted that a new Galaxy S25 Slim might also be in the works. This device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-slim-galaxy-s25-might-be-samsungs-answer-to-apples-rumored-thin-iphone-17">is expected</a> to debut in the second quarter of 2025 and not alongside the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the Galaxy S25 Slim is believed to be a thinner variant of the flagship lineup to take on Apple’s rumored iPhone 17 “Air,” which is also slated to launch next year. The rumor mill also hints that the expected Galaxy S25 Slim could be some kind of a pilot program from Samsung, which will have a test run next year. If it all goes well, users can expect the successor for the masses, likely with the Galaxy S26 series the following year.</p>

<ul><li>Users have taken to Reddit to report an apparent stable, server-side rollout of dual SIM support for RCS chats in Google Messages.</li><li>Reports claim support has arrived for varying carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T, Visible, and more, though not everyone has seen it yet.</li><li>Google was first spotted moving such support into beta earlier this year, letting users quickly swap connections between SIM cards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A wave of reports claim that Google's dual SIM support for RCS chats in the Messages app is starting to roll out.</p><p>Users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gedpvv/dual_rcs_support_enabled/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">taken to Reddit</a> to report that Google Messages has started pushing its dual SIM for RCS support to stable users/versions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/dual-sim-rcs-starts-appearing-for-some-in-us/">Android Police</a>). One user in the U.S. states that they've started noticing support appear within the app's RCS settings. Another user confirmed as much, stating no notification was given about its arrival in the app.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gqs4si/just_got_dual_sim_rcs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">separate thread</a> in the app's subreddit states a user received dual SIM support on a Pixel 9 Pro XL. The user states they are in the U.S. and have U.S. Mobile and Visible. However, some users are having a more troubling experience with the app's dual SIM RCS support. One user in the Google Messages beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gedpvv/comment/lujud3i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">hasn't yet received the feature</a>, stating they have two SIMs from Verizon.</p><p>Another report confirmed additional issues, which could point to an ongoing rollout on Google's side. Users claim that clearing data and Play Services has done nothing to produce the feature. So, it's probably best if users wait for Google to flip the switch.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1gedpvv/dual_rcs_support_enabled">Dual RCS support enabled!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Elsewhere, the publication states that users have noticed the dual SIM support for RCS chats appear in v20241018_01_RC00 of the beta. The post adds that reports from other users say they've received proper support with SIMs from T-Mobile, AT&T, and Google Fi in conjunction with those previously mentioned.</p><p>Google was first tipped to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-support-for-dual-sim-rcs">dual SIM support for RCS-enabled chats</a> early this year. Similar to how users see it today, the app will display two checkboxes within its RCS settings. Each box will showcase the name of the SIM card's cellular network and its current status. Naturally, for RCS, the app will need to run through its verification steps. Once you're good and green, users can easily toggle their SIM card connection.</p><p>Google seemingly teased this in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/7189714">support document</a>, stating, "RCS chats are available for your default or preferred call SIM at this time and may be available for other SIMs later." However, with the rollout appearing fragmented, it's still taking time.</p><p>A more recent Google Messages beta showed the company might shift its UI elements — specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-read-receipts-placement-redesign-spotted">its read receipts</a>. Users might soon find them implemented alongside a user's text, instead of directly beneath.</p>

Join the Verizon-owned wireless carrier before December 2nd and type in the <strong>code SAVE24</strong> during checkout and you&apos;ll be guaranteed to receive two years of coverage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><strong>as little as $20 per month for the base plan or $35 per month for Visible Plus</strong></a>. Only new members are eligible for the deal, but that&apos;s basically where the fine print ends.  </p>

<p>Sign up for Visible and use the code SAVE24 during checkout and you'll get discounted wireless for two years, no strings attached. The deal knocks $5 off the base plan every month while Visible Plus users will get $10 shaved off their phone bill every month for 24 months.
