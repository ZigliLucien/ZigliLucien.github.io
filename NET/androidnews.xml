<p>Just like Amazon, the iconic tech company is selling the 75-inch model with a $700 discount, but Samsung is also challenging its rival by throwing in a FREE S-Series Dolby Atmos soundbar (a $349.99 value). The deal ends at midnight tonight, so don't wait too long if you're interested!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/the-frame/75-class-the-frame-qled-4k-ls03d-qn75ls03dafxza/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ef1ad277-0f2b-491f-8f36-05ecad33e0a6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung 75" The Frame 4K QLED TV: $2,999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung 75" The Frame 4K QLED TV: $2,999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Frame boasts stunning 4K QLED picture with Samsung&apos;s AI-powered Quantum Processor 4K, but the main selling point here is the TV&apos;s ability to double as a lovely work of art in your home. The sleek display features an anti-glare matte finish with a slim construction that hangs flush against your wall, plus you get to customize the bezel so The Frame matches the decor of your home.</p><p>If you want an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV</a> that offers peak, cinema-quality entertainment without interfering with the style of your living room, then The Frame is pretty groundbreaking. $700 off the 75-inch set was already a good deal, but with a free soundbar thrown into the mix, it&apos;s truly unmissable.</p>

But when Thinborne came around a few years ago, the company&apos;s ultra-thin and light aramid fiber cases totally changed my mind.</p><p>You can also enjoy Thinborne&apos;s best cases for <strong>35% off</strong> during Amazon Big Deals Day, also known as October Prime Day, by putting the special code <strong>AC2024PRIME</strong> in at checkout when you select any of these Thinborne cases for your favorite phone.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You hate cases that add weight and bulk to your sleek phone or ruin the look by making it clunky. Thinborne cases are light and thin — many even add MagSafe magnetic rings on the back — helping to add grip and scratch protection to keep your phone looking new.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You tend to drop your phone a lot. Thinborne cases are best for adding grip and scratch resistance but won&apos;t protect a phone against regular drops the way the company&apos;s Caseborne cases do.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I don&apos;t normally use a case is because I don&apos;t drop my phone. But life happens and there are plenty of times that a phone can fall out of a bag or pocket, slide off a table, or otherwise end up somewhere you don&apos;t want it to go.</p><p>I love Thinborne cases because they add a substantial layer of grip to the phone without adding bulk. The aramid fiber material looks and feels amazing to hold, often making a phone feel better than with no case at all.</p><p>It also helps protect against scratches that can happen at any time, especially if you have your naked phone in a car or somewhere else where it might slide. After all, most phones are slabs of metal and glass, so it doesn&apos;t take much for a phone to slide across any surface and get an annoying scratch.</p>

<p>But if you are someone who tends to drop your phone every so often, never fear! Thinborne&apos;s sister company, Caseborne, designs cases for people who need more protection for their device or want something special like a belt holster.</p><p>My personal favorite pick of this group is the clear case with a MagSafe ring — pictured above — which provides good protection while showing off the color of your phone and still remaining fairly minimalist.</p><p>Caseborne cases are also <strong>35% off</strong> when using the code <strong>AC2024PRIME</strong> at checkout on Amazon.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is our favorite Samsung foldable to date, featuring an updated, more book-like design that makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">writing with the S Pen</a> feel even better than on previous generations.

That means you&apos;ll be getting updates all the way through Android 21. That&apos;s a <em>really</em> long time and substantially adds to the value of the phone!</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 will no longer get any software or security updates according to a Samsung support website.</li><li>The most recent security update for the phone is from August 2024. Its last OS update was Android 13 with One UI 5.1.1 in August 2023.</li><li>Samsung is still offering $600 to trade the phone in if you upgrade, and many other sales for foldable phones are happening through the end of Prime Day on October 9, 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 has finally received its last security update, signaling the end of life for the famed foldable. Last year, the Z Fold 2 got its final Android update to Android 13 with One UI 5.1.1, and now August 2024’s security update will be the last the phone ever sees.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb">Samsung support website</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/08/no-more-updates-for-galaxy-z-fold-2-tab-a7/">9to5Google</a>) that shows the list of actively supported phones, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 will no longer receive any more software updates.</p><p>Companies like Google and Samsung have significantly upgraded their update promises over the last year, with both companies now offering an incredible seven year guarantee for OS and security updates. While OS updates are nice to get since they deliver new features, security updates are the vitally important ones since they protect users from software vulnerabilities that come with being connected to the internet.</p><p>Since the Galaxy Z Fold 2 will no longer receive any security updates, it’s important that all Z Fold 2 owners upgrade to a new phone as soon as possible. Newer phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> offer big camera upgrades, significantly smaller hinges, flat folding, water and dust resistance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">support for the S Pen</a>, and seven more years of software updates.</p><p>Thankfully, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is on sale at Samsung.com for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-512gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakexaa/"><strong>record low price of $1269</strong></a> for the 512GB model. That&apos;s double the storage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0D18VM66K/">$500-off Amazon sale</a>, and you can even trade your Galaxy Z Fold 2 into Samsung for a bigger discount. Plus, Samsung has exclusive colors and finishes when you buy it there.</p>

<p>While it makes the most sense for some customers to stick with Samsung and upgrade to a Galaxy Z Fold 6, the foldable market is so much better than it used to be back when the Z Fold 2 was shiny and new.</p><p>For example, the best folding phone you can buy today is the OnePlus Open which packs in a substantially faster processor than the Z Fold 2, far better cameras, and wider displays that are significantly more eye-friendly than Samsung’s AMOLED panels.</p><p>It’s also got more ram and a better multitasking experience thanks to OnePlus’s ingenious Canvas design which lets you juggle between multiple apps at a time with simple gestures, making it feel more like a laptop than a phone when open. Better yet, it’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad/dp/B0CHN8FNW3/"><strong>$200 cheaper than the Galaxy Z Fold 6</strong></a>, coming in at $1,139.99 during today’s final Prime Day sale.</p><p>If you’d rather go a bit smaller this time around, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is our favorite flip phone of all time, packing amazing battery life into a svelte frame that folds in half and fits in any pocket or bag. It’s also got a better, more eye-friendly display than the Z Fold 2, a faster processor, and a cover screen experience that’ll have you unfolding the phone less than you might expect to. It’s also on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-razr-Unlocked-Camera-Midnight/dp/B0D23P28XX/"><strong>$240 off</strong></a> during today’s Prime Day sale, so jump on that if you can.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> has long been in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> list thanks to its superb blend of features and price. It might not be able to do a few of the new AI tricks that the Pixel 9 series can, but with seven years of software updates and superb cameras, this crazy-good Prime Day deal makes it the best option under $500 which you shouldn&apos;t miss.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 is still an excellent Android phone one year later, and it's at an all-time low with this superb Prime Day deal of just $449 for the 128GB variant. This base model is a steal if you mostly rely on the cloud to store your files.</p>
<p>It lacks some of the latest specs found in the Pixel 9 series, but it has its fair share of AI wizardry, excellent cameras, premium build quality, and a bright 120Hz OLED display. As we enter day two of Big Deal Days, this is one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2024-dollar400-off-the-pixel-9-pixel-watch-discounts-and-more">Pixel deals</a> to beat.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGTKM9WC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ebef0970-9a70-41b9-a944-51aee7744703" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You&apos;re okay with 128GB of local storage; you need flagship cameras; you want more than five years of software updates.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a gaming-grade processor; you already have a Pixel 8a; you need very fast charging speeds.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a has been our go-to recommendation as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best Android phone under $500</a>, but the Pixel 8 trumps it with this stellar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Day</a> deal. It&apos;s hard to find anything better at $449 if your priority is having a great set of cameras and long-term software updates. Google will eventually phase this phone out, which would explain this rock-bottom deal price, so why not make the most of the opportunity? </p><p>The Pixel 8 has its share of limitations like there&apos;s no telephoto camera, so all zoom shots will be digital only (albeit, still better than most phones). Also, Google&apos;s Tensor processor hasn&apos;t been the best at intense activities like competitive gaming. But if you can live with a couple of these shortcomings, you&apos;ll find the Pixel 8 has a lot to love like its IP68 rating, bright and crisp 6.2-inch display, compact and comfortable size, and strong 5G support for all the major U.S. carriers.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-series-launch">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ was launched only a year ago</a> back in October 2023. comes with expandable storage in the form of a microSD slot. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> also sports four stereo speakers for loud and crisp audio. It isn&apos;t the most powerful tab in the world, but it&apos;s definitely good enough for everyday moderate use.</p><p>Camera specs are so-so, with an 8MP main camera and a 5MP selfie snapper. A device like this isn&apos;t made for photography, however, so you can let that slide. It comes with Android 13 out of the box, which can be upgraded to Android 14 right away. Samsung&apos;s tablet OS lets you use multiple windows, which is great for productivity.</p><p>The 15W charging speed is nothing to write home about, but the battery is generous, to say the least. You get a gigantic 7,040mAh cell in the Galaxy Tab A9+. This should easily last you a few days with light use. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is a great starter tablet for kids or teenagers.</p>

Sure, you could pay $100 more and get the newer Sony XM5s (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH"><strong>currently 25% off</strong></a>) before the sale ends, but I&apos;d just as soon recommend the older headphones for most casual listeners. The differences between the two models are negligible in most cases, and at this price, the XM4s are a steal.</p>

<p>We've entered the second day of October Prime Day, which means you're running out of time to take advantage of all the best deals. If you're in the market for a new pair of wireless headphones, allow me to recommend my beloved Sony WH-1000XM4.</p>
<p>These stylish headphones boast up to 30 hours of battery life with excellent noise cancellation and highly-customizable EQ settings in the companion app. Although I wouldn't pay full price for them at this point, the current 43% discount makes them an incredible value. The only catch is that you'll need to buy the Blue version to receive the savings!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MVGF24M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="64b5e74b-527d-4b44-8dc2-8a82965d8eb0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$348" data-dimension48="$348">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Before any audiophiles come after me, I want to be clear: I listen to just about every genre of music under the sun — from ambient jazz and Chicago drill to folk and doom metal — and while I admit that the XM4s may not be the absolute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> that money can buy, they remain an outstanding choice if you prioritize bang for the buck. </p><p>The sound quality is consistently warm and balanced, and the customizable EQ and active noise cancellation (ANC) mean that I can finely tune my listening experience throughout the day. The XM4s will also last up to 30 hours on a single charge, even with ANC activated, and they recharge quickly when they do finally run out of juice. You can also connect your headphones with two devices simultaneously, which is a nice perk when working from home. </p><p>Some folks feel that the Sony XM4s sound a bit muted and bass-heavy when compared with the newer XM5s, but I&apos;ve never been bothered by it. I also don&apos;t use my headphones when making phone calls, but some have reported sounding a bit muffled when they use the XM4&apos;s built-in microphones. </p><p>In other words, if you&apos;re a serious audiophile or you need a premium pair of wireless headphones for making phone calls throughout your day, the more-expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> may be the better choice. But if you simply enjoy listening to music and don&apos;t mind warmer, more bass-heavy tones, this 43% discount on the Sony WH-1000XM4 is an opportunity that I wouldn&apos;t miss. </p>

I finally feel like Google has figured it out, and here’s why I think switching to an Android device has never been so easy, seamless, and exciting.</p><p>Before diving into my experience and why I recently switched over, I want to remind you that while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 Pro</a> isn&apos;t on sale for Prime Day at Amazon, plenty of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2024-dollar400-off-the-pixel-9-pixel-watch-discounts-and-more" target="_blank">Pixel devices are </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2024-dollar400-off-the-pixel-9-pixel-watch-discounts-and-more" target="_blank">on sale right now</a>. And if you don’t want the latest phone, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/unbelievable-the-google-pixel-8-pro-just-crashed-to-a-record-low-price-for-prime-big-deal-days" target="_blank">also opt for this Pixel 8 Pro Prime Day sale</a>, which I highly recommend.</p><p>Now, I know you’re going to try to chastise me and say, “How come the EIC of Android Central uses an iPhone as her primary device?” I’ve heard it all before, and if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/twitter-for-iphone-vs-twitter-for-android-stop-chastising-people-for-it-heres-why" target="_blank">want to read about my thoughts on that,</a> you can do so here.</p><p>As a journalist and the EIC of any tech publication, it’s essential to know about all phones. That means understanding both operating systems and what both sides of the argument have to offer.</p><p>Up until Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> of devices, I’ve always felt that Google lacked... <em>something</em>. It just never clicked for me. I felt like the phones weren’t ready for me to switch over to. Frankly, none of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android brands</a> have ever appealed to me to switch over permanently. I think it also was that perhaps Apple didn’t make it easy to switch over to.</p><p>This all changed when Google launched its new devices with a new processor, better cameras, and more seamless AI integration. It also helped that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">iPhone 16</a> did not excite me when it was announced. That said, I have yet to test out my iPhone 16, so perhaps that opinion might change.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-really-care-about-blue-and-green-bubbles-2">Should you really care about blue and green bubbles?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the major considerations I had before switching was asking how much I really care about blue bubbles, and the answer to that is <em>not at all</em>. The only person I actually used iMessage with was my husband, and it would usually be to remind him to get something from the grocery store.</p><p>I typically use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">every other messaging platform</a> other than iMessage, so when thinking about this topic, it really wasn&apos;t a major issue.</p><p>That being said, you should think deeply about why it matters if you’re on iMessage or not. Is it an ego thing? Do you think you’ll be shunned and, in turn, have your pride hurt? For those of you who use iMessage, does it matter to you if someone else doesn’t? Because if that’s the case, I think it’s time to consider an alternative thought process.</p><p>All About Cookies, an informational website that provides tips, advice, and recommendations to help you with online privacy and digital security, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://allaboutcookies.org/apple-vs-android"><u>published a really interesting survey</u></a> of 1,000 people and their thoughts on blue vs. green bubbles.</p><p>Seventy-eight percent of iPhone users said they did not think less of people if they had a green bubble when they texted them. Furthermore, 42% of iPhone users rely on other third-party apps like WhatsApp. Not to mention, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">now that iPhones support RCS</a>, messaging with Android users has never been better.</p>
<h2 id="a-robust-smart-home-ecosystem-2">A robust smart home ecosystem</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WBMHNDUUBxEdn7HKN7iaS9" name="nest-wifi-pro-review-ducks-in-a-row.jpg" alt="Nest Wifi Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WBMHNDUUBxEdn7HKN7iaS9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the blue bubble was something I thought about, one of the main considerations I had in switching over was Google’s robust smart home ecosystem.</p><p>My home currently has the Google Wifi AC1200 Mesh Wi-Fi System (which is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GG9CMLR">on sale for Prime Day</a>, as is the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCQSYPZB/">Nest Wifi Pro</a>). I also have the Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review" target="_blank">Nest Doorbell</a> and the Nest Thermostat, and we have a bunch of Nest speakers around the house.</p><p>While my iPhone 15 did have easy access to Google Home, it just made sense for me to switch to a Pixel for that seamless connectivity.</p><p>I think Google got it right with its smart home products and newer phones, which is a pretty stark contrast to Apple’s pretty barebones selection of first-party smart home devices. Google’s products look like a cohesive collection of devices. You can have them all the same color or mix and match. But everything looks beautiful, and it was just exciting to have everything be Google in my home.</p><p>I was basically halfway there, and my smart home setup pushed me to fill the gap by switching over.</p>
<h2 id="the-iphone-15-is-a-gateway-phone-2">The iPhone 15 is a gateway phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ziXkZUAr5KCbBjhiciF5RR" name="iphone-15-pro-max-usb-c.jpg" alt="A USB-C cable and an iPhone 15 Pro Max on a wooden table, showcasing the iPhone's USB Type-C port." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziXkZUAr5KCbBjhiciF5RR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the iPhone is a completely different phone from the Pixel. However, I noticed that I did not struggle as much with switching to an Android device for several reasons.</p><p>I think the first main thing I will note is that, to me, Google’s Pixel is the iPhone of the Android ecosystem. It’s the phone that has the least amount of bloatware, comes with the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> suite (which I already used), and is simple to use. </p><p>More importantly, because the iPhone now has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a>, it was way easier not to worry about buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">new cables</a>; everything in my home was already USB-C. Android Central&apos;s managing editor Derrek Lee pointed this out when the iPhone 15 first launched, noting how it was a smart move that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/usb-c-iphone-15-could-tempt-android-users">could make it easier to get Android users to switch</a>. I just took that and went in the opposite direction.</p><p>While some people might complain that MagSafe isn’t on a Pixel, I never used it on my iPhone and never found it that exciting, so, like iMessage, it’s just another thing I won’t miss.</p>
<h2 id="google-sets-the-standard-for-phones-with-ai-2">Google sets the standard for phones with AI</h2>
<p>Google got it right with its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features on the Pixel 9 series, many of which are already available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>. Google has had two years to enhance Gemini, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-you-probably-should-not-mind-iphone-16-complaints">Apple is still developing Apple AI</a>. In fact, the iPhone 16 didn’t even come with any of the announced Apple Intelligence features at launch.</p><p>I’m not going to sit here and rag on Apple because I will always be a big Apple fan. I still use a MacBook, and I plan on using an iPhone 16, especially to test out its AI features.</p><p>I also plan to go a little bit more indepth with some of the app features I have enjoyed and camera features on the Pixel later on. But I have to say, using my Pixel has been one of the best experiences I have had and I have truly been enjoying it.</p><p>And if you&apos;re considering doing the same, you should definitely try it out. </p>
