It has been four years since Google announced a "flagship" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming device</a>, the Chromecast with Google TV (4K). Now, Google is trying to work its way back into the fight with the all-new Google TV Streamer.</p><p>Instead of the plug-and-play solution that the Chromecast and Fire TV Stick offer, Google opted for a completely different approach. Part of this is due to Google attempting to improve its image while also trying to provide a more premium experience for its customers.</p>

<p>The Google TV Streamer was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">announced</a> and made available for pre-order on August 6 alongside the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). It was subsequently released on September 24, coming in either Hazel or Porcelain, and retails for $99.99. You can currently purchase the TV Streamer from a variety of retailers, including Best Buy, Target, and others, or directly from Google.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ahMBitYAHEBAKTKLodnYBi" name="google-tv-streamer-review-34-16x9.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ahMBitYAHEBAKTKLodnYBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No matter how you look at it, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/why-the-google-tv-streamer-is-more-important-than-you-think">Google TV Streamer</a> is a sleek and well-designed device. It sports the same soft-touch finish found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast</a>, which extends to the color-matched (and new) Voice Remote.</p><p>Since this isn't just a dongle that hangs out of sight, it was important to provide a sleek design that won't stick out like a sore thumb. I think that Google nailed it here, as the TV Streamer has looked pretty darn great in both my home office and on the TV stand in my living room.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yYFevuVxe3frHHjPf5XvAU" name="google-tv-streamer-rear-ports.jpg" alt="Rear ports on the Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yYFevuVxe3frHHjPf5XvAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm also a big fan of the trio of ports found on the back. We have a Gigabit Ethernet jack, along with HDMI 2.1, and the USB-C port provides both data and power, which is rather important. There's also a small button that can be used to find your remote, another benefit of the TV Streamer. I've only had to use this once so far, but it was nice not needing to lift up my couch in a frantic search after my son decided to put it in his bin of toys.</p><p>In general, I don't really have much to say about the actual Google TV experience from a streaming standpoint. Almost all of my streaming apps are available, and with the upgraded 32GB of storage, I can sideload apps without much worry.</p>

<p>So far, my favorite feature of the TV Streamer has been the various smart home implementations that have been made. The Home Panel has been a dream, letting me turn off lights in a room, lock the front door, or adjust the thermostat without needing to get up.</p><p>As such, I was excited to swap out my Ring Doorbell for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review">Nest Doorbell</a>, only to find out that <em>something</em> happened to the Nest, making it unusable. Even still, I can also keep an eye on my dog while she's lounging on the porch courtesy of the Nest Cam mounted on the back corner of my house.</p><p>All of that is great, especially for my wife, but the TV Streamer brings two things in particular that are more exciting to me — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter#section-what-is-thread">Thread</a> support. More specifically, the TV Streamer doubles as a Thread border router, so I don't need to worry about getting OEM-specific accessories when I want to upgrade my smart home gear.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Technically, you can add the TV Streamer to Apple HomeKit, but I don't recommend it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A surprising discovery was that I could even add the TV Streamer to the Apple Home app. But it doesn't show up or operate as a streaming device, instead appearing as a series of switches. So while we're one step closer to the dream, it's obvious that we aren't there just yet.</p><p>Now onto a rather niche use case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YFbWonPbQGcRNDiUx9v6jf" name="google-tv-streamer-with-usb-c-hub-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with DockCase USB-C Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFbWonPbQGcRNDiUx9v6jf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something I rather enjoy doing with my streaming devices is attempting to turn them into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything">retro gaming boxes</a>. The easy part is getting RetroArch installed and set up, but storage has almost always been the Achilles heel. The 32GB of storage on the Google TV Streamer is plenty for the majority of people, but I wanted more.</p><p>They say that the third time's the charm, as that's how many different USB-C hubs I had to try before finding one that would recognize my thumb drive. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/dockcase-smart-usb-c-hub-10-in-1-explorer-edition-review">Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub</a> is definitely overkill for the situation, but since it was the first one that worked, it's the one I've stuck with. Although I'll probably try and find a different one so that I can put this back in my backpack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hswgtRku3tkVgCQCyc8yYZ" name="google-tv-streamer-review-retroarch-1.jpg" alt="RetroArch on the Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hswgtRku3tkVgCQCyc8yYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After plugging the USB-A thumb drive into the Dockcase USB-C Hub and plugging that into the TV Streamer, everything worked just as you'd expect. The 64GB of extra storage was immediately recognized, so I fired up RetroArch and started messing around.</p><p>For the most part, this offers decent performance, but there have been a few hiccups that I'll cover a bit later. Nevertheless, I can't get over how much fun it is being able to fire up RetroArch with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-to-unlock-stadia-controller-bluetooth">Stadia controller</a> and play those classic retro games.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-tv-streamer-what-you-won-t"><span>Google TV Streamer: What you won't</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KxGzsEQrWLgKbUfCsHJy7F" name="google-tv-streamer-chromecast-with-google-tv-1.jpg" alt="Chromecast with Google TV on top of Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KxGzsEQrWLgKbUfCsHJy7F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's something I don't understand — why is Google, or any company for that matter, using a processor that's more than three years old? That's exactly what we have in the TV Streamer, as it's powered by MediaTek's MT8696. This just so happens to be the same SoC found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review-obnoxious-ads-ruin-fun">Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K Max from 2021</a>. The same one that was replaced by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">faster model</a> about a year ago.</p><p>To be clear, the only hiccups in performance that I've seen have been with trying to mess around with RetroArch and different emulators. However, there's no way this is going to be able to still be this snappy a few years down the road. I really would've liked to see Google stop this "glass half-full" approach that we've seen in various devices over the years.</p><p>Part of the reason I don't really have much to say about the interface is that it's not all that great. Sure, it gives me some pretty solid recommendations while putting my installed apps near the top. But that's about where it starts to fall short for me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DvQ6VUVGATmkT7wGxYesUL" name="google-tv-streamer-review-google-freeplay-1.jpg" alt="Google Freeplay on the Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvQ6VUVGATmkT7wGxYesUL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite having the app set up and installed, the only options shown within the "Live" tab are for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-is-cranking-up-the-content-with-a-fresh-batch-of-free-channels">Google's Freeplay service</a>. That's great and all, but why can't I access the channels from the streaming service I want?</p><p>It's not like Google isn't aware of the other streaming services out there, so let me connect and use the pay that I pay for. Maybe the onus is on the streaming service, and not Google, but I have a feeling that's not the case considering there's no settings panel that lets you connect to other live TV services.</p><p>Another potential issue feels more like an oversight. You just picked up the TV Streamer, and you're excited to get it all set up and everything. You tear the box apart, go to plug everything in, and realize that you're missing something—the HDMI cable.</p><p>That's because Google doesn't include one in the box but <em>will</em> sell you an "Ultra High-Speed" cable for another $20. Of course, this doesn't help much now that you already have the TV Streamer without a cable to connect it to your TV.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7" name="google-tv-streamer-apps-page.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Apps page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is attempting to semi-rectify the situation by offering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/googles-dollar10-hdmi-cable-credit-for-the-tv-streamer-should-last-forever">$10 discount code</a> if you pre-ordered the TV Streamer. However, this only applies to pre-ordered units, and the "deal" will expire at the end of November. There's a good chance that you have an HDMI cable lying around, but the point is that it's something Google should have included in the box.</p><p>My last gripe has to do with game streaming apps, and how few of them are actually available. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-play-xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-on-chromebooks">Xbox Game Pass</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/ps-remote-play-ps5-streaming-chromecast-with-google-tv">PS Remote Play</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-luna-hands-on">Amazon Luna</a> are nowhere to be found. When trying to download them from the Play Store website on my PC, the Streamer is greyed out and says "This item is not compatible with your device."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7XK9PypwQTGubUVVUuNTgn" name="google-tv-streamer-review-xbplay.jpg" alt="XBPlay listing on Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XK9PypwQTGubUVVUuNTgn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have no earthly idea what's happening here, but this isn't it. Sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a> and Steam Link show up, which is great. But we should also be able to use the others, and I wish we knew why this isn't the case.</p><p>Maybe Google is playing "keep away" after Game Pass landed on the Fire TV earlier this year. Whatever the reason, it's time for these tactics to stop because, at the end of the day, you're only hurting the people who end up buying your products.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EVNMUf7pubBDDRNpVPAut" name="roku-ultra-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Roku Ultra 2024 lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EVNMUf7pubBDDRNpVPAut.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roku)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Apple TV 4K (3rd Gen) includes double the storage (64GB vs. 32GB), a more powerful processor (A15 Bionic), and an excellent streaming experience for about $30 more than the TV Streamer. However, the base model lacks an Ethernet port, nor does it double as a Thread border router. If those features matter to you, then you'll be looking at $149 for the Wi-Fi + Ethernet Apple TV.</p><p>More recently, Roku released its most powerful streaming device yet, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-ultra-2024-streamer-launch-os-14-detailed">Roku Ultra 2024</a>. The company claims it's "more than 30% faster than other Roku players," along with upgrading to Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1. There's smart home connectivity too, however, it appears that the integration is only available if you make use of Roku's growing lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a>.</p><p>Rounding out the pack is Amazon. Currently, you won't find a Fire TV device at the same price as the TV Streamer, as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max retails for $60, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2022-review">Cube</a> comes in at $140. It's a surprising "hole" in Amazon's lineup, so we wonder if Amazon might end up introducing something to go toe-to-toe with the TV Streamer in the future.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a high-end Google TV streaming box.</li><li>You're tired of the onslaught of ads presented by competing devices.</li><li>You want a streaming device that doubles as a smart home hub, and more.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the most powerful streaming device.</li><li>You want to use this as a game streaming box.</li><li>You need a cheap streaming device.</li><li>You want integration between third-party live TV streaming services and the Streamer.</li></ul>
<p>When it comes to whether I would recommend the TV Streamer, I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place. For me, it's a no-brainer, as the ads aren't as annoying, I'm comfortable with side-loading apps, and the Streamer features Matter and Thread support. These are some of the things that I care about, in addition to offering seamless integration into my Google-focused smart home.</p><p>On the other hand, it's not as powerful as I feel it should be at this price. It doesn't help that the Streamer uses a less performant SoC than the latest Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which costs $40 less. Do I think Google missed the mark with pricing? Not in the slightest, but I do think corners were cut for the sake of margins, and it's just disappointing.</p><p>That being said, I've really enjoyed using the TV Streamer, and I'm already planning on picking up another one so I can stop moving this one back and forth between my home office and living room. I only hope that with a bit more RAM and storage wiggle room, Google can continue to improve the experience.</p>

<ul><li>With the October feature drop, Google introduced underwater photography to the Pixel 9 series.</li><li>The feature-included update is now seeing a wider rollout through the Pixel Camera 9.6 app version via Play Store.</li><li>It also brings a vertical panorama capture feature and Pixel devices ranging from Pixel 6 to Pixel 8a have easier access to astronomy.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently announced an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October feature drop</a> next to the Android 15 update for compatible Pixel phones, including the latest Pixel 9 series. The latter gains some exciting camera features, such as underwater photo and video capabilities.</p><p>The Pixel Camera 9.6 update provides these new capabilities, which, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/18/pixel-camera-9-6/">9to5Google</a>, is believed to be rolling out to all supported Pixel phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-2.jpg" alt="Camera app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is widely happening through the Play Store for devices above <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>. However, not all the models are suitable for the new camera features. For example, the underwater photography features are aimed at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series only, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> isn&apos;t part of it.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the underwater photography and video features enable users to restore true colors when the photo or video is captured underwater. Google also recommends using a waterproof case when using the device for longer periods. Enabling the toggle should help users shoot better underwater, and it applies to devices including Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>Suppose you own the latest Pixel 9 series device. In that case, you might be on the Pixel Camera 9.5 update, and installing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October feature drop</a> next to the Pixel Camera 9.6 update should not only give you the underwater photography feature next to a vertical panorama capture, which is said to be supported "in the redesigned mode." Earlier, users could only shoot horizontal panorama images.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-03.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5057" height="2848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera update will benefit non-Pixel 9 series users by adding some nifty features, too, like the ability to quickly enter into Astrophotography mode from the camera&apos;s Night Sight tab, reducing a couple of steps in navigation.</p><p>9to5 further notes that the Pixel Camera 9.6 adds strings to "Quick access controls," like the ability to adjust white balance, brightness, and shadows just by tapping the viewfinder. However, it still needs to be enabled for users to use it effectively.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra color options are tipped; however, no pink color option is in the works.</li><li>The color options of the next Ultra include Black, Green, Blue, and Titanium.</li><li>Another recent leak also revealed the device's new flatter design.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has already been in the news for its next flagship phones, especially since renders of the Galaxy S25 series, including the Ultra model, surfaced online very recently. A new tip from a notable leaker now gives us even more details about the Galaxy S25 Ultra model.</p><p>Tipster Ice Universe has shared the possible color options for the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra, which might be available in Black, Green, Blue, and Titanium colorways. The predecessor, which turned out to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, also featured similar color variants, and it appears the successor isn&apos;t offering any variety like the recent Pixel 9 series, which came in Pink shades for models in the lot.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING！The Galaxy S25 Ultra will debut in four color options:Black, Green, Blue, TitaniumI I don't know the online color scheme yet. pic.twitter.com/KNHZTC6lma<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1847464483763212618">October 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from the latest color options, the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra has been spotted multiple times over the past few weeks. It includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">first possible renders</a>, which give away everything about the Ultra&apos;s design. While it carries similar design elements to the previous iteration, the sides are likely to be flatter per the renders, and the camera visor is similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>This time, the device is also expected to be lighter, alongside the minor design changes. Earlier leaks have also revealed the camera system, which could include a 200MP H2 primary lens coupled with a 50MP ISOCELL JN3 ultra-wide-angle sensor. Users can also expect a 10MP IMX745 lens acting as a telephoto camera and another 50MP IMX584 5x lens.</p>
<p>Aside from these specs, the Galaxy S25 Ultra has also been spotted in some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4-hits-benchmark">Geekbench tests</a>, which not only confirmed the powerful single- and multi-core scores but also confirmed the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset (set to launch later this month) and the incorporation of 12GB RAM.</p><p>While we await its launch, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is still a couple of months away. Samsung is having yet another interesting launch event in Korea on October 21, where the long-rumored special edition of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is expected to launch. It will likely be slimmer than the latter, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1847799787950858418">Ice Universe also notes</a> that the 200MP sensor on the upcoming foldable will give better results than that featured in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus 13 has an early launch date for the Chinese region this year.</li><li>The flagship phone is releasing on October 31 in China, which is couple of months earlier than its predecessor launch.</li><li>While the OnePlus 13's design is revealed already, it is expected to be powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, and a new BOE X2 screen.</li></ul>

<p>OnePlus is bringing its most loved flagship early this year, even earlier than the predecessor model. The company has teased the OnePlus 13 already, and now it has a launch date as early as the end of this month. </p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/cn/13-launch">OnePlus website listing</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> will launch on October 31 in China, much earlier than the predecessor&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> launch last December in the country. It was quickly followed by a global launch early this year.</p>

<p>The tendency to launch flagships early has been widely seen over the past couple of years, and this year, it appears more significant than before. Qualcomm usually launches its flagship Snapdragon chipset (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> this year) in the fourth quarter of every year. OEM makers like Xiaomi and OnePlus are usually the early adopters of the flagship processor as they launch their flagships by the end of the quarter, at least in China first.</p><p>However, OnePlus is going ahead with the flagship launch way early this time, making it one of the quickest Android flagship phone launches. The bridge between the two flagship models is hardly ten months. This tendency is familiar to the company because it used to launch a slightly upgraded flagship phone under the popular T-series.</p>

<p>As for the launch teaser, the OnePlus 13 is already revealed by the company — and thanks to previous render leaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-oneplus-13-image-rear-camera-changes-rumor">real-life images</a>, we already know what the company&apos;s upcoming flagship looks like. </p><p>Unlike its predecessor, the OnePlus 13 will have slightly flatter sides and rounded corners. The frame appears to be made of Titanium, similar to its counterparts. As per the teased images, the device will likely be seen in black, blue, and white finishes. </p><p>The camera visor, however, looks no different than the previous iteration. Still, the Hasselblad branding is moved and engraved to the device&apos;s back instead of being incorporated in the camera visor. By its looks, we might see an all-new OnePlus flagship, as the flatter frame appears to be playing a significant role in terms of design. </p>

<p>As for the expected specs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">previous leaks</a> and benchmark tests have indicated that it will have a 6.8-inch flat screen produced by BOE, which is dubbed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">X2 screen</a>. It will be powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, and the device is tipped to incorporate up to 24GB of RAM. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">leaked benchmarks</a> have also confirmed interesting performance scores, and with the early launch, OnePlus could be setting the benchmark first for other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> to compete in the following months.</p>

<ul><li>In the high-profile Epic v. Google lawsuit, U.S. Judge James Donato issued an injunction that would make sweeping changes to the way Google operates.</li><li>Many of these changes were set to take effect Nov. 1, but recently, Judge Donato issued a temporary administrative stay on all but one of them. </li><li>The decision of whether to hold off on forcing these changes while Google appeals now rests with the Ninth Circuit court, which is expected to extend the administrative stay.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Late last year, the jury in the Epic v. Google case returned a verdict that the Google Play Store had become an illegal monopoly. More recently, U.S. Judge James Donato issued an injunction outlining the changes Google would be forced to make to the Play Store as part of that verdict. Google is appealing that verdict, and while it does — a process that could lengthen — the company may not have to make most of the changes required by Judge Donato&apos;s injunction. </p><p>Google and Epic both confirmed that Judge Donato issued a temporary administrative stay on Friday, Oct. 18 for all the measures in his injunction save for one (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24271996/google-epic-lawsuit-play-third-party-app-store-changes-delayed-administrative-stay-granted" target="_blank">The Verge</a>). Initially, the steps had to be in place by Nov. 1, a deadline that was quickly approaching. Google received just 30 days to comply with Judge Donato&apos;s injunction before he issued the administrative stay.</p><p>Shortly after the details of Epic v. Google verdict and the injunction were announced, Google vowed to appeal. In an Oct. 7, 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" target="_blank">statement</a>, the company said that the injunction&apos;s measures "will cause a range of unintended consequences that will harm American consumers, developers and device makers."</p><p>"These Epic-requested changes stem from a decision that is completely contrary to another court’s rejection of similar claims Epic made against Apple — even though, unlike iOS, Android is an open platform that has always allowed for choice and flexibility like multiple app stores and sideloading," the company continued. "We are appealing that underlying decision and we will ask the courts to pause Epic’s requested changes, pending that appeal."</p><p>Additionally, Google updated that statement on Oct. 16, when it asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to pause the changes that would be required by the injunction starting Nov. 1. It also asked Judge Donato to issue the administrative stay, which he did, but only long enough for the Ninth Circuit court to make a decision. </p><p>The company also shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/FACT_SHEET__WHATS_AT_STAKE_AS_WE_APPEAL_THE_EPIC_V._GOOGLE_DECISION_-_Google_Docs.pdf" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> describing "what&apos;s at stake" and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/2024-10-16_Emergency_Motion_for_Stay_Pending_Appeal.pdf" target="_blank">full emergency motion</a> to the Ninth Circuit court. In essence, Google is unsatisfied by the decision and believes the short turnaround time for requiring the injunction&apos;s changes would put users at risk. </p><p>" At the request of a single competitor, Epic Games, the District Court ordered extensive redesigns to Play that will expose 100-million-plus U.S. users of Android devices to substantial new security risks and force fundamental changes to Google’s contractual and business relationships with hundreds of thousands of Google partners," the company said in the emergency filing.</p><p>"The court gave Google just three weeks to make many of these sweeping change — a Herculean task creating an unacceptable risk of safety and security failures within the Android ecosystem."</p><p>The Ninth Circuit court still needs to rule on whether the measures of the injunction will be delayed until it rules on Google&apos;s appeal. If it grants Google&apos;s emergency motion — which Judge Donato reportedly told people in the courtroom he expects the Ninth Circuit to, per The Verge — users might not see major changes to the Google Play Store for years.</p><p>For mow, the only measure of the injunction still set to take effect Nov. 1 is the order that bars Google make deals with OEMs or carriers that block the preinstallation of competing app stores. In theory, this could make it possible for third-party app stores — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">Epic Game Store</a> — to ship pre-installed on devices sold by certain carriers or brands.  </p>

The Galaxy Ring is now on sale in the country, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/in/rings/galaxy-ring/galaxy-ring-titanium-black-size-10-sm-q500nzkainu/">costs ₹38,999 ($465)</a>, $65 more than what it retails for in the U.S. To put things into context, the Galaxy Ring costs ₹2,000 ($25) more than the LTE-enabled variant of the 45mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, which can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/in/watches/galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch7-44mm-green-lte-sm-l315fzgains/buy/">bought for ₹36,999 ($442)</a> right now.</p>

<p>I don't really understand who Samsung is targeting with its smart ring, and while the Galaxy Ring marks the brand's introduction into a new segment, I don't think the brand is likely to find many takers in India. The Galaxy Ring costs too much in the country, and there's also the small matter of it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">not being a good product</a>. Samsung says the cost of its products are determined by marketing after due research, but the fact remains that the Galaxy Ring has a hefty premium over its rivals.</p><p>Indian customers tend to be tech-savvy in general — a by-product of the population skewing younger — and while Samsung has a massive userbase in the country, there's just not enough on offer with the Galaxy Ring to entice many buyers. The smart ring is able to track daily activity and sleep, but the accuracy of the data is in line with a budget fitness band, and doesn't measure up to regular smartwatches — the Galaxy Watch 7 does a much better job at just about every metric.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key differentiator of the Galaxy Ring is that it's an "invisible" wearable; it's not as cumbersome to wear as a smartwatch while still delivering useful health and activity metrics. If Samsung came out with the Galaxy Ring two years ago, then it would have been a different situation, because as it stands, there are better products that offer the same features and don't cost anywhere as much.</p><p>I'm partial to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>. I wore the smart ring through most of 2024, and while fitness monitoring is inconsistent, it consistently delivered usable insights. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/in/">coming in at ₹25,469 ($305)</a> as of writing, it significantly undercuts the Galaxy Ring. Noise is a dominant brand in India's budget wearable segment, and it has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/noise-luna-ring-review">Luna Ring</a>; it isn't particularly great, but if all you need is a smart ring that shows activity data, it is a decent choice — and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.lunazone.com/products/luna-smart-ring">just ₹21,999 ($263)</a>.</p><p>Both products have their shortcomings, and if you want a smart ring with accurate activity monitoring, Amazfit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Helio Ring</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://in.amazfit.com/products/amazfit-helio-ring">available in India for ₹24,999</a> ($300). My colleagues did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-ring-hr-accuracy-test">extensive testing of smart rings</a>, and the Helio Ring's heart rate measurements proved to be the most consistent of the lot.</p><p>Samsung touts the seamless integration with other Galaxy devices, but right now, you don't get much in the way of features. And while the brand positions AI as a differentiator, it doesn't do enough with the basics to make it stand out.</p><p>It's telling, then, that the Galaxy Ring is sold out in sizes eight through 13 just a few days after availability — Samsung likely brought a very limited inventory of smart rings to the country. It's clear that smart rings are set to become a new revenue driver for the brand, and I'm crossing my fingers that a second-gen model of the Galaxy Band does more to justify the asking price.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s no shortage of choice if you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">home NAS</a>, and you don&apos;t have to rely on conventional HDDs either — all-flash NAS servers are gaining momentum, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">F8 SSD Plus</a> is a terrific showcase in this area. But what if you need a portable option, one that&apos;s tailored to work on the go?</p><p>You can get an SSD enclosure, slot in a drive, and connect that to your phone, and while that is a decent alternative, you don&apos;t get much in the way of features. That&apos;s where UnifyDrive&apos;s UT2 comes in; the NAS is designed to be a truly portable solution, and it comes with the ability to back up photos and videos from your phone, easily make that data accessible on your home network, and even back up SD cards.</p><p>While UnifyDrive is a new entrant in this category, the UT2 gets a lot right from the get-go, and having used the NAS for just over a month, I think it is a great choice if you need a reliable way to back up data while traveling.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-pricing-and-availability"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZCUAen8iugHAdNYHvDxjJQ" name="unifydrive-ut2-11.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 back view with M.2 slots covered" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZCUAen8iugHAdNYHvDxjJQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UnifyDrive is crowdsourcing the UT2, with the NAS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1945743381/ut2-redefining-portable-storage-solutions">available on Kickstarter</a>. The UT2 is slated to retail for $599 when it starts general availability, but during the crowdfunding phase, you can pick it up for $399 — a $200 discount. The project has received $695,062 in funding as of writing, and UnifyDrive notes deliveries will start going out from November 2024.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-design"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4MzKB7tPs8h8uGCABnPpmN" name="unifydrive-ut2-7.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 profile view highlighting the design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4MzKB7tPs8h8uGCABnPpmN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UnifyDrive did a good job with the design of the UT2, and the NAS has a design that&apos;s similar to an external HDD — albeit bigger. There&apos;s a silicone case that gives much-needed protection to the chassis, and the diminutive design means the UT2 doesn&apos;t weigh much, coming in at just 350g.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Xhrh82ExS4JDpPf3Kc6xGN" name="unifydrive-ut2-9.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 side view showing vents" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xhrh82ExS4JDpPf3Kc6xGN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a vent on the side to deliver passive airflow to the innards, and the UT2 can hold two M.2 2280 SSDs. The drive slots are located on the underside, and the drive cover has a slotted design to prevent overheating. The design is refreshingly utilitarian, and the size along with lightweight nature of the UT2 makes it highly convenient to take anywhere. It is roughly the same dimensions as a 20000mAh power bank, but doesn&apos;t weigh as much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JDowSSaNg7XojYmbZfhgnQ" name="unifydrive-ut2-13.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JDowSSaNg7XojYmbZfhgnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering the size, you get an exhaustive selection of ports. The UT2 comes with a dedicated USB-C port to power the device and charge the internal battery, and there&apos;s a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port along with HDMI 2.1 connectivity. The HDMI port is a great addition, as it allows you to connect the NAS to a TV — UnifyDrive even bundles a remote with the UT2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7gksUvRwaCKXStCNJHbpmP" name="unifydrive-ut2-12.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 showing connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gksUvRwaCKXStCNJHbpmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other side, you get a USB-C port, CFexpress slot, standard SD card slot, and a USB-A port. The connectivity gives the UT2 a sizeable advantage over traditional external drives, and the fact that you can add up to 16TB of total storage — 8TB in each M.2 slot — makes it highly enticing. I didn&apos;t see any usability issues with the UT2; the NAS doesn&apos;t overheat even under load, and the silicon cover does a great job protecting the chassis.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-features"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KM4GU5CrgjBKHEuPmKrcmL" name="unifydrive-ut2-2.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 NAS next to Pixel 9 Pro XL showing device stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KM4GU5CrgjBKHEuPmKrcmL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UT2 has a decent set of features, and what I like the most about the device is the ability to easily back up SD cards with a single button. Just slot in an SD card, hit the PlugBackup button twice, and it will start backing up the contents of that card. It is a nifty use case, and one I utilized extensively in the month I tested the UT2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hTudYenb8RvKwDg7VUJJnM" name="unifydrive-ut2-4.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 NAS next to Pixel 9 Pro XL with device M.2 details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTudYenb8RvKwDg7VUJJnM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can set up the UT2 with the UnifyDrive app on Android, and it has a clean design and comes with a ton of useful features. Considering UnifyDrive is a new entrant, I figured it would have a basic mobile utility, but that isn&apos;t the case at all. You can easily access the data on the NAS, back up photos and videos on your phone to the NAS, monitor system and memory use, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uBbc6ad2ob5sKaVbV3n2KM" name="unifydrive-ut2-3.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 NAS next to Pixel 9 Pro XL showing available utilities" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBbc6ad2ob5sKaVbV3n2KM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The exhaustive control is a definite edge, and UnifyDrive deserves credit for getting this right on the initial try. Similar to every other NAS server, you can access the data via SMB — this is how I moved data to and from the NAS with my Windows machine — and there&apos;s a flash drive mode that effectively turns the UT2 into an external drive.</p>
<p>In flash drive mode, data is partitioned into exFAT so it can be readable as a drive on Windows and macOS machines, and what&apos;s great about this mode is that you can set the amount of storage you want to be accessible. Again, this is a feature that&apos;s thought out well, and you get all the other usual connectivity options to access data on your home network, including DLNA, WebDAV, NFS, and so on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GBJ2S6LFBFpTynuohzA6eS" name="unifydrive-ut2-5.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 built-in battery settings on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBJ2S6LFBFpTynuohzA6eS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UT2 comes with a built-in battery that safeguards data; it automatically kicks in when you remove the power connector, and you can set shutdown limits. The battery lasts under 90 minutes, and that&apos;s more than enough if you need to transfer photos during a shoot.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-performance"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Performance</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="edErs324yYRusgXiextpPR" name="unifydrive-ut2-15.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 M.2 drives with cover and toolset next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edErs324yYRusgXiextpPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UnifyDrive didn&apos;t leave anything out when it comes to the hardware, and the UT2 is powered by a Rockchip platform that has four Cortex A76 cores combined with a quartet of A55 cores clocked up to 2.4GHz. There&apos;s a Mali-G610 that has six shader cores, and 32GB eMMC flash memory. You get 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM, but it is soldered, and there&apos;s no way to increase memory down the line.</p><p>The dual M.2 2280 slots are based on the Gen 3 standard, and UnifyDrive bundled two 500 WD SSDs with the package for testing — the retail bundle doesn&apos;t include any storage. I didn&apos;t run into any issues when transferring data to the built-in SSD, and I got bandwidth similar to that of other all-flash NAS devices I tested.</p>

<p>The 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port is a welcome addition, and it allows you to slot in the NAS in a home setting with ease. There&apos;s also Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, and you get the option to set up the UT2 as a hotspot. It holds up well as an external drive when using the flash drive mode, and as I mentioned before, the ability to back up SD cards with the press of a single button is just convenient.</p><p>There are several features missing; UnifyDrive is adding a feature that lets you back up the contents of the NAS to a cloud server, and a built-in music player and e-reader aren&apos;t available as of writing.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eqXWNTysQbC7cyBpB2THdS" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-3.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus side view with logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqXWNTysQbC7cyBpB2THdS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UnifyDrive has a unique product in the UT2, and there isn&apos;t another NAS that does quite as much and is designed to be portable. If you need a good all-flash server to use in your home, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">TerraMaster&apos;s F8 SSD Plus</a>. It has eight M.2 slots, 10GbE connectivity, and better software features. But you don&apos;t get any portability with the NAS.</p><p>If you need a way to back up data on the go, an external SSD is still the best way, and I recommend Crucial&apos;s X10 Pro. I used this drive for the better part of a year now, and it has been reliable.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UXoiQFBVqVnMnmwxHWJRcT" name="unifydrive-ut2-14.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 connectivity and power ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UXoiQFBVqVnMnmwxHWJRcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a portable NAS to back up your phone data</li><li>You need a reliable way to back up SD cards</li><li>You want a NAS that doubles as an external drive</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a robust feature-set</li></ul>
<p>The idea of a portable NAS is highly alluring, and to its credit, UnifyDrive delivered the basics. The UT2 makes it easy to back up data, and the inherently portable design gives it a definite edge. You get all the connectivity options you could ask for, and the hardware itself is powerful — rivaling that of home-based NAS devices.</p><p>The biggest differentiator is its ability to back up SD and CFexpress with a single button, and the built-in battery allows it to be used on the go without any hassle. It holds up just as well as a home NAS thanks to 2.5GbE connectivity, and if you need an all-flash server that you can use on the road to back up photos and videos, the UT2 is a great overall choice.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has officially announced the "Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition."</li><li>It features a 6.5-inch cover screen, along with an 8-inch inner display, while being both thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</li><li>Pre-orders are set to kick off in South Korea on October 25, with a starting price of 2,789,600 won (~$2,035).</li><li>It's currently unknown whether the Z Fold Special Edition will come to more markets.</li></ul>
<p>Just a few days ago, Samsung finally acknowledged that it was set to release a new foldable phone. And now, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition has been officially announced.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-%ea%b0%a4%eb%9f%ad%ec%8b%9c-z-%ed%8f%b4%eb%93%9c-%ec%8a%a4%ed%8e%98%ec%85%9c-%ec%97%90%eb%94%94%ec%85%98-%ea%b5%ad%eb%82%b4-%ec%b6%9c%ec%8b%9c-2">press release (translated)</a>, Samsung wastes no time in pointing out the improvements between this model and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The Z Fold Special Edition is both thinner and lighter than its predecessor, as it&apos;s "1.5mm thinner and 3g lighter." However, those aren&apos;t the only two improvements that Samsung has made. </p><p>The cover screen and main display are both larger, coming in at 6.5-inches and 8-inches, respectively. As a result, both screens are also now a bit wider, which is something many hoped Samsung would implement with the Z Fold 6. Especially considering how other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> have adopted the wider cover screen, making it less cumbersome to do anything besides scroll social media or quickly reply to messages. </p>

<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-gets-a-launch-date">Z Fold Special Edition</a> is powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, it features 16GB of RAM, as opposed to 12GB. This comes as little surprise given the influx of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that we&apos;ve seen introduced in the past year, as it should offer a bit more performance and reliability when using those features.</p><p>Samsung has yet to share the entire list of specs for the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition but has one more trick up its sleeve. The outdated 50MP sensor from the Z Fold 6 has been replaced by a 200MP wide-angle lens, "supporting more vivid and clear photos and videos."  </p><p>Seeing as this is a "Special Edition," Samsung is opting to go with only one color option — Black Shadow. The company says that the combination of "the striped pattern and metal/glass materials provide a modern and sophisticated design."</p>

<p>There are a few things that Samsung didn&apos;t mention about its latest device, such as whether it will still support an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen</a>, along with any potential battery improvements. We&apos;ll likely have to wait until the phone becomes available for purchase before learning everything about this model. </p><p>In terms of price and availability, the Z Fold Special Edition is priced at 2,789,600 won (~$2,035), and pre-orders are set to kick off on October 25. There is a catch, however, as it appears that Samsung is only selling this phone in the company&apos;s home country of South Korea. </p><p>There&apos;s no mention or indication as to whether it will see a global launch or even arrive in other markets. </p>

They're fantastic, seamless options for passive health data, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">surprisingly decent at step counts</a> if you ignore the false positives from gestures. But for fitness tracking, pretty much every brand we've tested has given less-than-accurate results, to put it mildly.</p><p>So when Oura sold its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> as a better fitness option, with its Automatic Activity Detection and improved real-time HR data during workouts, I bullied our Oura reviewer into going for a run and working out to test this claim for himself.</p><p>Our managing editor Derrek Lee is building a real collection of smart rings now, with the Oura Ring 4, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2</a>. I asked him to work out while wearing each, compared against smartwatches that we've tested with reliable optical heart rate accuracy, and see how close the smart rings came to a proper result.</p><p>I also slipped on my Ultrahuman Ring Air to see how it performed, while including the fitness test we performed during our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring review</a>. Here's what we learned!</p>

<h2 id="why-testing-smart-ring-accuracy-is-so-hard-2">Why testing smart ring accuracy is so hard</h2>
<p>Before I show the results, I'll point out that this test won't be as detailed and graph-happy as my previous fitness tests, like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">cheap fitness watch accuracy test</a> or my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">Garmin v. Coros v. Polar flagship</a> showdown.</p><p>Why? Most smart ring apps (besides Amazfit's Zepp Health) don't have the tools to export heart rate graphs for specific workouts, like you can with established fitness watch brands. We tried to export Oura's GPX files from Derrek's Strava account and it made my usual HR graph tool <em>crash</em> every time I tried to upload it.</p><p>Plus, some of these smart rings don't even let you trigger a manual workout unless it's a specific type, like walking or running. For some brands like RingConn, we had to trick the app by saying Derrek was "running" during a gym workout to have it save his heart rate data. Without a workout mode, smart rings don't sample your heart rate frequently enough for the results to be at all helpful.</p><p>Point being, I'm mostly making these comparisons based on heart rate averages and eyeballing HR graphs from slapdash manual workouts. But don't worry: It's still enough data to show how middling most of these smart rings are for fitness.</p>
<h2 id="testing-smart-ring-heart-rate-accuracy-during-workouts-2">Testing smart ring heart rate accuracy during workouts</h2>
<p>For this smart ring fitness accuracy test, Derrek ran once and completed four gym workouts, wearing two watches — the Garmin Venu 3 and Pixel Watch 3 — and three smart rings from Amazfit, Oura, and RingConn. These were the results:</p>

<p>Without a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">proper chest or arm strap</a>, I can't say for certain whether the Venu 3 or Pixel Watch 3 was more accurate for Derrek; the Venu 3 did very well in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">my review</a> compared to a COROS band, while I gave the Pixel Watch 3 a "B" for accuracy in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">its review</a>, generally extremely accurate but struggling in the 160+ bpm range. Still, you can see that both match each other fairly closely, as a benchmark for what wrist-based optical sensors typically offer for accuracy.</p><p>Now compare these three smart rings' massive gap in results. You'll see that only the Amazfit Helio Ring is consistently accurate — especially if we flip a coin and assume Google is more accurate than Garmin here. Its averages are very much on point, and while its max-HR data falls short, it's not <em>as</em> underestimated as Oura or RingConn.</p><p>It's not perfect, of course. You can see in the two heart rate graphs below that it falls well short of Garmin for an extended stretch once Derrek's heart rate reaches certain heights; in the second graph, it's always close but tends to show small valleys where Garmin peaks. But overall, it's closer than I expected from any smart ring.</p>

<p>Oura doesn't do badly for low-aerobic workouts in the 100–130 range, but the higher Derrek's heart rate climbed, the more difficulties the Oura Ring 4 had. In the last workout, the heart rate chart showed a massive 60–70 bpm gap for most of the workout.</p>

<p>RingConn's stats are so far off that Derrek speculated that the issue might be that he was forced to wear it on his ring finger instead of his usual index finger (he only has so many fingers, after all), leaving it too loose for a proper reading. That might explain the issue, so we can give RingConn a tentative pass here, while still keeping the data for now.</p>

<p>I will point out that if you wear a smartwatch too loosely or too tightly, your results will be skewed, too...but not <em>this</em> much. It goes to show how important a smart ring's fit is for proper results.</p>
<p>Nick and I own the Galaxy Ring and Ultrahuman Ring Air, respectively, with no other smart rings. So our tests are more straightforward, showing how they compare against our smartwatches of choice.</p>

<p>Nick already wrote about the Galaxy Ring's fitness struggles in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">review</a>: The Pixel Watch 2 and OnePlus Watch 2 averaged 170 and 169 bpm during a hard Spartan Race; the Galaxy Ring averaged under 150 bpm, randomly splitting the race across two activities.</p><p>As for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, it still lists its Workout Mode as in Beta about half a year after I finished my review, and the results are still wonky. Unlike other smart rings that severely underestimate your active heart rate, Ultrahuman told me my heart rate average was 182 bpm for a track workout when Garmin said it was 168 bpm. A couple of days later, it told me my average during a light run was 153 bpm; Garmin registered 143 bpm and said 153 bpm was my <em>max</em>.</p>
<h2 id="does-smart-ring-fitness-accuracy-matter-2">Does smart ring fitness accuracy matter?</h2>
<p>As I said from the beginning, most athletes won't buy a smart ring specifically for workouts. Runners and cyclists want a watch for its GPS and screen data, and while you can lift weights while wearing a smart ring, it can distract from your grip and get scratched up unless you attach a silicone cover.</p><p>Still, even if people don't expect a smart ring to be perfect, they want <em>ballpark</em> accuracy so they can keep track of burned calories. And since brands like Oura and Ultrahuman try to estimate your VO2 Max or Cardio Capacity, it's important that they do so with accurate data instead of inadvertently misleading people.</p><p>I came into this test assuming that the new Oura Ring would sweep away the competition, but you know what they say about assuming! Instead, it's the Amazfit Helio Ring that won the hardware accuracy contest. And since Amazfit recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-gets-permanent-price-drop-and-free-subscriptions">discounted it to $199</a> and made its pricey subscriptions free, the Helio Ring has become more appealing.</p><p>On the other hand, the Helio Ring has unresolved problems like the limited number of sizes (three), short battery life (four days), and lack of automatic workout detection. You might still prefer an Oura Ring with its middling accuracy because you don't have to manually start a workout in the app every time you run or lift weights.</p><p>In other words, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> have work to do on the fitness front, but maybe they're close enough for everyday athletes not to mind the accuracy gaps. Either that or they'll just keep using their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> instead and only use smart rings for health and sleep data.</p>

<p>Google recently made Chrome for Android even better on the accessibility front. Now, you can listen to web pages while doing other things, thanks to a nifty upgrade for the "Listen to this page" feature.</p><p>This update, which was first announced last month as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-september-2024-feature-drop">September Android Feature Drop</a>, makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">fan-favorite browser</a> more user-friendly and accessible. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/18/chrome-listen-page-background-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Chrome 130 is now bringing background playback support for the "Listen to this page" feature to Android users.</p><p>The background playback feature first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/chrome-on-android-to-support-background-playback-for-read-aloud/" target="_blank">popped up</a> in June after a low-key rollout, and it was kept under wraps as an experimental flag. Before this update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome for Android</a> would only read web pages aloud when the app was open. You could switch tabs, but if you left the browser or locked your screen, the audio would stop if Chrome wasn’t in the foreground.</p><p>The latest update finally tackles this issue. Now, the browser will keep playing audio even if you turn off your screen or switch to another app. When you do switch, the article will show up as a media player in your notification panel, complete with easy play/pause and 10-second skip/rewind buttons.</p><p>On top of that, the media player in your notifications will highlight the article's headline and website. If you want to tweak the playback speed or change the voice, you’ll have to hop into the playback widget within Chrome itself.</p>

<p>As always, you can adjust the audio speed to fit your vibe. There’s a bunch of voice options to pick from, too.  Plus, you can set Chrome to highlight the text as it reads and scroll through the content, so it’s easy to keep up.</p><p>Just like the name implies, Listen to this page uses text-to-speech to read articles and web pages out loud in Chrome. When you turn it on, a handy mini-player shows up at the bottom of the screen for easy access.</p><p>You can quickly access the feature from Chrome's three-dot menu. If you use it a lot, you can add a handy shortcut right by the address bar. Just head to the Toolbar shortcut settings in Chrome and choose "Listen to this page."</p>
