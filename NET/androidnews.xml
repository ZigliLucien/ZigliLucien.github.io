<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, Motorola launched its foldables, the Razr 2024 and Razr Plus 2024, featuring massive screens with the touch of AI. </p><p>As anticipated and according to the most recent leaks, the Razr Plus 2024 comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> chipset, 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 50MP main camera, and a 50MP telephoto shooter with 2x optical zoom. The biggest win, however, is its 4-inch pOLED display cover screen, which Motorola says is the biggest cover screen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> yet.</p><p>The inner pOLED screen unfolds to a 6.9-inch 1080p panel with a 165Hz refresh rate and 3000 nits peak brightness. Users can find all apps compatible with the device&apos;s cover screen, including Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a>. The Razr Plus 2024 comes in four colorways: Midnight Blue, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, and Hot Pink.</p><p>There&apos;s also the standard Razr 2024, which is roughly the same size as the premium model but with a smaller cover screen. Its outer display is a 3.6-inch 90Hz OLED. At first glance, it looks like a refreshed version of last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>, but with some spec changes, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a> chipset, a larger 4,200mAh battery, and a 50MP main camera with OIS. The inner screen is similar at 6.9 inches but with a lower 120Hz refresh rate. The Razr comes in Beach Sand, Koala Grey, and Spritz Orange in vegan leather colorways.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-2024-series-flips-the-script-with-a-massive-cover-screen-and-ai-smarts">available for preorder</a> on July 10 and will go on sale on July 24, retailing for $999 and $699, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Several folks from Android Central and other tech enthusiasts within the industry were in for a surprise this week. Google sent out personalized invites to its upcoming "Made by Google" event, which is set to take place way ahead of fall this time.</p><p>The event will happen on August 13 (Tuesday) at Google headquarters in Mountain View, with the Keynote starting at 10 a.m. PT, followed by a hands-on product experience.</p><p>While we have a fair idea of what to expect at this event, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL, we anticipate that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, a new generation of Pixel Buds, Pixel Fold, and a new Pixel Tablet will also make their debut this August.

While it may seem strange that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-the-odd-timing-of-the-google-pixel-event-could-mean">Google opted to launch its flagship </a>products earlier this year,  we feel that Google could be trying to streamline its product announcements and beat competitors with the early event.</p><p>Registrations for the event will begin July 31.<br></p>

The company is set to host its next Galaxy Unpacked event on July 10 in Paris, France. The company states it is preparing to reveal its rollout of "cutting-edge innovations."</p><p>We expect an event loaded with new devices this summer as Samsung prepares to debut the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>. The company showed off the device during MWC 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">and confirmed</a> some key specifications. Dr Hon Pak, head of the Samsung digital health team, informed the press that the Galaxy Ring&apos;s battery is estimated to last between "five and nine days."</p><p>Other than the ring, the company&apos;s next foldables might also be launching, several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/overseas-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-listing-color-leak">recent leaks showed</a> renders of the the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6. We would likely see several other wearables, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 and 7 Ultra</a> also make an appearance at the event. </p><p>EVP and Head of R&D Mobile Experience, Won-Joon Choi, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-ai-experience-optimized-upcoming-foldable-teased">teased in June</a> that an "optimized" Galaxy AI experience would arrive on its clamshell and book-style devices.

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-leak"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>On Tuesday (June 25), Canada&apos;s Amazon listing ended up showcasing the rumored and upcoming Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and its specs. </p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://passionategeekz.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-revealed-features-and-pricing-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank">PassionateGeekz</a>, the listing showcases the regular Galaxy Watch 7 Bluetooth variant featuring 40mm size and a price tag of CAD 358 (~$268). It further confirms that the smartwatch will feature a round-shaped display and sport at least 128GB of storage. It will be powered by a 3nm SoC that promises to boost power efficiency and carry out smoother all-round operations.</p><p>The leak alleges that the watch will have a BioActiveSensor that tracks health features like heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen levels — during workouts, sleep with sleep quality analysis, and more. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> will likely sport Galaxy AI, and as the description points out, "Personalized Daily AI Companion for AI-Powered Sleep, Exercises, and communication." This isn&apos;t too surprising, given the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI 6 Watch beta</a> brings said features to the Galaxy Watch 6 and other compatible watches. Another thing to note about this listing is that the Galaxy Watch 7 could come in a Cream colorway, along with multiple color options. </p><p>The Amazon listing also shows that the watch could be delivered to users as early as July 16.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>There&apos;s a debate around students using AI: "Is it safe to give them access and help them learn, or is AI basically making them lazy?" This week, Google wanted to add another leaf to that existing debate.</p><p>The company announced that it&apos;s preparing to bring Gemini to teen students using school accounts in "over 100 countries." According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/ai-workspace-chromebook-iste-2024/" target="_blank">Keyword post</a>, the company detailed that "in the coming months," teens at the minimum age requirement (13) can chat with Gemini through their school account. </p><p>Google states that Gemini&apos;s capabilities will be disabled by default, but school admins can enable it through the "Admin console." A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/workspace-gemini-classroom-iste-2024/" target="_blank">subsequent post</a> states that students using Gemini through a school account will have checks in place to block inappropriate content. </p><p>Gemini will filter out "illegal or age-gated substances" from appearing in its results. Additionally, the AI will run a fact-check on a response when asked for the first time. Looks like Google is trying to meet educators and students in the middle by allowing "teen students to learn responsibly and confidently in an AI-first future." It remains to be seen how these schools will incorporate the power of artificial intelligence into their curriculum.</p>

That means Samsung has a lot of old inventory to clear out, and fast. And with Amazon Prime Day coming up just a week after Unpacked, you may want to wait on the new Galaxy Watch 7 or Watch Ultra in favor of a cheaper Galaxy Watch 6 or FE.</p><p>Last year&apos;s Prime event took place before Unpacked, but Samsung still took a fire-sale approach. You could get a Galaxy Watch 5 for $151 or $128 off, which was the lowest price we&apos;d ever seen on it. Its LTE variants were $100 off as well. And you could snag a Z Fold 4 for an absurd $700 off.</p><p>Right now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6?th=1" target="_blank"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6 is $239 ($60 off)</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Streaming/dp/B0C63CFZ68" target="_blank"><strong>Galaxy Z Fold 5 is $400 off</strong></a>, which are pretty good deals in their own right. But if you&apos;re patient, I predict these prices will fall to new lows once Prime Day starts on July 16—just six days after Unpacked.</p><p>Of course, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w" target="_blank"><strong>reserve a Galaxy Watch 7 pre-order for $50 off</strong></a> from Samsung, if you want the most cutting-edge tech and features.

<p>All the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 rumors</a> say it could have 32GB of storage and a slightly faster CPU, but it should be pretty similar to the Watch 6 in style and sensors, and any new Wear OS upgrades like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-ai-health-and-fitness-insights">Galaxy AI health stats</a> will come to the Watch 6 just a couple of weeks after the Watch 7 launch.</p><p>I wrote last year that Samsung needed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-s9-offers-4x-storage-galaxy-watch-6">give Galaxy Watches more storage</a>, and some people will need the doubled space for music playlists or extra apps. But otherwise, if you can save $100 or more on a Watch 6 with another three years of promised upgrades, you may want to "downgrade" to our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">favorite Android watch</a> of the past 12 months.</p><p>Also, remember that Samsung ran out of Galaxy Watch 5 stock pretty quickly after Prime Day last year. So, if you want a cheaper last-gen option, July or August would be the time to buy one.</p><p>Now, if you want the leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra</a>, with all the top-end specs and multi-day battery life that entails, then disregard the deal-hunting and preorder that instead. But I assume it&apos;ll cost more than many of you will willingly pay if its price is anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>&apos;s.</p><p>We&apos;ve heard conflicting rumors about whether Samsung will sell a new Watch 7 Pro or Classic, in addition to the Ultra. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Watch 5 Pro</a> has stuck around for two years, but I&apos;d expect an everything-must-go sale on them if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-chip-performance-rumors">Watch 7 Pro</a> really exists.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:908px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="N627yqjsmPa4gr54wEYxLi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-FE-press-photo-running.jpeg" alt="A photo of a woman running while wearing the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N627yqjsmPa4gr54wEYxLi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="908" height="511" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your other money-saving option is the new Galaxy Watch FE, which is essentially a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-4">Galaxy Watch 4 re-release</a> with added Sapphire Crystal and a fresh set of software updates. It starts at $199, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-deal-drops-the-new-galaxy-watch-fe-to-only-dollar99-with-any-smartwatch-trade-in-guaranteed">cut the price to $99 with a smartwatch trade-in</a>. So, if you have an old pre-Wear OS Galaxy Watch lying around in a closet, you can get a solid smartwatch for less than an Amazfit.</p><p>Now, we can always hope that Samsung will wow us with the Galaxy Watch 7 announcement at Galaxy Unpacked. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-buds-3-series-render-leak">leaked renders</a> make it <em>look</em> pretty darn similar to the Watch 6, aside from some colorful stitching on the default silicone band. We&apos;ll have to hope for more intangible upgrades, like better battery life or revamped health sensors.</p><p>We&apos;ll find out more on July 10! But since it&apos;ll ship a few weeks after Unpacked, that gives you time to check out Prime Day 2024 first and see if Samsung makes the Galaxy Watch 6 cheap enough to tempt you. That way, you can put that extra cash towards a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> or foldable phone instead.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to feature rounded corners, making it more comfortable to hold compared to its sharper predecessors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> rocks a minimalist look with its flat screen and sharp edges. It’s definitely a head-turner and one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android picks</a>, but this design leans more towards style than comfort. Those sharp corners can start to press into your palms during extended use, making it a bit less hand-friendly.</p><p>Supporting design shift rumors, industry insider Ice Universe reported discomfort from the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s sharp corners. This aligns with claims that the phone&apos;s boxy design isn&apos;t ergonomic for long-term use. Ice Universe suggests the next model might feature "really rounded" corners like the Galaxy Note 7.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S25 Ultra is as round as Galaxy Note7, and I like this change. pic.twitter.com/KLrd2Y3BFg<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1806530264421871906">June 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Don&apos;t expect a total redesign, though: the S25 Ultra is likely to keep its iconic boxy look. But those annoying sharp corners might get a much-needed rounding off for better comfort.</p><p>While the leaker didn&apos;t dive into design details, the rumored shift in corner design aligns with previous claims. Talks of a revamped Ultra model, including changes to the bezels and frame, have been making the rounds on the web.</p><p>This potential update aims to address user feedback and enhance the overall experience. The S24 Ultra&apos;s sharp corners have been reported to cause discomfort, especially during prolonged use.</p><p>Adding rounded corners to the Galaxy S25 Ultra might not be a radical change for Samsung, especially since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and S24 Plus already feature them. If anything, this move promotes a cohesive design across the S25 series, unifying the design language of Samsung&apos;s flagship line.</p><p>Despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series&apos; expected January launch, some details are already surfacing. Recent leaks hint at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fresh-leak-suggests-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-get-a-major-camera-boost">possible upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Ultra&apos;s rear camera</a>, with rumors of a resolution boost. Rumor also has it that the upcoming Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-nano-v2-galaxy-s25-report-claim">will use Google&apos;s next-gen on-device AI model, Gemini Nano 2</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I don&apos;t normally use cases with my phones; I just don&apos;t like the way they feel, and even thin cases tend to add weight and bulk to a device. Given that I switch phones every two weeks on average, it doesn&apos;t make sense to attach a case either. The only outlier to this rule is the iPhone; I&apos;ve been using an iPhone as my secondary phone for nearly five years now, and as there&apos;s only one model a year, it&apos;s in continuous use — unlike most Android phones.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that iPhones are significantly costlier than their Android counterparts in this side of the world. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> costs $415 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-camera-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, and it just seemed prudent to use a case. Doing so makes using the iPhone 15 Pro Max that much easier; I don&apos;t like the flat sides of the device, and a case allows it to be that much more comfortable to hold. </p><p>The only Android phone that merits this treatment is the Pixel; I switch back to the current-gen Pixel throughout the course of the year, and I&apos;m just not confident in Google&apos;s build quality, so it also gets a case. Anyway, you&apos;re not here to learn how I use phones; you want to see which is the best case for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, so let&apos;s get started.</p><p>I reached out to Spigen, Caseology, Peak Design, Casetify, and Mujjo, and got 12 cases in total to use with the device. Additionally, Apple sent two cases along with the phone, including the FineWoven option and a wallet case, but they&apos;re not as good as third-party cases, so I won&apos;t highlight them.</p>
<h2 id="everyday-case-by-peak-design-best-overall-2">Everyday Case by Peak Design: Best overall</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VF6nWUERcdpwtLE7vnGhoE" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-3.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VF6nWUERcdpwtLE7vnGhoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like Peak Design&apos;s tech bag and accessories, so it was a natural choice to test the brand&apos;s Everyday Case. The case is made out of a nylon canvas fabric shell and feels great to hold and use, but it adds considerable bulk to the device. It has raised edges at the front that ensure the screen isn&apos;t damaged should the phone take a tumble, and the buttons have excellent tactility.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KPvrKLrAnK7Q9YiQTzRjAF" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-4.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KPvrKLrAnK7Q9YiQTzRjAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is a MagSafe case, so if you have any attachments, you can easily slot those in without any issues. The best part of the Everyday Case is that it uses Peak Design&apos;s innovative mounting system (called SlimLink), allowing you to attach a diverse set of accessories and mounts to the back of the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>

<p>It is a unique differentiator, and having used the case with a few accessories over the last six months, it is now my go-to choice. The only issue I have with the case is that it extends out a bit over the USB-C port, so you can&apos;t use USB-C cables with wide connectors.</p>
<p>I got the Everyday Case in Sage, but it is also available in four other color options, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Mobile-Everyday-Compatible/dp/B0CSCNF228">retailing at $49</a>, it is a great choice if you want a durable case with extensibility. I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-pixel-8-pro-cases">same case with my Pixel 8 Pro</a> as well, and it is just as great. </p>

<p>Mujjo makes the best leather cases, and the brand outdid itself with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The Full Leather Case feels exquisite to use, and it is incredibly light. The case has a leather finish on all sides, and you get microfiber lining on the inside along with a polycarbonate shell.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DGE7QreVRX8MzafzbnfNdH" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-9.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DGE7QreVRX8MzafzbnfNdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mujjo went with metal buttons, and they have great tactility. The only drawback is that the Action button is covered up, but other than that, I couldn&apos;t find any faults with this Mujjo case. It also has raised edges, but they don&apos;t extend out as much, and it works seamlessly with any MagSafe accessories.</p>

<p>I used the leather case for a few months after getting it, and if it weren&apos;t for the added versatility of the Everyday Case, this would still be on my iPhone 15 Pro Max. I got the burgundy variant of the case, but that&apos;s sold out at Mujjo at the moment; the plus side is that the available colors are on sale, and you can get the leather case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mujjo.com/collections/iphone-15-pro-max/products/full-leather-case-for-iphone-15-pro-max?variant=43919844737272">for as low as $41</a>. If you prefer wallet cases, Mujjo also makes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mujjo.com/collections/iphone-15-pro-max/products/full-leather-magsafe-wallet-case-for-iphone-15-pro-max">leather wallet case</a>, and that is available in burgundy.</p>

<p>I always recommend Spigen whenever someone asks for a clear case recommendation; the brand does these better than most, and it has a great selection for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I&apos;m partial to the Ultra Hybrid Zero One for obvious reasons — the case just looks plain cool, and it does a great job highlighting the innards of the iPhone.</p>

<p>It is incredibly slim and light, the clear sides accentuate the titanium chassis of the phone well, and the case retains its clear design without any yellowing even with extended use. It also has strong magnets, and pairs well with any MagSafe accessory. The only quibble is that the sides are glossy; the back itself has a matte texture and is great to hold, and it would have been better if the sides had the same coating.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I don&apos;t have any issues with this case, and if you want a clear case that stands out a bit, the Ultra Hybrid Zero One is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Anti-Yellowing-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CB775ZNS">no-brainer at its sale price of $21</a>. If you want a regular clear case, the Ultra Hybrid S is my recommendation. It is a great way to showcase the design of the phone, and there&apos;s a built-in kickstand as well. Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Anti-Yellowing-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S8F1VD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3LE9R0EGQF31A&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.G_FpcKjD_M2x1E2acq3C2nAlOdZyaF3SwNYXPbhknBDWx_mrfwJ6g-jsfwhDkYtQkaVof4KS-uUJlktej9K7jHY9k197Nf-FYRKnECqENGmKhaNl6ndUkPQM1kvi4uJxL0tjzj2zE4-_RmBhhr0WGxTETBnPNNflYW1WlvS03_pC0accTQ-amq7tZNOfDNkZ3jCMXyocbx049CStXc7emv6VRQtDpKLVfithaMAtn8o.ahNVEGYOEhKpduj4vcTbnxV88QP73Oaub1uM3YLoh9A&dib_tag=se&keywords=spigen%2Bultra%2Bhybrid%2Bs%2Biphone%2B15%2Bpro%2Bmax&qid=1719546380&sprefix=Ultra%2BHybrid%2BS%2B%2Caps%2C308&sr=8-3&th=1">at just $25</a>, it is a standout value.</p>

<p>If you need rugged protection, the Enzo Aramid case utilizes a combination of TPU with Aramid to deliver standout durability. It doesn&apos;t add much bulk to the phone, but it has noticeable heft, and you get metal buttons on the sides that have good tactility. The inside of the case is lined with microfiber, and its magnets are just as strong as the Ultra Hybrid Zero One. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CBD34N2V">costlier at $39</a>, but still a decent choice considering what&apos;s on offer.</p>

<p>Caseology is a Spigen subsidiary, and it makes colorful cases that stand out. I used the Parallax Mag and NanoPop Mag cases with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I prefer the former. It has a textured finish at the back that makes it easy to hold, but what I like best is that the sides also get a textured design. This makes all the difference in daily use, and the case itself is thin and light.</p><p>And at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Enhanced-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0C641NM3Z">just $20</a>, it is a great bargain. I got the case in Midnight Blue, but it is also available in black and burgundy. As the name suggests, the case is designed to be used with MagSafe accessories, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this area.</p>
<h2 id="which-iphone-15-pro-max-case-should-you-buy-2">Which iPhone 15 Pro Max case should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VMWXcSiNpcnLWUsbiBPTXJ" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-20.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VMWXcSiNpcnLWUsbiBPTXJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you just want a versatile case that does it all, my pick would be the Everyday Case by Peak Design. It is on the bulkier side as these things go, but you get excellent protection, and the ability to mount accessories is an added bonus. Similarly, if you&apos;re looking to get a leather case, your search ends with Mujjo; the brand is the best in this regard, and the Full Leather Case is a terrific choice.</p><p>I got Casetify&apos;s cases as well, but the build quality isn&apos;t quite on par with the rest of the picks I highlighted above, and they don&apos;t measure up to long-term use. So for any general-use cases — like Aramid-based choices or clear designs — you should just go with Spigen — the Ultra Hybrid Zero One series is gorgeous, and it accentuates the iPhone 15 Pro Max incredibly well.</p>

<ul><li>An interview between Qualcomm's SVP and General Manager of Handsets, Chris Patrick, shed light on its efforts to make Android updates easier for OEMs.</li><li>Patrick detailed that Qualcomm has taken strides to optimize the internal code and machinery of its SoCs to reduce the problems OEMs may face.</li><li>Patrick teased that there will be more on the matter "later this year," which could be highlighted during its next Summit in Hawaii in October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New information highlights Qualcomm&apos;s new efforts to solve the problem behind slow Android updates from OEMs with extensive product libraries.</p><p>According to an interview between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-updates-oems-2024-3455346/">Android Authority</a> and Qualcomm&apos;s SVP and General Manager of Handsets, Chris Patrick, help is on the way. Patrick informed the publication that "it is very complicated for a customer — an OEM — to get security updates, to get Android version updates, and then get it to every end user."</p><p>One of the many causes for slow update reception is older chipsets within an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. Typically, as with any piece of technology, the older the piece, the less likely support will be maintained. This causes a disconnect between the user and the OEM providing the Android update.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s Chris Patrick stated that a phone&apos;s SoC isn&apos;t the <em>only </em>culprit, but it does contribute, which is why they&apos;ve "been working on for the past several years with Google and with the OEMs is to change the structure of inline code." As a result, Patrick is hopeful that the changes will aid OEMs in keeping more of their product catalogs up-to-date in a closer timeframe.</p><p>The company teased more "code optimization" information to come, but that won&apos;t happen until "later this year." Moreover, as the publication noted, Qualcomm&apos;s improvements won&apos;t magically see the adoption of five or seven-year update support for devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">what Google promised users</a>.</p><p>To Patrick, the company&apos;s changes should at least make it <em>easier </em>for Android updates to flow rather than constricting what&apos;s possible software-wise.</p><p>Following Google&apos;s update support announcement, Samsung started to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-expand-security-updates-beyond-5-years">ponder a similar route</a>. The Korean OEM typically supported its higher-tier devices for four years, delivering major Android OS updates alongside five years of security patches. Both areas see importance as the former brings new features and refreshments while the latter strengthens devices against online dangers.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">ended up following in Google&apos;s footsteps</a> as its recent launch of the Galaxy S24 series promises seven years of Android updates and security patches.</p><p>What&apos;s important here is Qualcomm&apos;s teaser of more to come later in 2024. The company is expected to host its next summit in Hawaii in October. There, we&apos;ll hear about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> SoC. It&apos;s unclear if Qualcomm has plugged these machinery upgrades into its next flagship chip. However, its general manager&apos;s words give hope.</p>

It can already replace Google Assistant as the default voice assistant, and a recent update made it possible to use Gemini in Google Messages.</p><p>This means users will be able to interact with the chatbot directly from their messaging app without having to invoke the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> or even set it as their default assistant (in case you prefer to stick with Google Assistant). It&apos;s a very handy way to provoke more people to use the chatbot as Google continues to enhance the experience.</p><p>With that said, accessing Gemini in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> is pretty straightforward. Here&apos;s how you can get started. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-gemini-in-google-messages-2">How to use Gemini in Google Messages</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages</strong> app on your phone.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Start Chat</strong> button in the bottom right corner.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Gemini </strong>from the list.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.03%;"><img id="TVfhkELZRDMNo2m7jyLx7b" name="how-to-use-gemini-in-google-messages-steps-1.jpg" alt="How to use Gemini in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TVfhkELZRDMNo2m7jyLx7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2021" height="2244" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. When prompted, tap the <strong>Continue </strong>button.</p><p>5. Read through the Gemini in Google Messages overview and tap the <strong>I agree</strong> button.</p><p>6. <strong>Start chatting</strong> with Gemini!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3034px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.96%;"><img id="hCUYpHgCNT3ftjA3GXa3Tb" name="how-to-use-gemini-in-google-messages-steps-2.jpg" alt="How to use Gemini in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCUYpHgCNT3ftjA3GXa3Tb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3034" height="2244" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the time of writing, Google is rolling out a new way to make it even easier to use Gemini in Google Messages. A server-side update is on its way, bringing with it a new floating button that appears above the New Chat button in the bottom right corner. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1079px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="RU9QtwoRaeWNYog8BSFNxa" name="new-gemini-button-in-google-messages.png" alt="New Gemini button in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RU9QtwoRaeWNYog8BSFNxa.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1079" height="605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This lets you skip a couple of taps if you want to pick up where you left off or start a new conversation, without scrolling through the never-ending list of chats and groups. </p>
<h2 id="using-gemini-can-be-really-helpful-2">Using Gemini can be really helpful</h2>
<p>Provided that it&apos;s available on your phone, being able to use Gemini in Google Messages can come in really handy. It&apos;s essentially no different than if you were to use the standalone Gemini app from the Play Store.</p><p>However, by making it accessible within the Messages app, you can treat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> just like any other text conversation. It can help you figure out what to make for dinner, create plans for an upcoming trip, and you can even ask questions about a picture that you took. Best of all, it&apos;s completely free to use, as this new functionality isn&apos;t hidden behind a paywall like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-one-gemini-advanced-family-access">Gemini Advanced</a>.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-use-gemini-in-google-messages-2">Who can use Gemini in Google Messages?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, being able to use Gemini in Google Messages isn&apos;t currently available with all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, and there are still some imposed limitations, which are laid out on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/14599070">Google&apos;s support page</a>.</p>
<ul><li>Android device with 6GB of RAM or higher.</li><li>Your phone's language set to a supported language.</li><li>A personal Google Account that you manage on your own.</li><li>Be 18 or over.</li><li>RCS chats turned on.</li></ul>
<p>Although there&apos;s no specific mention of being limited to certain brands of devices, there does seem to be some gate-keeping afoot or perhaps just a slow rollout amid relaxed requirements. At the time of this writing, Gemini in Google Messages appears on our Pixel phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-a-week-with-the-z-fold-5-coming-home">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>. However, it doesn&apos;t seem to be available on other phones that meet the requirements, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> or the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Razr Plus 2024</a>. Still, we expect this will likely change in the coming weeks or months, likely via a server-side update.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Now that the 2024 Motorola Razr family is here, it&apos;s already time to start looking ahead to the Motorola Razr Plus 2025. It may seem early, but chances are, Motorola is already developing and testing next year&apos;s model with better specs, a newer chipset, and potentially updated designs.</p><p>Since it&apos;s still quite early to speculate on specific hardware or updates, we&apos;ll focus instead on what we <em>want</em> to see on the Razr Plus 2025, based on my first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">hands-on impressions of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>. This year&apos;s phone is already an upgrade over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a>, but some of Motorola&apos;s choices have us already looking ahead to 2025 for 3rd-gen fixes.</p>
<h2 id="a-truly-flagship-chipset-2">A truly flagship chipset</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kh8dGGQbfRbLbXSwXYZGJa" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Gen-4-Oryon-teaser.jpg" alt="Qualcomm teasing Oryon cores for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kh8dGGQbfRbLbXSwXYZGJa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance hasn&apos;t really been an issue with the most recent Razr phones. The 2023 model does fairly well, considering it uses a slightly older chip than many of its direct competitors, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. That said, it&apos;s a half-step between the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and the more powerful 8 Gen 2, and it&apos;s the latter chip that the Razr was really competing with, making the phone feel a bit underpowered.</p><p>With the Razr Plus 2024, Motorola opted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, which is a toned-down version of the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. It still offers plenty of AI capabilities, but not as many as the 8 Gen 3, nor does it offer things like 8K video recording for those who care about that. So once again, Motorola went for the option that feels half a step behind its competitors.</p><p>It&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing, and the 8s Gen 3 is still a very capable chipset that proved to work well on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a>, but I would love to see the Razr Plus 2025 launch with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, tapping into all the capabilities that the new Oryon cores will offer.</p>
<h2 id="more-camera-improvements-2">More camera improvements</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="S8xDDjsbgjzBr33xC4myiV" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-02.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8xDDjsbgjzBr33xC4myiV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The jury is still out on whether or not Motorola&apos;s new camera system is the bee&apos;s knees, but the new 50MP primary sensor and Image Enhancement Engine should work wonders for images and result in an output that&apos;s better than what we got with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>. That said, the setup on the Razr Plus 2024 is quite unique, as the company ditched the ultrawide sensor for a 2x telephoto camera, with the aim of capturing better portraits.</p><p>It&apos;s an interesting move, to say the least, and one that not everyone will be happy with, especially with the cheaper Razr 2024 sporting an ultrawide sensor.</p><p>Ideally, we could get the best of both worlds, and Motorola would give us three rear sensors on the Razr Plus 2025. At the moment, it&apos;s still fairly uncommon to find three cameras on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, let alone a telephoto lens, but it&apos;s not completely unheard of: The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-pocket-2-launch">Huawei Pocket 2</a> has four rear cameras, including a 8MP 3x telephoto lens.</p><p>Having three cameras means Motorola would likely have to change its design a bit to accommodate, especially if it wants to retain the massive cover display.</p>
<h2 id="tone-down-the-cover-screen-2">Tone down the cover screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rGwGHzDny625oebApQjdCk" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Razr-2024-2.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rGwGHzDny625oebApQjdCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cover screen is by far the best thing about the Razr Plus 2023, but there&apos;s no doubt that it was overpowered, sporting a high pixel density and a 144Hz refresh rate. For such a small display, that seemed like overkill, especially on a phone whose battery life was sub-par at best. One reason to use the smaller display is to reframe from using up so much battery, but pushing all those pixels seems a bit counterintuitive.</p><p>The new Razr Plus 2024 addresses this somewhat by implementing an LTPO display. This means it should be able to drop down to low refresh rates when necessary, like when viewing static content, thus preserving battery life.</p><p>That&apos;s fine and dandy, but on such a small display, a 165Hz panel seems entirely too powerful for what most people will be doing on it. And let&apos;s face it: gaming and watching movies are still better experiences on the main display. Motorola should just lower the cover screen refresh rate to 90Hz, as it did on the cheaper Razr 2024, as it will still provide a smoother experience without using as much battery power. Either that or Motorola should at least provide the option to change the cover screen refresh rate separately from the main display.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-software-promise-2">A better software promise</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-03.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 main display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola has improved somewhat on the software front, but the company is still far behind its biggest competitors. Last year&apos;s Razr Plus is set to receive three OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security updates, which matches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">Razr Plus 2024 software promise</a>. That&apos;s not bad at all, even if it&apos;s below the seven years promised by Samsung and Google for their latest phones. The problem is that at the time of writing, last year&apos;s model is still waiting on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, while just about every major OEM (including Sony) has updated their 2023 flagships to the latest version.</p><p>To give Motorola credit, the company has been pretty spot on with its bi-monthly updates, but when paying $1000 for a phone, we should not have to wait this long for major software updates to arrive.</p><p>Motorola should strive to do much better with the Razr Plus 2025, offering longer software support and pushing updates faster. It would be nice to see the company participate in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">Android beta programs</a> more widely, as to give more users an avenue to try out the latest version before the stable update launches.</p>
<h2 id="accessories-2">Accessories</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UoWnVMwezqTzsMazhPSTHZ" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024and-Razr-2024-case-and-strap.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 with cases on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UoWnVMwezqTzsMazhPSTHZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola is starting to really make a splash with the Razr series, but it feels like the company isn&apos;t leaning into accessories as much as it should. The 2023 model didn&apos;t have much in the way of first-party cases, and it took me quite a few tries to find a third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-and-razr-screen-protectors">Razr Plus 2023 screen protector</a> that I really liked.</p><p>This year, Motorola is launching new first-party cases that will let you add straps so you can carry the phone like a purse. I love the idea, and it&apos;s the type of fun accessory option I want to see the company lean more into. In addition to first-party cases, Motorola should partner with more accessory makers to expand on the possibilities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/thinborne-google-pixel-8-pro-aramid-fiber-case">Thinborne makes some of the best cases around</a>, as they&apos;re thin and durable, and some even support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones" target="_blank">MagSafe accessories</a>. I would love to see more case makers give us options beyond Samsung and Google, and as one of the top Android OEMs in North America, Motorola needs to get in on this.</p>

<p>The choice between the Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Edge 2023 is an interesting debate. The former was just introduced in June 2024, while the Edge 2023 was introduced in October 2023, which was not that long ago. Is it worth upgrading already, or should you opt for the newer of the two for any specific reason? We’ll walk you through everything you need to know about both phones to help you decide.</p>

<p>If you were to just glance at these two phones, they might look to be one in the same in many respects. But they are different from one another in subtle ways when it comes to the look. </p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 comes in one finish, Midnight Blue. It has a 6.55-inch curved, edge-to-edge 2,400 x 1,080 FHD+ pOLED with 144Hz refresh rate and 1,300 nits peak brightness. Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge 2024 review</a> that it’s plenty bright when using the phone under direct sunlight. </p><p>A customizable side Quick Button can be used to access frequently used functions through Motorola Smart Connect, and Sutrich says this feature helped him streamline his usual routines. </p><p>The back is covered in the vegan leather Motorola loves so much for its devices. The vegan leather back offers a nice grip. Sutrich says the phone’s design shines through every square inch, from the high-quality metal frame to the slip-resistant vegan leather back, and it’s also surprisingly thin. </p><p>Thanks to an IP68 water and dust resistance rating and a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen, the phone is pretty durable, too. With 256GB of built-in storage, it has a 5,000mAh battery that Motorola says affords up to 36 hours (that’s three days!) of battery life per charge. It also charges super-quickly at 68W TurboPower (with an optional charger) and supports 15W wireless charging. Sutrich found it lasts all day and then some and charges rapidly. </p><p>There’s also an on-screen fingerprint button that uses optical sensing to read your fingerprint through the display. You won’t get a headphone jack with this phone, and it has USB-C along with 5G connectivity, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC, and Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>Available in Eclipse Black, the previous-generation Motorola Edge 2023 also has curved edges that wrap around its slightly larger 6.6-inch pOLED screen. It has the same resolution at 2,400 x 1,080 along with the same 144Hz refresh rate, but brightness taps out at 1,200 nits. </p><p>With the same vegan leather back and 256GB storage, the Motorola Edge 2023 is slightly slimmer and more lightweight. It also has a smaller 4,400mAh battery though it still supports 68W TurboPower charging (with a separately purchased charger) as well as 15W wireless charging. So, it is rated to last for just over a day per charge. </p><p>This phone is also IP68-rated for water and dust resistance. The screen is made of curved 3D glass with an anti-fingerprint coating, so it may not be quite as durable as the newer model. It, too, has an on-screen fingerprint button. With USB-C, 5G, NFC, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 5.2 in the Motorola Edge 2023, there’s nothing strikingly different when it comes to the basics between these two phones.</p>

<p>Let’s break things down by looking at a side-by-side comparison of the core specs of these two phones.</p>

<p>There are some key differences here between these two phones, but a lot of similarities, too.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-edge-2024-vs-edge-2023-the-key-features-2">Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Edge 2023: The key features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-home-pink.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that we have covered the basics let’s look at how these two phones compare on a performance level. </p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> processor, making it a more powerful phone. Sutrich says it’s efficient and doesn’t get very hot, even when playing games like <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em> for up to an hour at a time. But you won’t see as much detail and resolution in the picture, and the framerate isn’t as good as you’d enjoy with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. Nonetheless, he says gaming was a “surprisingly great experience.” </p><p>It has 8GB RAM with RAM Boost you can use as needed for more intense activities, like gaming. Loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, the Motorola Edge 2024 comes with features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> that lets you disable certain features and apps for downtime. It also has a Family Space so you can set limits if the phone is being used by a child. </p><p>Sutrich notes that the haptic quality of this phone is not great compared to others, making it seem cheaper than even phones from other brands in the same price class, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. The processor is also slower by “quite a wide margin,” he says. According to GeekBench 6.3 tests, the Google Pixel 8a is 140% faster, and the OnePlus 12R is almost twice as fast. This is a huge factor to consider if you’re a power user of any kind. </p><p>With ThinkShield security, dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and Snapdragon Sound, the Motorola Edge 2024 is a fairly basic, mid-range device. There’s nothing particularly notable about the phone, nor features that will blow you away.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjeGUDNmznRWN3JohQvsGZ" name="motorola edge 2023 pocket.jpg" alt="Motorola Edge 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjeGUDNmznRWN3JohQvsGZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Powered by a less powerful MediaTek Dimensity 7030 processor, the Motorola Edge 2023 also has features like ThinkShield Security and a Moto Secure secret folder to house sensitive information. It, too, has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and has one extra mic at three versus just two with the Motorola Edge 2024, an odd downgrade with the newer phone. </p><p>This phone runs the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> OS, but it supports two OS updates and three years of bi-monthly security updates. That’s not a lot compared to other phone brands. Counting Android 14, you’ll only get one more OS update. The Motorola Edge 2024 offers the same OS upgrade and security update path, but you’ll at least be safe up to Android 16 with that phone.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-edge-2024-vs-edge-2023-the-cameras-2">Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Edge 2023: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VywRX6HUYWoYMiCg7r2A83" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-camera-island-03.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VywRX6HUYWoYMiCg7r2A83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to photography, the cameras appear to be on par with one another in both phones. They both have a 50MP main camera along with a 13MP ultra-wide camera and 32MP front camera. Both also incorporate AI camera features. These include being able to keep shots steady while moving, instant all-pixel focus, adjustable focal length, and background blur. </p><p>It isn’t so much picture quality that Sutrich had issues with when testing the Motorola Edge 2024 cameras, but rather the speed. The camera is slow to launch and feels clunky. Photo capture is slow as well, with a lot of odd shutter lag. You won’t be able to get those quick and candid moments as you would with other phones. </p><p>The camera in the Motorola Edge 2024 doesn’t handle motion capture very well either, Sutrich found, though he’s noticed the same limitation with other phones in this class, too. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that the cameras are nothing to write home about. You’ll get decent shots for sharing via social media, but they don’t rival other phones in their class in terms of photography prowess.</p>

<p>Between the Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Edge 2023, you should buy the newer Motorola Edge 2024. But considering Sutrich’s experiences, you might be better off to steer clear of<em> both</em> these phones and opt for something more feature-rich and powerful in the same price class. </p><p>If you’re not set on Motorola, the Google Pixel 8a is a better option that sells for about the same price and offers plenty more features along with better cameras, a better processor than both, and lots of Google Gemini Pixel features. (You can see our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a">Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a</a> guide for a more detailed breakdown.) Another option to consider is the OnePlus 12R, which is cheaper, has a more powerful processor, a better display, faster charging, and more. </p><p>It should be noted that both those alternative phones also offer software and security updates for a much longer timeframe, Google with an impressive seven years for both and OnePlus with four. </p><p>If neither of those phones tickles your fancy, you’ll find many options on the list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best affordable Android phones</a>, including ones that may cost less and others that fall into the same price point. </p><p>Both the Motorola Edge 2024 and Motorola Edge 2023 are decent devices that will meet the needs of casual users. But given the high price points, you can get something much better for the same, or even less, than either of these phones.</p>

<p>The Motorola Edge 2024 is a valiant effort in the mid-range phone category for the company, but it doesn’t quite live up to other phones in the same price range in terms of cameras, processing power, and slick features. You would be better off going for a phone like the Google Pixel 8a or OnePlus 12R that sells for about the same (or less) and offers better bang for your buck.</p></p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cost-2">How much does the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 cost?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a starting price of $999.99 for the 256GB version and $1,119.99 for the 512GB. That&apos;s the same price that we saw for the phone&apos;s predecessor, the Z Flip 4, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>, which is the Flip 5&apos;s biggest competition. </p><p>That&apos;s obviously pretty pricey for a smartphone, which is why the deals above are so important. It&apos;s worth noting that more offers are likely to launch in the coming weeks, so bookmark this page and check back later if none of the current deals are working for you. </p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-specs-of-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-2">What are the specs of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5?</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5 comes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s23-series-snapdragon-8-gen-2-exclusively-win-samsung-qualcomm">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor</a>, the same chip that powers the excellent S23 series. That includes the S23 Ultra, which is arguably the most powerful phone on the market today. </p><p>You&apos;re also getting a pair of vibrant AMOLED displays on the inside and outside of the new phone, plus some flagship-level camera tech. The Z Flip 5 also has a 3,700mAh battery, which is a bit smaller than we expected, but the efficient processor should help a bit on that front. </p><p>Of course, the main selling point of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 will be its folding screen. Both the Z Fold 5 and the Flip are adopting the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-5-display-durability-testing">waterdrop hinge</a> approach, which gives the phones some added durability and allow them to almost fold completely flat. All in all, it seems like the Z Flip 5 is setting up to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of the year.</p>
<h2 id="when-does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-come-out-2">When does the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 come out?</h2>
<p>Although nothing has been confirmed just yet, a bounty of leaks and rumors have suggested that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> (along with the Galaxy Z Fold 6) will be announced during the Samsung Unpacked event on July 10th. If this occurs, it usually takes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> about two weeks to hit store shelves after their initial reveal, suggesting that the Z Flip 6 could be available as soon as July 24th, 2024.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in Samsung&apos;s newest foldable phones, it&apos;s worth noting that the company is already offering $50 of credit to customers who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w"><strong>reserve a preorder through the Galaxy Reserve program</strong></a>. All you need to provide is your name and phone number and you&apos;re under no obligation to go through with the transaction if you change your mind after seeing the phones. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest Play Services is heavily focused on its digital Wallet app, adding a new card on Fitbit as its payment service prepares to conclude.</p><p>As detailed in its System <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">patch notes</a>, Google Play Services <strong>version 24.25</strong> brings Wallet support for American Express cards on Fitbit devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/26/fitbit-google-wallet-american-express/">9to5Google</a>). The update extends Wallet updates to Android devices, with the company stating new features have arrived for users adding an ID to their digital wallet.</p><p>Wallet on Android picks up Pix support as an alternative payment method for shoppers. Additionally, users receive support for adding an e-wallet as a payment method through Google Wallet.</p><p>Alternatively, users can use a paired e-wallet in Google Pay to complete a transaction.</p><p>These new features for Wallet on Android and the new card support in Fitbit Pay rolling out and should soon become more widely available.</p><p>Google&apos;s newfound American Express support for Fitbit users arrives as the company is preparing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-pay-shut-down-later-2024-detailed">conclude Fitbit Pay services</a> in July. The company informed users via an email in May that Google Wallet will succeed all Fitbit Pay app functions on the wearable company&apos;s devices on July 29.</p><p>Google stated that the movie should "benefit" the user as it opens up a portfolio containing around 5,000 supported banks and cards to add. Fitbit Pay&apos;s impending shutdown will affect the following devices: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-charge-5-review">Charge 5</a>, Charge 4, Charge 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a>, Sense, Versa 4, Versa 3, Versa 2, and the Versa.</p><p>Fitbit encourages users to begin transferring their paired cards and banks to Wallet ahead of the July 29 cut-off date. Users have retained the ability to utilize the Fitbit Pay app on their trackers and watches since May. However, the option to add cards was removed.</p><p>Google&apos;s absorption of Fitbit into its ecosystem continues as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-redirects-fitbit-store-purchases">recently shut down</a> the wearable&apos;s standalone online store.</p>
