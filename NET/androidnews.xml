                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've lost count of the number of chargers I have in the house. I got everything from tiny 20W GaN chargers to gargantuan charging stations that go up to 300W, alongside the monstrosities that OnePlus and Vivo bundle with their phones. While it's obviously great to have choices, I only really use two chargers on a daily basis: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-200w-review">Nexode 200W charging station</a> is handy at charging up to six devices at once, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">Nexode Pro 160W</a> is what I use in the bedroom to charge phones and smartwatches. <br><br>If you just want something that you can use on your desk, the Nexode 200W is a decent choice, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Nexode-200W-Desktop-Charger/dp/B09MGRNYHH">down to $97</a> now. But if you've also amassed a collection of chargers over the years and just want one that handles everything, you should pick up the Nexode Pro 160W. It usually costs $119, but the charger is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">down to $95 for Cyber Monday</a>, and while that's still quite a lot of cash to put toward an accessory, it is the best all-in-one GaN charger I've used, and it's worth the purchase.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need an all-in-one charger that doesn't take up much room and still manages to charge all of your tech. I used the Nexode Pro 160W for a year now, and it has been faultless. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't need 140W charging. If you want a 100W GaN charger instead, I recommend this Anker charger instead, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-GaNPrime-Compact-Foldable/dp/B09W2PNLX7">now available for $59</a>.</p>
<p>The Nexode Pro 160W is smaller than any of the other 140W GaN chargers I tested, and the foldable pins make it a great choice if you need to take it on the road. I used this charger every day throughout 2024, and didn't run into any issues whatsoever. I charged over a hundred different devices in that time — including 70 or so Android phones, a dozen tablets, my Steam Deck, and a smorgasbord of accessories. <br><br>It uses the USB PD 3.1 protocol to deliver 140W of power to the primary USB-C port, with the secondary USB-C port going up to 100W, and the third hitting 30W. When the two main USB-C ports are in use, you get 100W out of one and 60W out the other, and the 160W power budget should be ideal to charge a notebook and phone or any accessory like a Steam Deck, which only needs 35W. <br><br>With all ports in simultaneous use, you get a total power budget of 135W, with 65W each going to the primary USB-C ports, and 15W split evenly between the third USB-C and USB-A ports. Basically, you can charge a phone, notebook, smartwatch, and any other accessory just with a single charger. While there are dozens of products that do the same, the Nexode Pro 160W has been the most reliable in my testing, and with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">discount to $95</a>, it is a smidgen more affordable, and that's always a good thing.</p>

There are plenty of great options out there, like this large <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-cant-live-without-this-25-000mah-power-bank-and-now-its-cheaper-than-its-ever-been-for-black-friday">25,000mAh UGREEN power bank with 145W charging</a>. However, you always have to take size into consideration, and the more capacity a power bank has, the larger it'll be. That's why I love this Anker Nano Power Bank (30W), which is on sale for Black Friday/Cyber Monday with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9CJKCH3/">25% discount</a>.</p><p>The Anker Nano Power Bank (30W) normally sells for $39.99, which already isn't bad for what you get. But for Black Friday/Cyber Monday, this 25% off deal brings it down to $29.99, a small but welcome discount for a surprisingly versatile power bank.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a power bank with plenty of power and easy portability thanks to its small size and looping USB-C cord.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want something that charges faster than 30W and has a larger capacity than 10,000mAh.</p><p>There's a lot to like about the Anker Nano Power Bank. The 10,000mAh capacity means I can charge my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-motorola-razr-plus-2024-deal-is-wild">Razr Plus 2024</a> at least twice, making it more than enough for me on any given day, particularly when at conventions and such. Then there's the fact that it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c" target="_blank">USB-C</a> and USB-A port since the former is the new standard, and the latter is still pretty common (just ask OnePlus).</p><p>The best part is that the attached USB-C cable loops into the device, making the power bank easy to carry around, whether that's just in your hand or looped onto your bag. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable chargers and power banks</a> go, it's incredibly convenient, as is the mini display on the side of the device that tells you how much time is left to charge your phone and how much capacity remains in the charger.</p><p>The 30W charging speed is also fast enough for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ditch-your-boring-phone-for-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-now-more-than-usd300-off">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> (25W) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-amazon-black-friday-sale-has-finally-fixed-the-google-pixel-9s-price-problem">Pixel 9</a> (27W). My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> charges at 45W and would still top up pretty quickly with the Anker Nano Power Bank, which is why I would recommend it to anyone looking for a compact power bank.</p>

However, after reading the reviews, I changed my mind and decided to go for this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXKSCY1G/">Sony ULT Field 1 deal</a> instead.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1</a> was released earlier this year and retails for just $130. That's already not bad, but I prefer to stick to speakers under $100 if I can help it. Fortunately, this Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal brings the price down to $98, which is right at the top of my self-imposed price range (I'm cheap, so what?).</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a portable speaker with great bass, long battery life, and a good design with support for high-quality audio codecs.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the best sound experience and want the option to utilize a 3.5mm audio jack or USB-C connection for audio playback.</p><p>I'm by no means an audiophile, so I see no point in paying top dollar to have the absolute best sound. I was hoping the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVFKZ1LC">UE Boom 4</a> would satisfy my need for a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> to have at get-togethers, as I remember really liking my older UE Boom. That said, Amazon warned me that the product is frequently returned, and upon reading reviews, many people noted that the speaker was pretty lacking when it comes to bass, which is something I <em>do</em> need (a guy's gotta twerk).</p><p>That's when I remembered our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1 review</a>, which was done by Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong. I read through his review, as well as the reviews on Amazon, and decided this is exactly what I need. Granted, he is an audiophile, so his score is lower than the one on Amazon, but poor sound quality is not among his reasons. He notes a lack of USB-C audio and a 3.5mm audio jack as his main negatives.</p><p>As far as audio quality goes, Armstrong says the Sony ULT Field 1 sounds fine but a little flat if the UTL mode is turned off. However, he notes that "turning it on immediately imbues presence and depth to the sound, making the music fuller and more robust close-up and at greater distances like 50 feet." He even says the ULTE Field 1 is his new go-to take-along speaker.</p><p>Others in the Amazon reviews also note how it has good sound quality, with one review highlighting how the speaker is "<strong>LOUDDDDD as hell</strong>." That's all more than enough to convince me that this is the portable speaker that I need to buy.</p>

But it's expensive as hell, even with this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/galaxy-watch-ultra-47mm-titanium-gray-sm-l705udaaxaa/"><strong>$215-off Black Friday deal</strong></a>. Unless you have a good watch to trade in — which can cut the price another $300 — $434 is more than most of you will be willing to pay.</p><p>Looking strictly at Wear OS watches that beat the Galaxy Watch Ultra's 72-hour battery life, you have two main options with major Black Friday discounts: The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-100-Hour-Tracking-Sapphire-Dual-Engine/dp/B0CV5ZG5TC"><strong>OnePlus Watch 2 for $199 ($100 off)</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ticwatch-Pro-Enduro-Smartwatch-Compatible/dp/B0D179VBXY"><strong>TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro for $209 ($140 off)</strong></a> with the Amazon coupon.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> can last anywhere from 90 to 100 hours per charge thanks to some incredible hybrid efficiency, using its special OnePlus-brand coprocessor to power things while barely using battery life. With its RTOS-only mode, its battery jumps to <em>a week</em> while still showing calls and notifications, whereas other low-power modes only show the time.</p>

<p>Then you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, which <em>starts</em> at 90 hours per charge but can last at least a <em>month</em> using its secondary, low-res screen, a trick unique to Mobvoi watches.

<p>If you want a detailed breakdown on how these two watches compare to Samsung's flagship watch, I wrote a guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro">Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, while another colleague wrote how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-oneplus-watch-2">Watch Ultra and OnePlus Watch 2 compare</a>.</p><p>By and large, the Galaxy Watch Ultra <em>is</em> better. It beats the Enduro for faster software updates, Google Assistant support, built-in LTE, and brighter display. But the Enduro is more comfortable to wear and (again) costs so much less while offering most of the same Play Store apps.</p><p>As for the OnePlus Watch 2, it matches the Ultra with dual-band GPS, performance, and durability, while falling a bit short for health accuracy and lacking an LTE option. Neither watch has a working crown, so the TicWatch is your choice if you need one.</p><p>Again, the Galaxy Watch Ultra <em>is</em> better than both of these watches; it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-premium-pick">best premium Android watch</a> thanks to its stylish, rugged titanium frame, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">accurate fitness data</a> backed by Samsung Health, and reliable battery life. The only question is whether you should pay another $250 for it, or if you can happily settle for a OnePlus or TicWatch. If I'm Black Friday deal-hunting, I'm choosing the cheaper option.</p>

<p>It's high time I sorted out my home server mess. I use a couple of ancient desktop PCs in a closet filled with hard drives, and everything is patched together, so I have somewhere to store all of my stuff.</p><p>I also realize I don't need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-black-friday-you-should-get-yourself-a-starter-nas">NAS designed for enterprise speed and multiple users</a> connecting to it at once, but I do need to save as much money as humanly possible. It's just my wife and me here, storing pictures or music along with the occasional document that can't get lost. A Raspberry Pi and a few hard drives are <strong>exactly</strong> what I need, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> is the time to get it all.</p>

<p>You'll need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> to run everything. A model 4 can work, but the newer model 5 is a lot better. We don't need excessive speed, but nobody wants to make things slower on purpose. Unless you already have one up and running, buy a kit. It will come with the board itself, a power supply, a case with heat sinks and a fan, and extras like an SD card and cables. You're going to save some money this way.</p><p>This one has it all, and it's on sale for a great price.</p>

<p>Grab yourself a powered USB Type-A hub, too. A Raspberry Pi is tiny and doesn't have a robust power control circuit, so running everything from the Pi's internal USB power isn't a great idea. Using a powered hub means you're not going to see issues copying files back and forth because there isn't enough juice to go around.</p>

<p>Next is somewhere to put the storage. I'm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-creality-3d-printer-is-usd130-off-and-works-from-my-phone-so-im-buying-it">3D printing</a> an enclosure for everything and using individual SATA to USB cables, but a drive dock is a lot easier. You can connect multiple storage drives using one USB cable, which can add up to a ton of storage.</p><p>Buying something like this one from MAIWO means you can mix and match 2.5 and 3.5-inch drives, and there's even a built-in drive cloning feature for when you decide to go bigger.</p><p>When all is said and done you'll have this dock and your Raspberry Pi case beside it so you won't need much room for it all.</p>

<p>With room for four hard drives, you're going to need at least one. Most people choose spinning disk drives rather than solid-state drives for storage because they have higher capacities and cost less. Since you're not trying to run applications from the drive, speed isn't as important, and the cost-benefit makes it well worth the trade-off.</p><p>I already bought some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Performance-Gaming-Internal-Drive/dp/B07N8WTFBY">12TB drives </a>over the summer because I knew I was going to do this, but to get started these 6TB drives are great. The Black Friday sale price can't be beat, either.</p><p>Whether you spend $150 bucks on a Raspberry Pi and HDD dock or $500 on a NAS from a company like Synology you're going to have to buy the hard drives.</p>
<hr>
<p>Putting it together is easy. Follow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html">an online guide</a> to get your Raspberry Pi up and running once you've put the kit together. Connect the USB hub to the Pi and a wall socket, connect the HDD bay to the Hub and a wall socket, plug in your drives, and turn it all on.</p><p>You don't need any special NAS software because everything you need to share a drive across your home network (or the internet!) is built into the Raspberry Pi's operating system.</p><p>Use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/samba-file-server">online tutorial to set up Samba</a> for sharing, and make sure you mind your permissions. Once that's done, your files and folders stored on your homemade NAS will show up through the standard Windows, Mac, and iOS "files" application, and there are plenty of Android file apps that can connect to network-shared storage.</p><p>Of course, you can go a step further and set up something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/plex">Plex</a> or a network-aware music player on the Raspberry Pi and do more than just store stuff. You can even install OMV, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.openmediavault.org/">a NAS operating system</a> on the Pi, and get all the features you'll find on expensive models, too.</p><p>Enjoy doing it yourself and saving a boatload of money. I do ☺️.</p>

Even if it's for something that you never even considered but were enticed by the idea of saving money, we've all been there and fallen victim to it before, and while we tell ourselves it won't happen again, it always does.</p><p>Two categories of devices that we ALWAYS see this with are Chromebooks and tablets. You might see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-is-practically-giving-away-its-latest-chromebook-for-cyber-monday">Chromebook for under $100</a> or a tablet for $25 and immediately add them to your cart or hit the "Buy Now" button. Amazon is notorious for this, as you used to be able to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/this-perfect-portable-companion-tablet-is-only-50-bucks-during-prime-day-but-youre-running-out-of-time">Fire 7</a> for dirt cheap. But the truth is that practically nobody should actually buy the Fire 7.</p><p>If someone tries to give one to you, tell them thanks but no thanks. Or politely accept it and then take it to somewhere nearby that responsibly recycles electronics.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Cyber Monday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare">Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals<br></a>-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-motorola-deals-2024-historic-razr-savings-usd150-off-moto-g-stylus-and-more">Cyber Monday Motorola deals<br></a>-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-black-friday-2024-deals">Cyber Monday Samsung deals</a><br>-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-oneplus-deals">Cyber Monday OnePlus deals</a></p></div></div>
<p>Obviously, a sub-$50 tablet is very enticing, especially if you're out shopping and they're conveniently placed right by the register. It might even work pretty well for a week or two, but it won't be long before you start noticing that it takes a year just to open an app. And you can forget about quickly switching back and forth between multiple apps.</p><p>Although it's definitely more difficult to find a good tablet for under $100, there are deals to be found. My favorite cheap tablet deal is for the Lenovo Tab M9, which i<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-tab-m9-9-tablet-32gb-arctic-grey/6536782.p?skuId=6536782">s on sale for almost 50% over at Best Buy</a>, coming in at $80. It's not anything spectacular, but you get a near-stock Android experience, a much better display, and even a microSD card slot.</p><p>Arguably, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/black-friday-chromebook-deals-2024-score-major-savings-on-acer-lenovo-samsung-and-more">Chromebook deals</a> can be even worse, as there are still countless listings for sub-$100 laptops that are barely worth the components within them. Many online retailers peddle these devices like they're the ice cream truck driving around the neighborhood. You get excited, spend a couple of bucks, and eat the ice cream, only to realize that it's freezer-burned and probably 10 years past its expiration date.</p><p>Look, I love ice cream as much as the next person, but just because I can get an ice cream bar for 90% off doesn't mean I'm going to fork over my money. This is the same kind of mindset that you should have when shopping, whether it be for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or because it's the fifth Sunday in April.</p>

<p>The first rule of thumb is to avoid any impulse purchases. I have a tendency to buy things when I'm feeling down, and that's usually when my dumbest purchases are made. Then, Amazon drops them off and I feel like an even bigger idiot because now I have to waste the gas to return whatever it is I bought.</p><p>In years past, I had a <em>really</em> bad tendency of buying something just because it was on sale. Even if it was something that I was already considering. But I didn't take the time to do some "window shopping," and just hit the big "BUY ME NOW" button.</p><p>Don't be like me. Do some research and check out more than just one retailer before making a final decision.</p><p>Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-shop-wisely-prime-day">broke down</a> how you shouldn't spend money just because there's a deal but because it's something you actually want to spend money on, and I wholeheartedly agree.</p>

<p>While shopping, you might have seen a deal or two on Amazon for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07XQQRCG5">Samsung Chromebook 4 Plus</a>, priced at $219 after a $100 discount. It uses the Intel Celeron N4000, has a 15.6-inch screen, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and all that jazz. Sounds good, right?</p><p>Well, how does this one sound? It has a 15.6-inch display, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. It is powered by the Intel Core i3-1215U and includes 12 months of Google AI. Oh, and you can save $120 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-chromebook-plus-515-laptop-with-google-ai-15-6-fhd-display-intel-i3-1215u-8gb-lpddr5x-128gb-ufs-wi-fi-6e-steel-gray/6551627.p?skuId=6551627">getting it for just $279</a>.</p><p>I just described the Acer Chromebook Plus 515, which is just over a year old. That's a mighty stark difference compared to the Samsung Chromebook 4, which landed on the scene all the way back in 2019.</p><p>Yes, I know and understand that not everyone can spare the extra $60 for the Acer. But that's just one example. There are a plethora of other deals that are actually worth anything and are not just a way for a retailer to get you to spend your money.</p>

<p>I don't mean for this to come off as condescending, but the truth is that there are plenty of people that get taken advantage of. It's happened to members of my own family, and in some instances, I've been able to get them to return whatever it was and help them find something that's worth the money. But there are other times when it's just too late, resulting in money being just flushed down the drain.</p>
<p>That being said, you shouldn't just avoid Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals and sales altogether. It's just important to do a bit of research first, making sure you really are getting the best bang for your buck. And if you need a bit of guidance or don't know which device to get, we've got your back.</p><p>Our team works tirelessly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-black-friday-2024-deals">find the best deals</a>, and that doesn't just mean finding the cheapest thing and writing about it. We research and source deals that make sense, even if the "deal" only saves you a few bucks compared to if it weren't on sale.

<p>After being fortunate enough to get some hands-on time with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus in New York, I couldn't wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">chance to review</a> it. I've been using it practically every day since it arrived on my doorstep, with the exception being when I've been testing out other devices.</p><p>The first thing that will draw you in is the design, which is something that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise if you've used Samsung devices in the past. It's sleek and premium, and the "Neptune Blue" looks simply incredible. Not to mention that this is the thinnest and lightest Chromebook Plus model on the market.</p>

<p>Walmart Plus members will get access to the Cyber Monday deals at 5pm EST on December 1st, hours before everyone else. There's also a ton of other benefits to a membership, such as free shipping and fuel discounts, so if you're interested, I'd recommend signing up to get 50% off your first year. There's also a free trial available, but you'll lose eligibility for this deal if you take that route. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/plus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9e5e2eba-e4b7-41cb-b0a4-7ee96e4a67a7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Walmart Plus: was $98" data-dimension48="Walmart Plus: was $98">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Walmart&apos;s Cyber Monday sale starts on Sunday, December 1st at 5pm EST for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/plus">Walmart Plus</a> members, while non-members will need to wait until 8pm EST to enjoy the savings. The discounts will continue until midnight EST on Monday, December 2nd. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-cyber-monday-2">When is Cyber Monday?</h2>
<p>Cyber Monday is traditionally the Monday after Black Friday. The event was first launched by retailers as an attempt to encourage customers to shop online. The plan apparently worked, as Cyber Monday is now considered to be one of the biggest sale events of the year. </p>
<h2 id="does-cyber-monday-have-better-deals-than-black-friday-2">Does Cyber Monday have better deals than Black Friday?</h2>
<p>Black Friday typically has better deals than Cyber Monday, but many retailers will extend their offerings (or launch entirely new deals) in preparation for the event. Cyber Monday is also known for being a great time to make smaller purchases in the wake of Black Friday. </p>

This is because I'm a big believer in having as much RAM and storage as possible and having 8GB versus 4GB of RAM will pay dividends in both the short, and long term.</p>

<p>Lenovo last refreshed its Chromebook Duet lineup back in 2022, and many of us were hoping that a new version was on the way. The company answered those prayers with the Chromebook Duet 11, refining it even further, and easily making one of the best Chromebooks out there.</p><p>With the Duet 11, you'll get a beautiful 11-inch display, with a resolution of 1920 x 1200, which is also capable of reaching up to 400 nits of brightness. Sandwiched between the glass and aluminum is the MediaTek Kompanio 838, which does a fantastic job at being both performant and efficient.</p><p>There's a lot of competition in the space, but part of what has helped the Chromebook Duet stand out is that it includes a detachable keyboard. Much like the tablet, the keyboard cover has also been refined, making for an excellent typing experience.</p><p>On top of all of that, the Duet 11 supports USI 2.0, and as a bonus, Lenovo is including its USI Pen 2 in the box which would set you back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/stylus-pens-and-supplies/pens/4x81q72383">another $45</a>! So when this lands on your doorstep, you'll have everything you need to start using it, without needing to pay more by ordering other accessories.</p>

Seriously, we've seen a lot of crazy Black Friday and Cyber Monday Chromebook deals, but being able to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1400CKA-AS88F/dp/B0CRTJ1LZ4/"><strong>ASUS Chromebook CX1 for $100 off</strong></a> might just be the craziest of them all.</p><p>At first glance, saving $100 on a Chromebook probably seems as though it's "par for the course," and you'd be right. But when you consider that the Chromebook CX1 is already one of the best cheap Chromebooks for under $250, that extra $100 is a big deal (pun intended.)</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9d83f40a-835d-4d2c-8f8b-79d8a68d685c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension48="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension25="$109.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1400CKA-AS88F/dp/B0CRTJ1LZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="AuKKcUZe2DY5kDgo2bYdTk" name="asus-chromebook-cx1-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AuKKcUZe2DY5kDgo2bYdTk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There are cheap Chromebooks, and then there are cheap Chromebooks that are good. The ASUS Chromebook CX1 falls into the latter category, and thanks to Amazon's early Cyber Monday deals, you can save $100.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-Chromebook-CX1-14-inch-FHD-Laptop-Intel-Celeron-N4500-4GB-RAM-128GB-eMMC-Silver/6717057798" data-dimension112="9d83f40a-835d-4d2c-8f8b-79d8a68d685c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension48="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension25="$109.99">$159 at Walmart </a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1400CKA-AS88F/dp/B0CRTJ1LZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9d83f40a-835d-4d2c-8f8b-79d8a68d685c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension48="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension25="$109.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>For the unaware, there are actually two versions of the Chromebook CX1, the CX1 (CX1400) and the CX1 (CX1500). The only difference between the two is the screen size, as the CX1400 features a 14-inch display, and the CX1500 adds an inch.</p><p>While both of these are actually on sale as part of Amazon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/black-friday-chromebook-deals-2024-score-major-savings-on-acer-lenovo-samsung-and-more">early Cyber Monday Chromebook deals</a>, we're particularly fond of the CX1400. The smaller display makes for a smaller and lighter Chromebook, which is rather important if you're carrying this around in a bag with you all day. For many, a compact Chromebook wins out more often than not, giving ASUS Chromebook CX1 (CX1400) the nod for us.</p><p>Under the hood, we have the tried and true Intel Celeron N4500 paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. Obviously, this won't win any performance awards, but the N4500 offers enough "oomph" to handle a bit of multitasking. Really, it's the perfect Chromebook for things like writing up and reviewing documents or responding to emails.</p><p>Something else that you'll love is having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> that will last you all day, and then some. Thanks to the lower-end specs, the Chromebook CX1 just sips on battery and is rated to last for up to 12 hours on a single charge. So you can respond to those emails, close the lid for the night, and pick right back up the next morning without worrying about running out of juice.</p><p>As I mentioned before, the 15-inch model is also on sale, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1500CKA-AS84F/dp/B0CRD43GY6"><strong>Amazon currently listing it for $169, a savings of $80</strong></a>. So while it's not as cheap as its smaller counterpart, you're still getting a great deal.</p>
