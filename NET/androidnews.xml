                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It seems that it&apos;s becoming more common for companies making tech products to promise a future update that enables a key feature. It&apos;s really not, but it feels that way because the wait times keep getting longer, and the prices of the gadgets keep growing. This makes us notice it more and more.</p><p>You can&apos;t single out any one company for doing it, either. We&apos;ve seen it from Google, Samsung, Apple, and all the smaller players in tech time and time again. While I can&apos;t say with authority why companies do this, I can guess: they want to entice you to buy the thing they are showing you. Letting you know what it may be able to do one day is being used as a selling point.</p>
<p>What we can do is take a look at why it might take extra time to get features working. Nobody wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-delays-galaxy-buds-3-pro-shipments">hold up the release of a product</a> because one thing isn&apos;t ready and none of us would be happy about waiting for the thing we want next. Doing that would push people to buy a competing product and no tech company wants that.Â </p>

<p>There are a couple of good reasons why it may take extra time to enable a feature. I think the biggest issue is also one that&apos;s unsolvable for even tech giants like Samsung or Apple: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/why-net-neutrality-is-so-important">government regulation</a>.</p><p>If a feature uses new technology or has a chance of interfering with existing tech, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-is-fcc-certification-necessary">right government bodies</a> for each country need to evaluate it and approve it. This is a good thing because products all have to work together on the same "infrastructure." Signals need to coexist and we can&apos;t have one device causing trouble for others. The only way to ensure that is by having a strict set of rules that everyone has to follow and an agency that tests and certifies that products adhere to these rules.</p>

<p>This all goes double when it comes to healthcare. Anything used to diagnose, evaluate, or treat fitness and health issues must be both safe and accurate, or at least accurate enough to not be harmful. Nobody wants a health-tracking device that gives bad information, even if all these products come with a disclaimer that they aren&apos;t to be trusted. Miscounting your steps is merely inconvenient; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/earbud-heart-rate-accuracy-test">misdiagnosing your heart rhythm</a> could be much more serious. We saw the holdup of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-pro-body-temperature-sensor">working temperature sensor</a> inside the Pixel 8 Pro because of this.</p>
<p>Another issue that crops up often is a legal one: patent infringement or disputes. We just saw this in action with the new Apple Watch; devices sold in the United States can&apos;t measure blood oxygen because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255434500?sortBy=rank">a dispute between Apple and Masimo</a>, a company that builds medical-grade oxygen sensors. When this dispute is settled, Apple can send a software update that enables it, but until then, it will not work.</p>
<p>Other reasons are valid but harder to accept. Google promised an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lesson-learned-with-google-zoom-enhance-feature">enhanced zoom feature using AI</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but we had to wait for the release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> a year later to see it. Google knew what it wanted to do and knew the Pixel 8 Pro hardware was capable, but it didn&apos;t know when it would be ready. It still told us about this future feature, though.</p><p>This happens a lot. Companies have grand plans and are certain they can make something happen, but it takes longer than anticipated. Sometimes it never happens at all.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not saying companies need to stop doing this or telling you to stop buying products based on what they might do one day. Those decisions are not mine to make. I&apos;m saying why it might happen and each of us should decide how much blame we should lay at the feet of the company making the promises. I really don&apos;t think a few small features should hold up the release of any device.</p><p>Myself? I only spend money based of what a product can do <em>right now</em>. If I get any future capability I consider it a bonus, not keeping a promise.</p>

<hr>
<p>The wait for Samsung&apos;s One UI 7 continues as users are given a dreary update on the state of its development.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1833467943125991880">Tarun Vats</a>, users have taken to the Samsung Community forums with questions about the first One UI 7 beta, but a team member suggests it&apos;s still in the works (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/wait-samsungs-one-ui-7-beta-keeps-getting-longer/">Android Police</a>). The post states delays have continued due to Samsung holding ongoing "discussions" regarding new features for the Android 15-based software.</p><p>The beta team member adds that the company wants to stabilize the software <em>before </em>eager testers can begin downloading it.</p><p>One UI 7 is expected to be quite a substantial OS upgrade for Galaxy devices. The community post didn&apos;t detail a potential timeline for when users could expect to enroll in the beta.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1833469432502304886">the tipster claims</a> on X that the beta could begin and end in October, indicating that Samsung could fast-track One UI 7. Nothing is set in stone as things can change between now and October (and beyond).</p><p>Android Central has reached out about this continued delay of the first One UI 7 beta. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">rumored earlier</a> this year that Samsung started internally testing One UI 7; however, reports soon after changed the tune. In June, rumors claimed that Samsung was delaying the launch of One UI 7 due <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delay-one-ui-6-1-1-ai">to the AI overhaul</a> its One UI 6.1.1 update would bring Galaxy devices.</p><p>The next iteration of One UI was expected to begin its beta in August, though the development of the 6.1.1 update (reportedly) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">stopped it</a>. Outside of new features, tipsters have stated that Samsung has continuously grappled with stability issues with One UI 7.</p><p>The next major OS will supposedly bring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">drastically different UI</a> experience, that could remind you of Apple&apos;s iOS. Reminiscent of iOS 18, One UI 7 could deliver rounded corner notifications, a revamped quick settings menu, and (potentially) Samsung&apos;s take on Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dynamic-island-android-hole-punch-cameras-overhaul">Dynamic Island</a>.</p><p>While it seems we&apos;re still in for a lengthy One UI 7 delay, users are just getting their hands on One UI 6.1.1. Samsung started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">rolling the update out</a> to the Galaxy S24 series alongside the September 2024 patch last week. The company then revealed during IFA 2024 that the Galaxy S23 series, Flip 5, Fold 5, and the Tab S9 series will also receive the latest Galaxy AI features and enhancements.</p>

<p>OnePlus is one of the few OEM makers that brings the latest and greatest Snapdragon chip-powered flagship phone almost every year. This time appears no different, as the OnePlus 13, with the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, has already hit the Geekbench test, revealing what to expect.</p><p>The device hitting the Geekbench test was shared by tipster Ice Universe on X. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> bearing the <strong>OnePlus PJZ110</strong> model number is seen scoring 3236 single-core scores accompanied by 10049 multi-core scores.

<p>The Geekbench 6 test screenshot further reveals that the device is running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box. While these scores indicate that OnePlus is developing a solid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, they also corroborate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">earlier benchmark leak</a> of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset, revealing impressive single- and multi-core scores.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-making-its-debut-way-sooner-than-expected">Recent developments</a> have indicated that the OnePlus 13 is coming earlier than usual. It could be as early as next month in China, and it could be in line with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 announcement, which is slated to happen in Hawaii at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-summit">Snapdragon Summit</a> scheduled for October 21-23.</p><p>The chipset is also notable for Qualcomm as it will be the first processor to incorporate the new Oryon CPU cores, the same ones that powered the Snapdragon X PC SoCs earlier.</p>
<p>Aside from the October release, the OnePlus 13 is expected to bump up the cameras by incorporating three 50MP sensors next to a 3x optical zoom, all powered by the popular Hassebled incorporation as seen on the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. It is also rumored to equip a giant 6000mAh battery capacity with support for 50W wireless charging and 100W fast wired charging.</p><p>The latest leaked benchmark only points out that the company is testing the device already for the anticipated early launch. Xiaomi was also one of the early adopters of the flagship Qualcomm chipset, and this time, OnePlus appears to be joining the bandwagon earlier.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s AI-backed notetaking app is getting a nifty upgrade for those who aren&apos;t interested in reading lengthy pieces of text.</p><p>Following a major Gemini upgrade earlier this summer, Google detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">Keyword post</a> that NotebookLM is rolling out "Audio Overviews." The company advises users that this feature is experimental and has limitations, such as long loading times for extensive notebooks.</p><p>Regardless, users can hop into NotebookLM > <strong>open a pre-existing journal > open the Notebook guide > hit "generate."</strong></p><p>After generating, Google states users will be in the company of <em>two </em>AI hosts for your research "discussion." The AI can summarize the provided material, "make connections" between subjects, and simulate banter. The post states users can add documents, slides, charts, "and more" into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a> and generate an Audio Overview.</p><p>Users can then download their generated Audio Overview to take with them and listen on the go. Additionally, the audio log will have its own space within the Notebook guide alongside options to ask additional questions, create files, and more.</p><p>Despite Google saying the AI can create a "deep dive" into any topic you&apos;re interested in, it adds that the discussion isn&apos;t "comprehensive." The AI hosts are also prone to some inaccuracies, such as pronouncing words.</p>

<p>NotebookLM saw a limited launch during the summer of 2023 before rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-us-launch-new-features">to the public in the U.S.</a> last December. That debut saw the company fuel it with its Gemini Pro model to help the software in "multiple ways." That update also lets users save their interactions with NotebookLM, which also saves relevant citations for later use.</p><p>However, Google reiterated that the AI-based notebook expanded globally this summer alongside its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">1.5 Flash upgrade</a>. Gemini&apos;s Flash model is stated to be lighter and faster with better efficiency than the 1.5 Pro variant. Google states 1.5 Flash can take in large chunks of data with the processing speeds to back up the name. Its existence in NotebookLM will most likely aid in summarization, data extraction, and table creation.</p><p>Those are all things Google touts its 1.5 Flash model as being "proficient" in.</p><p>Either way, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-notebooklm-limited-launch">just getting into NotebookLM</a> should still fact-check what the AI helper delivers. Even though the AI recites information in a condensed form, Google still provides citations. Users should take advantage of this as the company states the AI is prone to hallucinating certain facts.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy S24 FE might cost around $100 more than the S23 FE, potentially hitting $699 in the U.S.</li><li>However, the base model will still have 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, even with the price increase.</li><li>The camera setup remains the same, but the S24 FE will have a bigger battery for longer use.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has been making waves, as Fan Edition phones usually bring flagship features at a lower price. But a new rumor suggests this year&apos;s model might not be as budget-friendly.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,145122.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a>, the Galaxy S24 FE could see a price jump of around â¬100 in Europe compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>. If this carries over to the U.S., we&apos;re looking at a $100 bump, bringing the price to about $699. Thatâs a step up from the S23 FEâs starting price of $599.</p><p>Samsung isn&apos;t expected to offer more RAM or storage with the higher priceâthe base model still supposedly comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. However, the Galaxy S24 FE is expected to get some key upgrades that could make the price hike worth it.</p><p>First off, the Galaxy S24 FE is set to sport a 6.7-inch display, a nice upgrade from the S23 FEâs 6.4-inch screen. This upgrade marks a major shift in screen size for Samsung&apos;s Fan Edition lineup.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE is likely to draw its power from a 4nm Exynos 2400e chipset, a slightly toned-down version of the Exynos 2400 used in the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. This move taps into the efficiency and performance improvements of the Exynos 2400 over the previous Exynos 2200, potentially giving the S24 FE a welcome performance boost.</p><p>On the optics side of things, the S24 FE will likely keep the same camera setup as its predecessor, including a 50MP main lens, a 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP 3x telephoto.</p><p>While the camera specs are familiar, the new model is expected to come with a bigger battery, thanks to its larger body, which could mean longer usage times.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-fe-fcc-certification-listing-launch-rumors">expected to stick with the same 25W charging speed</a> as its predecessor, keeping things consistent with the previous model.</p>

<ul><li>A massive batch of leaked information regarding the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra might've left nothing for Samsung to tease.</li><li>The Ultra model is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display with an S Pen, a 13MP primary lens, and an 8MP ultrawide lens on its back panel.</li><li>Rumors claim the devices will retain the same battery capacities as the Tab S9 series and they may hit the shelves in "Moonstone Gray" and "Platinum Silver."</li><li>The tablets may launch in October alongside the Galaxy S24 FE.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We might be on the cusp of Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy Tab release, but the latest round of leaks might tell us all we need to know.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-plus-images-specs.html">Android Headlines</a> begins with the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, stating the device could have a 14.6-inch display. Rumors claim it will be an AMOLED 2X "anti-reflection" screen; however, its proposed refresh rate is unknown. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a> offers a Super AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, so perhaps we&apos;re in for an upgrade.</p><p>Speaking of the past, the Tab S10 Ultra is still rumored to feature a design similar to its predecessor. The leaked imagery suggests it will retain that notch at the top-middle of its display, housing the selfie lens. Moreover, the publication claims that the upcoming iteration will sport "thinner bezels."</p><p>It&apos;s hard to discern the truth through the renderings, meaning we&apos;ll have to wait once it&apos;s in hand.</p><p>Speculation states the Tab S10 Ultra will debut with a 13MP primary camera and an 8MP ultrawide lens for its dual array. It&apos;s suspected that the front will continue Samsung&apos;s trend of dual-12MP lenses (wide-angle and ultrawide) like last year.</p><p>The tablet is rumored to deliver up to 16GB of RAM and a maximum of 1TB of storage. Rumors suggest consumers can "expand" the device&apos;s storage. The Tab S9 Ultra could do that, too, so long as you had a microSD card handy. Additionally, an 11,200mAh battery could greet consumers, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-s10-ultra-charging-speed-leak">we&apos;re unlikely to see a change</a> in this department.</p><p>Consumers may find the tablet available in "Moonstone Gray" and "Platinum Silver" colorways.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the leaks dive into the Tab S10 Plus, which might launch with a smaller 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X "anti-reflection" screen. This tablet&apos;s battery is supposedly hitting the market with a 10,090mAh capacity like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">the S9 variant</a>. The similarities continue as the report states users may see up to 512GB of storage and only 12GB RAM.</p><p>Similar to the proposed Ultra model, the Tab S10 Plus seemingly sticks close to the S9&apos;s design. Additionally, rumors purport that the cameras on the S10 Plus will remain similar to the Ultra option. The difference lies in the selfie camera, which is reportedly a singular lens at 12MP.</p><p>Speculation claims the Plus and Ultra will receive an IP68 rating for dust and water and share the same color choices.</p><p>There&apos;s little doubt that the Galaxy Tab S10 duo will arrive <em>without </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, especially following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">a recent leaked image</a> of its transcription capabilities. The current leaks haul in even more information, suggesting the tablets will be capable of Circle to Search, Note Assist, Drawing Assist, Photo Assist, Interpreter, Live Translate, and Chat Assist.</p><p>Another rumor from last week theorizes that Samsung could upgrade the keyboard accessories for its next series with a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-galaxy-ai-key-keyboard-rumor">Galaxy AI key</a>." With One UI 6.1.1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">finally hitting devices</a>, the rumored AI features alongside this quick AI shortcut seem plausible. Â It&apos;s currently unknown how this AI key would work and if users can customize which features they&apos;d like to surface when pressed.</p>

<ul><li>Google's fight against the EU's proposed ~$2.8 billion fine against it for antitrust practices has ended following arguments with the region's highest court.</li><li>The EU's investigations showed that Google conducted antitrust practices with its comparison shopping services in 2017.</li><li>Google is currently wrapped in two other antitrust investigations: one for the AdTech space and another regarding the U.S. DOJ.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A long-standing antitrust case between Google and the EU has come to an unsavory conclusion for the former.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-court-upholds-googles-27-bln-eu-antitrust-fine-2024-09-10/">Reuters</a>, the European Union&apos;s 2.4 billion euro (~$2.8 billion) antitrust fine against Google will stand. This case between the two parties stretches back to 2017 when the EU deemed Google guilty of abusing its dominance in the search industry by pushing its comparison shopping service above the competition.</p><p>The publication cites a CJEU judge standing firm on the matter stating, "in particular, the conduct of undertakings in a dominant position that has the effect of hindering competition on the merits and is thus likely to cause harm to individual undertakings and consumers is prohibited."</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time Google has tried to appeal this major antitrust lawsuit against their practices in the realm of shopping. Though things began in 2017, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-loses-appeal-against-eu24-billion-eu-antitrust-fine">appealed the ruling in 2021</a> and Europe&apos;s second-highest court promptly dismissed its attempt. The court reiterated at the time that Google favored its comparison shopping service and put itself in a more favorable position amongst consumers.</p><p>That initial appeal three years ago saw the court confirm "the amount of the penalty and rejected Google&apos;s arguments that no penalty should have been imposed on it."</p><p>All that was left was for Google to take its arguments to Europe&apos;s highest court. We&apos;ve already seen the outcome of that today as the EU will stand with its antitrust fine, causing Google to lose once more.</p><p>Tough times continue as Google has two more ongoing legal battles: its dominant position in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-statement-objections-google-ad-business">the AdTech space</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">recent DOJ ruling</a> in the U.S. Regarding the former, Google was accused of making its AdX ad exchange platform stand higher above the competition in 2023. The European Commission found that the company made it "difficult" for its competitors to compete with it due to the process behind the ad exchange process.</p><p>If guilty, Google would violate Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</p><p>In the U.S., the Department of Justice is still deciding whether or not to break up Google following its illegal monopoly ruling. The DOJ has considered forcing Google to break up, which would see the company divest Android and Chrome. Alternatively, Google could be forced to share more data with the competition.</p>

<p>Apple took to the stage on September 9, 2024, for its annual iPhone show, debuting the iPhone 16 series. While the dedicated camera button took center stage, another feature didn&apos;t get much attention, and for good reason. The display on both the $800 iPhone 16 and $900 iPhone 16 Plus is still the same tired old 60Hz OLED that Apple has been fleecing customers with for years.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">best Android phone under $300</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>, sells for just $200âwith a $289 RAM and storage upgrade optionâand sports a 120Hz LTPS OLED panel. That means its display can run at a buttery smooth 120Hz and drop down lower than that to save battery when needed. A 120Hz display makes even cheap phones feel fast, and similarly, a 60Hz display makes even the fastest phones feel sluggish and ancient.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/greengart/status/1833216951818088877">hands-on photos</a> show that Apple has done nothing to improve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate of its phones, once again leaving them at a slow 480Hz flicker rate. The CMF Phone 1 utilizes a much more eye-friendly, flicker-free dimming method above 18% brightness, then switches to 960Hz PWM dimming below that. In other words, if you&apos;re worried about eye health or sensitive to flickering lights or displays, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Phone-256GB-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7ZT1XDC/">saving over $500</a> on a CMF Phone 1 is the smart buy.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 even sports the same 2,000 nits peak brightness level as the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, so it&apos;s nice and easy to see outside.</p>

<p>Looking back at history, seeing Apple lag behind with display specs isn&apos;t a big surprise. The company&apos;s first phone with an OLED panel, the iPhone X, launched seven years after Android phones began adopting OLED. Similarly, the first Android phone with a 120Hz display, the Razer Phone, launched in 2017, while it took until the iPhone 13 in 2021 for Apple to follow suit with its first 120Hz phones.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Apple has long lagged behind Android phones in display quality, often taking years to adopt new and better features.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Since then, Apple has kept 120Hz as a "pro-level" spec, which is reserved for its most expensive phones. In other words, if you want a display that&apos;s at least partly up to spec with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">$200 Android phones</a>, you&apos;ll need to spend at least $1,000 to get it on the iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>On the flagship level, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> comes in at around the same size as the iPhone 16 with the same price tagâthat&apos;s $799âand sports a 120Hz LTPO display that can go from 60Hz to 120Hz dynamically. It also comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> and a host of truly interesting AI tricks up its sleeve like the amazing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> that gets <em>everyone</em> in the group photo.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The one area where Apple continues to excel is processing speed, and the comparison isn't even close.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The obvious advantage Apple has over any Android phone on this list is the A18 processor, which is more powerful than most Android chips. However, we don&apos;t yet have benchmarks for direct comparisons. We do know that Apple claims a 15% improvement in AI processing, which will set it apart significantly in this area.</p><p>For reference, the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> in most Android flagships is the slowest in AI-based processing tasks based on Geekbench AI scores, with scores of 485, 485, and 1117 in each of the three test results. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> inside the Google Pixel 9 lags behind in the first test with a score of 289 but handily beats the Snapdragon in the next two tests with scores of 4145 and 6103, respectively.</p><p>Apple&apos;s older A17 Pro chip boasts scores of 3878, 21324, and 26213. No, those aren&apos;t typos, and the A18 is supposed to be even faster than that. If we&apos;re playing an AI processing race, Apple wins handily.</p><p>However, Apple doesn&apos;t seem to be using all this extra processing power to do anything truly new, particularly with the display. The company is launching a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a>-like feature on the iPhone 16 series, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">Android users have been enjoying these same features since 2017</a>. Likewise, even camera features like computational processing were pioneered by companies like Google and have been staples of Pixel and Nexus phones for over a decade.</p>

Apple isn&apos;t one to introduce drastic hardware changes year-on-year; what it does better is roll out unique features that actually make a difference.</p>

<p>This year, that honor belongs to Camera Control, a button that&apos;s located on the lower right corner. The button is available on all iPhone 16 models â including the standard variants â and that&apos;s good to see. As the name suggests, Camera Control is a dedicated button that lets you launch the camera, take photos and videos, and adjust modes â all without having to interact with the viewfinder.</p><p>It is essentially a capacitive button with a haptic motor that delivers feedback, and it is pressure sensitive. The best part is the versatility it offers: a short press launches the camera, and once you&apos;re in the viewfinder, another short press takes a photo, and a long press starts recording video.</p><p>My favorite feature is the ability to adjust the zoom level just by swiping on the button; I constantly fiddle with the lenses on my phones, so that&apos;s bound to come in handy. Of course, the ability to launch the camera and take photos or videos with a button isn&apos;t new on Android â most phones have that feature baked into the power button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5vjcmznuRpFAsDURgDdvC6" name="asus-zenfone-10-review-21.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vjcmznuRpFAsDURgDdvC6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, ASUS offered a similar feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">Zenfone 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a>, integrating a capacitive module into the power key that had decent customizability. The ZenTouch key allowed you to pull down the notification pane to view notifications, scroll through websites, and even adjust media playback. It was one of the best features on previous Zenfone devices, and I&apos;m annoyed that ASUS didn&apos;t retain it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> this year.</p><p>That said, I want to see a similar button make its way to more Android phones. It isn&apos;t unreasonable to think that might be the case; Android brands love borrowing features from the iPhone, as evidenced from the half-baked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oxygenos-14-dynamic-island-ui-clone">Dynamic Island clones</a> you get with ColorOS. A hardware button to control the camera has greater potential on Android â particularly on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> and Vivo X100 Ultra, which have outstanding cameras.</p>

<p>While Xiaomi doesn&apos;t offer any extra buttons on the 14 Ultra, it sells a Photography Kit that&apos;s fantastic; it includes a case, a photography grip that attaches to the device, and it has a 1500mAh battery. The attachment brings a traditional shutter button, record button, an adjustable dial, and zoom controls, and it utterly transforms the 14 Ultra, making it easier to hold the phone and take photos and videos.</p><p>Using the accessory with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra made me realize that there&apos;s a definite need to have physical camera controls, and if it can be achieved by offering something like Camera Control, then manufacturers need to start doing so on Android. Chinese brands in particular have pushed the boundaries of imaging tech over the last two years, and hardware buttons to make the cameras easier to control would go a long way â at least in my own use case.</p>

<p>As Samsung is almost done with the major phone launches this year, the Fan Edition phone of the flagship series is yet to see the light of day. While we await the launch, a new leak reveals the device&apos;s design and some interesting specs.</p><p>You can see the full gallery of images over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-colors-renders-images.html">Android Headlines</a>, which has shared images of the upcoming Galaxy S24 FE color options, revealing the device in Blue, Graphite, Green, and Yellow. Per the renders, the upcoming mid-range phone from Samsung can also be seen from all angles, revealing an interesting flat design similar to the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, as opposed to the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, which featured slightly rounded corners and edges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="UeFPKLTfKuBBWJ8V9RboxB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-FE-leaked-render-colors.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 FE in four colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UeFPKLTfKuBBWJ8V9RboxB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new design appears to be a welcome change, and the colors look promising, too. Graphite looks interesting over regular black, while blue and green look more conventional. Yellow seems to be a new addition to the Galaxy S24 FE, and Samsung recently introduced theÂ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>Â in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-now-comes-titanium-yellow">Yellow Titanium</a> shade as well.</p><p>The publication showcased five colors, but the Silver option appears missing. However, theÂ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-images-leak">earlier leak</a>Â (as shown in the featured image) also showcased the device&apos;s colorways. Samsung is likely toÂ have the device ready in five color options when it launches.</p>

<p>Aside from the colors, both sides of the device will have a glass back. It will have a flat display with a punch hole cut out and thinner bezels measuring 1.99mm. The display will likely be 6.7 inches with Full HD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is expected to be up to 1900 nits and will be offered with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection.</p><p>Some of the specs were leaked earlier through marketing images. The device sports three rear cameras: a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and an 8MP telephoto sensor.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S24 FE bearing the SM-S721U model number has reached the Wireless Power Consortium website, according to tipster Abhishek Yadav. This comes after the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-fe-fcc-certification-listing-launch-rumors">FCC certification</a>. The WPC not only confirmed the device&apos;s wireless and wired charging speeds but also confirmed its design. Per the certification, the device will have 15W wireless charging speed and 25W wired charging speed, which is still slow compared to the 2024&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a>, which feature ultra-fast charging speeds.</p><p>As for the launch, the Galaxy S24 FE is expected to unwrap in the coming weeks or months. For comparison, the predecessor came in the first week of October 2023.</p>
