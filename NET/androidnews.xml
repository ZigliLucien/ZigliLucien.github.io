<ul><li>A new wave of rumors suggests Samsung could deliver a third Galaxy Watch 7 later this year during Unpacked.</li><li>The second rumor doubles down on past speculation, which stated the Galaxy Watch 7 could utilize the 3nm process-based Exynos W940.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 series was previously rumored to have an "Ultra" model in the works, which could arrive in addition to or in replacement of its Pro model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims Samsung could release a third variant for its Galaxy Watch 7 later in 2024.</p><p>According to X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/kro_roe/status/1768266399821262981">Kro_Roe</a>, the Korean OEM is allegedly planning on launching a Galaxy Watch 7 Classic, Watch 7 Pro, and an unnamed third addition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/15/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-chip-three-variants-rumors/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster states the extra variant will be a "new one" in the machine-translated post, though nothing further was purported.</p><p>Another rumor states Samsung could provide a meaningful power boost to the Watch 7 series with a chipset upgrade.</p><p>Rumors stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1768414829004378195">TheGalox</a> on X, which states the Watch 7 could utilize Samsung&apos;s new Exynos W940 chip. They add the chip may offer a 50% boost in power efficiency alongside a potential 30% increase in speed.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exynos W940, the processor powering the Galaxy Watch7 series, will apparently be 50% more efficient and 30% faster than the previous model pic.twitter.com/XUFAe0c8ZA<a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1768414829004378195">March 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As far as the rumored third variant goes, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">rumored back in October</a> that Samsung could be developing a Watch 7 "Ultra." An Ultra model was speculated to arrive in addition to or in replacement of a Watch 7 Pro.</p><p>It was also stated that such a device could feature a MicroLED display. That display would provide a richer color experience, including better contrast, brightness, and energy efficiency compared to other LED products.</p><p>Meanwhile, this rumored Exynos W940 chip from Samsung was rumored last October, as well, suggesting it would be built on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-rumored-to-receive-3nm-exynos-chip">a 3nm process</a> instead of a 5nm. In addition to where the W940 could improve, it was previously stated the new chip could reduce its area by 35%. Consumers could be in for a slightly slimmer Galaxy Watch 7 if the rumors are true.</p><p>We&apos;re likely only a few months out from an official Watch 7 series reveal as Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">could take place</a> on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a new custom camera UI for Messages today (Mar. 15) that offers a streamlined, convenient approach for users.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/14/google-messages-new-camera/">9to5Google</a>, Messages&apos; new camera UI will reportedly replace your Android phone&apos;s default viewfinder. The new UI is also built off "Compose" and lets users pinch to zoom in or tap the three default zoom strengths above the shutter button.</p><p>Google is finally letting users switch between snapping photos and recording videos. Messages&apos; new UI features those options at the bottom, which should give users peace of mind, as they won&apos;t need to <em>launch </em>Messages&apos; camera in one mode or the other.</p>

<p>While the app&apos;s new viewfinder offers a bit of convenience, Google has seemingly removed an array of camera tools. The app&apos;s cog wheel, which expanded on your camera settings, is no longer present in this UI redesign. For some devices, tapping on this cogwheel lets you tinker with your camera flash, set a timer, or even alter your camera&apos;s aspect ratio.</p><p>For other devices, tapping the icon would open the system&apos;s default settings for its camera. Additionally, the redesigned viewfinder drops the grid overlay.</p><p>The publication speculates that this revamped UI could allow Google to pop in more features down the road. For now, Google Messages&apos; new camera UI is rolling out today (Mar. 15) as a server-side update. We haven&apos;t seen it appear just yet, meaning it&apos;s still making its rounds.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest camera rework in its messaging app comes two days after the company rolled out new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-messages-gets-new-emoji-reaction-effects">emoji reaction effects</a>. The effects are available for SMS and RCS chats and allow users to experience new animations when reacting to texts. The "dynamic twist" users will find only support a selection of 10 emojis. It&apos;s unclear if Google will add more to that list.</p>

<ul><li>Code inside Google's Drive app on Android shows that it's working on bringing a new "category" system to users.</li><li>Users will be able to customize and display their important categories on Drive's "home" tab for easy discovery.</li><li>The code also showed users that they could select which categories a stored Drive file or document should contain in its three-dot menu.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It appears that Google is working on bringing a new category system to Drive that should make it easier for users to find what they&apos;re looking for.</p><p>The feature was discovered by AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Google-Drive-File-Categories.html">TheSpAndroid</a>), and the post states that "Categories" will appear on the Drive app&apos;s home tab (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-drive-organization-files-storage/">Android Police</a>). Users may soon find their categories as rounded icons in a row at the top of the app&apos;s welcoming page. Moreover, a three-dot menu is said to let users "Manage Categories" for customization purposes.</p><p>In the app&apos;s code, tapping this option will let users decide which categories should appear quickly at the top.Â </p><p>Another finding shows that users can decide which "category" their documents and files should fall under. The app&apos;s code shows that tapping the three-dot menu on a document will soon include a second "Manage categories" option.

<p>While the discovery was made in the Android app&apos;s code, AssembleDeBug states the feature will arrive on the web and iOS devices. Additionally, they speculate that personal and Workspace accounts should pick up categories whenever Google is finished.</p><p>While we await this new categorization method, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-video-playback-speed-boost">recently rolled out</a> an update to Drive that improves the playback experience of uploaded videos. The company&apos;s solution, which it calls "DASH," works to adjust the quality of your stored content depending on your network&apos;s speed. Google also detailed a refined search experience, which has only rolled out for iOS devices thus far.</p><p>New filters like File Type,Â Owner, andÂ Last Modified should be available on Android, but Google has not said when.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Finding a cheap fitness tracker with reliable accuracy and all the key features you need is a challenge. On paper, the Garmin Forerunner 165 looks like a solid option that costs hundreds less than most Garmin watches. So after receiving my review unit, I set out to see how it compares against my two favorite cheap fitness trackers: The COROS PACE 3 and Fitbit Charge 6.</p><p>First, I walked 5,000 steps and ran 1,000 steps wearing all three devices, while counting my steps with a manual pedometer. Then I ran five miles to test their GPS accuracy, while also wearing a Polar H10 chest strap to judge their heart rate accuracy. Lastly, I finished off with a sprint workout on a local track to double-check GPS and heart rate accuracy in more vigorous conditions.Â </p><p>Here are the results, comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-delivers-absurd-value-for-frugal-serious-runners">Garmin Forerunner 165</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> for accuracy!</p>
<h2 id="step-accuracy-2">Step accuracy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-step-test-with-Fitbit-Charge-6-and-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer held in hand with the number 5,000, a Garmin Forerunner 165 (5,062 steps), and a Fitbit Charge 6 (4,812 steps)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I did my original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">step-tracking accuracy test</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> beat the other brands, with the flagship COROS watch coming in third and the Fitbit Sense coming in last for accuracy. But I wasn&apos;t sure if Garmin&apos;s advantage would persist with a watch model that costs $200 less.Â </p><p>I wrote down the incidental steps for all three watches outside my front door, then tracked 5,000 steps of walking while counting every step with a pedometer. I then ran another 1,000 steps while counting, to see if the accuracy changed. After that, I stopped tracking each step, but I still wrote down my final step count for each fitness tracker, to see how far apart they were.Â </p>

<p>Interestingly, my results mirrored my last test: Garmin did exceptionally well at avoiding false-positive steps at just 11 over estimate, compared to 14 last time. COROS over-estimated my count my 84, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">APEX 2 Pro</a> was 70 steps off. And once again, Fitbit significantly undercounted my steps: 199 off this time, 284 off last time.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="U4MdV6vQFG9cmcSetZ2xGK" name="COROS-PACE-3-step-test-with-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer showing "6,000" and a COROS PACE 3 worn on a wrist with the step count 6,102." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4MdV6vQFG9cmcSetZ2xGK.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While tracking running, Fitbit and COROS did much better, which makes sense because the accelerometer can detect larger motions more easily. Garmin still won for accuracy, though it did better on average for walking.Â </p><p>I can&apos;t tell you my actual step count for the day, but I&apos;m inclined to believe that Garmin&apos;s number remained the most accurate. If we assume that, then COROS&apos; count (143 short) is within a reasonable margin of error for such a long distance, whereas Fitbit (794 short) is less forgiveably erroneous.Â </p>
<h2 id="heart-rate-accuracy-2">Heart rate accuracy</h2>
<p>I wore the Polar H10 chest strap, one of the most popular and respected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-heart-rate-monitor-straps-garmin-fitbit">heart rate monitors</a> out there, to see how the Garmin Forerunner 165 compared to it in accuracy and responsiveness.Â </p><p>For my first five-mile run, only the Forerunner 165 matched the Polar H10 for average heart rate at 158 bpm, while the Fitbit Charge 6 and COROS PACE 3 came close at 157 bpm. The same goes for minimum heart rate, with Garmin and Polar showing 96 bpm while COROS and Fitbit listed 95 bpm. As for the maximum, both Garmin and COROS registered a max heart rate of 176, while Polar only hit 175 and Fitbit topped at 174.Â </p>

<p>The heart rate chart above shows how the Garmin Forerunner 165 and Polar H10 compare directly. As with any wrist-based optical HRM, the Forerunner 165 lags slightly behind the chest strap, climbing at a slower pace and keeping the same heart rate readings after the H10 has already begun to dip back down.Â </p><p>For the most part, the Forerunner 165 remained within 1â2 bpm of the chest strap at all times, and usually corrected itself fairly quickly. It explains why they ended up with the same average, despite the differences. That said, it did seem to struggle a bit in one context: on hills, it would climb up to the right reading fairly quickly but lag in terms of dropping back down on the downhills.Â </p>

<p>Looking at the other two comparison charts, it&apos;s difficult to say if COROS or Fitbit are necessarily better or worse. Both brands consistently underreported their heart rates by about 1 bpm, which is annoying. However, they didn&apos;t have quite as much difficulty adjusting to quick heart rate changes.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gLhvgmgqRrEA5ebrRxXpAk" name="COROS-PACE-3-HR-vs-Polar-H10.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and COROS PACE 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLhvgmgqRrEA5ebrRxXpAk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2277" height="1281" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The COROS PACE 3 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a five-mile run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We know Fitbit has Google&apos;s HR algorithm to thank for that, while COROS just did a good job on its own.Â </p><p>Moving on to the results for my track sprint workout, it&apos;s more difficult to determine accuracy because my Polar H10 had bizarrely deflated results for about 15 seconds early on (as seen in the graph above). So, while the Forerunner 165 and Charge 6 (173 bpm) were higher than the H10 and PACE 3 (172 bpm), I think Garmin and Fitbit might be on point this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Garmin Forerunner 165 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1880" height="1058" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Forerunner 165 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That part aside, the Forerunner 165 was once again close but always lagging slightly behind the chest strap as I switched from sprints to jogs and back. It averages out well enough in my mind, but if you&apos;re someone fixated on exact specs, you might not be fully satisfied.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3qodW73bBjNuVvZJ2k2Fmj" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Fitbit Charge 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qodW73bBjNuVvZJ2k2Fmj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1860" height="1046" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fitbit Charge 6 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the competing options, the Fitbit Charge 6 impressed me. The chart shows how it reacts almost in lockstep with the Polar H10 to changing heart rate data. It did read slightly low in most cases, but this could be in part because I was wearing it higher up my wrist than normal to make room for the Forerunner 165.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1865px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NBvb6rEzZHBWSSjU4XX49j" name="COROS-PACE-3-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and COROS PACE 3 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBvb6rEzZHBWSSjU4XX49j.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1865" height="1049" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The COROS PACE 3 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The PACE 3 did adequately enough, but had more issues than the Forerunner 165 with lagging data. There are a few major discrepancies where it rose higher than it should have, or failed to rise at all. That said, it did hit a very reasonable average HR, so I wouldn&apos;t be too disappointed with the results.Â </p>
<h2 id="gps-accuracy-2">GPS accuracy</h2>
<p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 doesn&apos;t have the dual-frequency GPS tracking of the more expensive Forerunners, but it does have an "All-Systems mode" that pulls from GPS and another satellite system like GLONASS or GALILEO simultaneously for better results. Meanwhile, the COROS PACE 3 does have top-tier dual-band tracking, while the Fitbit Charge 6 only uses GPS or GLONASS individually, with some help from your smartphone GPS if you use "Dynamic GPS" mode.Â </p><p>Also, COROS and Garmin gave their respective running watches an altimeter to judge elevation, something the Fitbit Charge 6 lacks â so it estimates based on GPS data.Â </p>

<p>Garmin and COROS were relatively close to one another, while Fitbit&apos;s GPS-only results seemed to overestimate how far I&apos;d run and my pace as a result. That <em>especially</em> applies to my elevation gain: My route had hills, but Fitbit&apos;s estimate really exaggerated how high they were.Â </p><p>Looking at the actual GPS satellite map, the Fitbit Charge 6 was predictably inaccurate, straying wildly off the path. So, I focused instead on the two watches that I could actually count upon to be reasonably accurate: the Forerunner 165 and COROS PACE 3. In the screenshots below, Garmin&apos;s path is pink, while COROS&apos; route is orange.Â </p>

<p>In each case, Garmin "won" the accuracy battle. I generally stayed on the right side of the path in both directions. In Garmin&apos;s measurement, it showed me closer to the middle in both directions, while COROS consistently showed me running in the grass and dirt alongside the path.Â </p><p>Does this matter? Given the similar overall distance, it&apos;s hard to say. If GPS inaccuracy of any kind frustrates you, you&apos;ll want to look at a more expensive, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">higher-end Garmin watch</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> or higher. I&apos;m personally satisfied that these results are trustworthy compared to GPS-only watches.Â </p>

<p>Turning to my track workout, I ran my four laps entirely in the third lane so I could compare the watches&apos; fidelity in satellite view. Garmin, COROS, and Fitbit have pink, orange, and blue lines, respectively.Â </p><p>With the Garmin Forerunner 165, the watch would show me in the second or third lane on curves and the beginning of straightaways, then drift closer to the inner lanes over time. I suspect this was the watch filling in gaps in coverage, pulling my actual location to the left because I would eventually turn left. The tracked distance was exactly right at 1,660 meters, but that&apos;s probably because I marked myself as in the third lane in the pre-activity settings.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="W7QrcqZzJa2BDeCCoaXJn7" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-fitbit-charge-6-coros-pace-3-gps-track-test-2.jpeg" alt="A satellite map of a track, showing the author's location while wearing the COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7QrcqZzJa2BDeCCoaXJn7.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2406" height="1353" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>COROS&apos; track results mirrored what I noted in my original PACE 3 review: They&apos;re not as accurate as expected. My GPS map showed me way off in the right-side lanes for most of the run and cutting across the inner track on one of the turns. Even though its 1,658-meter result was accurate, that&apos;s (again) because COROS has a Track Run activity that lets you set a lane.Â </p><p>On the other hand, at least the PACE 3 and Forerunner 165 were <em>consistent</em> in their slight inaccuracies. The Fitbit Charge 6 wavered wildly across lanes as if I was purposefully doing sidesteps (or slightly drunk). The distance (1,625 meters) was more noticeably off, even after I forgot to turn it off and walked off the track to cool down. The GPS-only tracking and the lack of a Track Run activity mode hurt Fitbit&apos;s ability to compete, here.Â </p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 deserves its place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> for frugal runners, right alongside the COROS PACE 3 and Fitbit Charge 6. Each has its respective strengths, however.</p><p>The Fitbit Charge 6 has reliable heart rate results and does more with that data. Garmin and COROS do support HRV data for stress and recovery, but only the Charge 6 measures AFib both actively and passively, along with skin temperature. It&apos;s the lightest and cheapest watch of the three â though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a> will close the gap after the 6-month free trial and one annual subscription â and has a few Google app perks you&apos;ll appreciate, like Maps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Wallet</a>.</p><p>The COROS PACE 3 has a fantastic 24-day battery life, 38-hour GPS, and 15-hour dual-frequency GPS, crushing the 7-day Charge 6 and the 11-day Forerunner 165. The trade-off is its dull MIP display, which makes it less enjoyable to look at in non-fitness contexts. What matters more for runners is that it gets the full extent of COROS&apos; training analysis, like Training Load and Status, while the Forerunner 165 is artificially restricted from certain metrics to upsell you to the 265.Â </p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 won for step and GPS location accuracy, despite not having the most accurate satellite tech that Garmin offers. It also held its own for HR accuracy, even if it could have been better. I simply wish that Garmin had given the Forerunner 165 the Training Load metric. I can make do without Training Status or Readiness, but it&apos;s hard not knowing whether you&apos;re staying consistent on activity level compared to past weeks.</p><p>Overall, I&apos;m really happy with the results for my three favorite fitness trackers, and feel comfortable recommending the Forerunner 165 if you can make do without the upgrades that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> or 265 offers.

<ul><li>Reddit has introduced a new ad format, dubbed free-form ads, designed to look similar to regular user posts.</li><li>Free-form ads incorporate various formats, such as images, videos, and text, within a single post using templates.</li><li>Early data shows promising results, with free-form ads garnering 28% more clicks and increased engagement compared to other ad formats.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reddit has launched a fresh ad format that&apos;s crafted to blend right in with regular user posts.</p><p>The new ad style, known as free-form ads, lets advertisers engage with users just like regular posts, aiming to get the most interaction possible. These ads allow advertisers to mix it up with different formats in one post, like images, videos, and text, thanks to handy templates.</p><p>Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/advertise-like-a-redditor-with-our-all-new-completely-unique-ad-format-free-form-ads" target="_blank">mentions</a> that the ad format is inspired by one of the platform&apos;s favorite post types: megathreads. These megatrends act as hubs for discussions on hot topics, making them a go-to spot for users.</p><p>According to the company, this new format could be perfect for things like product launches or getting a brand in front of a fresh audience. Like other ads on Reddit, users can tell the difference between free-form ads and regular posts because they&apos;ll have a "Promoted" label next to the company&apos;s name, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/reddit-introduces-a-new-ad-format-that-looks-similar-to-posts-made-by-users/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/reddit-updates-feed-search-2023">Reddit</a> mentioned that these new ads are its most native format yet, made to look similar to community content shared by users. Reddit is hoping you won&apos;t even notice it&apos;s an ad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.55%;"><img id="7zUDhvPiXmrm42ksxiB3fQ" name="Reddit-Clicking-Through-Templates.gif" alt="Reddit's  new ad format" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zUDhvPiXmrm42ksxiB3fQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2200" height="1332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reddit clarified that the open-ended design of these ads will grant advertisers more room to get creative and spark conversations with Redditors. However, while the new format might appeal to advertisers, ads that resemble regular posts might not be well-received by users.</p><p>Despite concerns, early results indicate that the initiative is paying off. According to Reddit&apos;s data, free-form ads received 28% more clicks than other ad formats on the site and witnessed an increase in engagement.</p><p>The new ad format is now available to all advertisers on Reddit worldwide through the Reddit Ads Manager.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Depending on how much of a phone nerd you are, you may never have even thought about what Google Play Services actually is. You could be forgiven for dismissing it as a dry and technical part of Android, but in reality, it&apos;s a crucially important part of the way the OS works. Essentially, it&apos;s what puts the <em>Google</em> into Android, influencing everything from security to Google integration with the apps you use every day.</p>
<p>Google Play Services was announced in 2014 as a way to introduce new features to Android phones in a way that didn&apos;t require a firmware update. That&apos;s because back in 2014, before the days of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11-security-updates-progress" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11-security-updates-progress">monthly security patches</a>, even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> were often left waiting months for crucial fixes. And forcing users to wait for a full firmware update to protect against malicious apps or tweak the way Google features worked was less than ideal.</p>
<p>So there are benefits for everyone. Developers get important APIs that work across the vast majority of the active Android user base. (At the time of writing, every device since 5.0 Lollipop supports the "current" Google Play Services version.) Users, in turn, benefit from this through new features and security fixes, even if they&apos;re not running the latest OS version. And for Google, Play Services acts as insurance against the rise of "forked" Android, as we&apos;ve seen through the difficulties faced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fcc-huawei-zte-communications-usa-ban">Huawei when it was blacklisted</a> a few years ago.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-than-just-an-app"><span>More than just an app</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kYLd8oCULjmdAuCAfdcVDN" name="Google-Play-Services-hero.jpeg" alt="Close-up of Google Play Services app info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kYLd8oCULjmdAuCAfdcVDN.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alex Dobie / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Services</a> is essentially just an app, controlled by Google, which updates automatically in the background on every Google-certified Android phone. There&apos;s not really any user-facing part of the app unless you count the "Google Settings" part of the Settings app. But Play Services&apos; various tendrils are spread throughout Android, especially in newer versions of the OS.</p>
<p>As a system-level "app," Play Services can run with elevated permissions and supersede anything and everything in the OS if it needs to. Google has expanded Play Services&apos; capabilities extensively since it was introduced way back in 2014, and the company can easily modify it to do even more in the future.</p>
<p>To put it simply: if an Android app interacts with a Google service, chances are it&apos;s doing so through Google Play Services.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>For apps, Play Services acts as a gateway to Google services on your phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Google Play Services client library gives developers APIs to make apps work with Google services on devices with the Play Services app installed. This includes Cloud Messaging, Drive, Location, Play Games, Wear OS and Google Pay, to name just a few. And because the Play Services app updates automatically in the background and works on all versions of Android going back to Lollipop, Google can roll out changes, improvements, and new features in Android&apos;s integration with these services without a firmware update. That means the carriers and device manufacturers aren&apos;t in the loop at all, so Google is in complete control of the rollout.</p>
<p>While the Android firmware update situation has improved considerably since Play Services launched in 2014, a Play Services update can still be pushed out much, much quicker than a traditional over-the-air update. As a result, Play Services lets Google move at pace when introducing new features and services for Android.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fw9XbY2Htg5MdJd684tKD6" name="NHS COVID-19 app lifestyle.jpg" alt="NHS COVID-19 app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fw9XbY2Htg5MdJd684tKD6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A great example of this is the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System, developed in cooperation with Apple. On the Android side, the ENS was added in the background as a Play Services update to every Android phone running firmware from 2014 or later. And when a glitch with the system occurred earlier in 2021, Google could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nhs-covid-19-app-showing-permanent-loading-notification-youre-not-alone" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/NHS-covid-19-app-showing-permanent-loading-notification-youre-not-alone">fix it almost immediately</a> across the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Without Google Play Services, rolling out anything like the COVID-19 ENS would likely have required herculean effort from manufacturers and carriers to develop and certify updated firmware for every Android phone in the world.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google couldn't have built its Exposure Notification System without Play Services.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also good for developers and users for many other reasons, most of which are pretty obvious once you think about it. Rather than devs having to worry about targeting each of these Google features differently across OS versions, the heavy lifting is done by Play Services. What&apos;s more, users aren&apos;t left in the lurch if they&apos;re not running the latest version of Android. (And even in 2024, there are still a <em><strong>lot</strong></em> of users not running the latest version of Android.)</p>
<p>Through Play Services, many things thought to be Android features â like Google location services or Google Play Games â have been decoupled from the core OS. That&apos;s another reason why directly comparing iOS and Android version distribution doesn&apos;t tell the whole story. A very significant part of the Google Android experience is kept up-to-date, automatically, in the background.</p>
<p>Google has continued this push towards more modularity in Android in the years since Play Services first arrived. Most notably in Android 10, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/project-mainline" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/project-mainline">"Project Mainline,"</a> a.k.a. Google Play System Updates, allowed parts of the OS itself, like Wi-Fi, tethering, and neural networking components, to be updated by Google without requiring a full firmware update. In Android 12, Google expanded Mainline to include the Android runtime itself, the part that runs your apps. That of all makes Android much more secure, even if your phone isn&apos;t running the latest platform update.</p>
<p>It&apos;s true that some changes, fixes, and improvements still require a firmware update. But in today&apos;s Android ecosystem, there&apos;s a ton of really important stuff that no longer does.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-a-firewall-against-malware"><span>A firewall against malware</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u5VYEReQmUxKVZKFDkMmyA" name="Google-Play-Protect-app.jpeg" alt="Google Play Protect app showing recently scanned apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u5VYEReQmUxKVZKFDkMmyA.jpeg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6XmS228RRjggVFKn8Bp2gB.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Play Services also has an enormous role to play in securing older Android phones against bad apps, which generally come from app stores other than the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>The main weapon in Google&apos;s arsenal is Google Play Protect, which is effectively Android&apos;s built-in virus scanner. When you&apos;re installing an app from a third-party location, it&apos;s scanned by this constantly updated feature to identify malicious tendencies, and Play Protect will also periodically scan your phone in the background. This is a big part of why scary-sounding Android security bugs like 2015&apos;s "Fake ID" never end up taking off. Thanks to Play Services, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-android-security-fearmongering-bs" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-android-security-fearmongering-bs">the vast majority of Android devices are protected</a>, and offending apps are nipped in the bud almost immediately.</p>
<p>You could say this is a stopgap solution, since the underlying vulnerability isn&apos;t fixed until a firmware update or Project Mainline update is rolled out. But either way, the malware&apos;s not getting through, and users are protected â even if they&apos;re running an older Android security patch level.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-s-android-insurance-policy"><span>Google's Android insurance policy</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vhsuMTfoorASBEjLJ2T66U" name="Android Bugdroid statue lifestyle.jpg" alt="Android Bugdroid statue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vhsuMTfoorASBEjLJ2T66U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Play Services is packed with proprietary Google stuff, and as such, isn&apos;t included in the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP). Like other Google apps, it&apos;s closed-source. Any "fork" of open-source Android â a version built off AOSP without Google&apos;s involvement â is on its own in terms of having to recreate what Play Services provides.</p>
<p>Nothing is stopping a manufacturer wanting to build an Android device without getting GMS (Google Mobile Services) approval from building their own service layer instead of Play Services. For example, Huawei has done exactly that with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-finalizing-google-services-replacements-year-end-launch-sight" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-finalizing-google-services-replacements-year-end-launch-sight">Huawei Mobile Services</a> layer. But such an endeavor represents a huge technical challenge, so for most manufacturers who aren&apos;t legally compelled to <em>not</em> work with Google, it&apos;s easier to just license Play Services along with the rest of GMS.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Android may be open source, but Play Services definitely isn't.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Just as Play Services is a solution to some of Android&apos;s inherent weaknesses â the slow pace of firmware updates due to the number of moving parts involved, and the app development and security implications of this â the lack of Play Services in Android forks creates significant engineering work for anyone serious about taking Android away from Google. In effect, it&apos;s an insurance policy that guarantees Google long-term control of Android â at least everywhere outside of mainland China.</p>
<p>That&apos;s not to say this is necessarily part of any diabolical Google master plan, yet this is the situation that exists. An operating system like Android can only gobble up market share with the help of device (and carrier) diversity. Diversity inevitably leads to fragmentation, and to combat that, you need a service and security layer that exists outside the OS.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the challenge that any convincing fork of Android needs to solve, and it&apos;s not an easy one. In the meantime, those in the Google Android world have Play Services to thank for enabling the platform&apos;s growth and helping keep phones secure.</p>

<p>It&apos;s nice being able to pick and choose what phone I want to use on a daily basis. Usually, whenever I get a new phone, that becomes the "standard" for a while. That was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> until the Galaxy S24 Ultra arrived, giving me a reason to go back to a "slab" phone.</p><p>Leading up to that point, I had already gotten a little bored of the Open, but not because of the phone itself. That&apos;s just the nature of the beast when it comes to someone who plays around with new phones and technology for a living. Boredom is probably the best way to describe it. So, honestly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> arrived at the perfect time.</p><p>Fast forward to now, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra lasted a little less than two months before I decided that enough was enough and that slab phones no longer interested me.</p><p>For a little bit of context, I have been using the OnePlus Open in tandem with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> ever since it was announced. That&apos;s a little over three months, squeaking past the two-and-a-half months I spent with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-a-week-with-the-z-fold-5-coming-home">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-04.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few years, I&apos;ve learned that the majority of the time spent using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> is from the cover screen. So why would I want to go back to a foldable phone when the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s display is way better than that of the OnePlus Open or Z Fold 5? Well, it&apos;s a simple and obvious answer â it doubles as a pocketable tablet.</p><p>This has been the thing that keeps drawing me back to foldable phones, even as I&apos;ve grown tired of Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-z-fold-5-doesnt-change-much-over-the-z-fold-4">refusing to upgrade</a> anything but the processor on the Z Fold lineup. I can go from scrolling Reddit or logging the latest poopy diaper on the outer screen to trying to get some work done in just moments.Â </p><p>Not to mention the multitasking capabilities of having multiple app windows open at the same time without feeling overly cramped. This is somewhat of a testament to OnePlus&apos; unique Open Canvas feature, letting you use three apps in full-screen and switching between them. But, it&apos;s also still quite nice being able to just open more than just two apps and actually use them.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="daj4UqvkxFQCW2oR3iFipG" name="oneplus-open-24.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/daj4UqvkxFQCW2oR3iFipG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the OnePlus Open kind of saved me, it&apos;s not without flaws of its own. OxygenOS continues to be janky from time to time, such as the taskbar getting in the way of me tapping into the text field within Telegram. Not to mention that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-open-android-14-oxygenos-update-united-states">Android 14 for the Open</a>Â <em>just</em>Â arrived here in the U.S. after only being available in India for some time. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 Ultra launched with Android 14 out of the box, and the Galaxy Z Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-5-flip-5-stable-one-ui-6-android-14-update">received its update</a> in November of last year.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's still too much jankiness in OxygenOS on the OnePlus Open.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to know that outside of the foldable form factor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a better phone in pretty much every way. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">cameras alone</a> are enough of a reason why this is the case, not to mention the new and improved display that looks so darn impressive.</p><p>I don&apos;t even have a ton of complaints when it comes to One UI, although a few things are missing that I still don&apos;t understand. One such example is that there&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-conversation-widgets-android-12">Conversation Widget</a> available on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, despite being made available when Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>. Surprisingly, it&apos;s there on the OnePlus Open, and I&apos;ve been grateful for that.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>But it doesn't fold.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>After coming home from the hospital with a newborn in tow, I quickly realized how cumbersome and awkward it was to play finger gymnastics with only one free hand. Yes, I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">MagSafe case</a> with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-popsockets">PopSocket</a> on the S24 Ultra, but that doesn&apos;t quite solve the problem in most instances. So, I decided to give the OnePlus Open another shake, and while it&apos;s almost the same size, the differences are such that it&apos;s simply more comfortable to use.</p><p>While the Open is definitely a hefty device to use while closed, it&apos;s a half-inch smaller than the Galaxy S24 Ultra. That makes one-handed use much easier, as I don&apos;t have to try and strain my fingers trying to reach one of the corners. Which is quite important when the little one wants to take a nap on your chest. Most of the time, I just have to give up doing what I was trying to do on the S24 Ultra until I can use my other hand.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve even been thinking about giving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> another go, as the narrow cover screen, which I like to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">complain</a> about, is practically perfect. At this point, I might just go back to the Fold 5 to see whether much has changed. I know it really hasn&apos;t, but in my head, there&apos;s a chance that I might fall back in love with the Fold 5.</p><p>I&apos;m also in this weird space of wanting to pay super-close attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> rumor mill. This mightÂ finallyÂ be the year that Samsung revamps the hardware, giving us proper cameras and an inner display crease that doesn&apos;t do its best Grand Canyon impersonation. At this point, I couldn&apos;t even tell you what the rumors are suggesting. It&apos;s been a practice of tempering my expectations, which is quite a difficult task for me.</p>

<p>There&apos;s really nothing wrong with the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> that money can buy, at least if you&apos;re in North America and don&apos;t want a foldable. Even with the camera "side-grades" and the exorbitant price tag, you&apos;d have a tough time finding a more complete package.</p><p>While we might not have as many options as those living abroad, I&apos;m still thankful that there are at least some options to choose from. And before we know it, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be here, potentially complicating my decision. For now, I&apos;ll be sticking with the OnePlus Open and maybe giving the Z Fold 5 another chance.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-xa0-2">What you need to knowÂ </h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 is expected to introduce a Powered Off Finder API.</li><li>This API will enable compatible devices to be tracked even when switched off.</li><li>The feature is expected to be available on the Google Pixel 9 series, and the Pixel 8 series.</li></ul>
<p>Google has been hard at work on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-version-3-update">Find My Device network</a> but has not yet made the system widely available to users. However, recent reports suggest that a Powered Off Finder API will be a standout feature of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> when it rolls out, most likely in the second half of 2024.</p><p>As reported by Android Police, the feature will allow compatible phones to be located even when they are switched off. The system works by allowing the handset to broadcast Bluetooth beacons to other Android devices that are part of the Find My Device network. The receiving devices will then encrypt and upload the device&apos;s location, transmitting the beacon to Googleâs server and allowing the device&apos;s owner to see where it is.</p>
<p>According to the report, this feature will only work on devices with specific hardware support that allows them to power the Bluetooth controller even when the phone is shut down. For that reason, it will not work on all Android devices.</p><p>Itâs expected that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series will be the first compatible handset to benefit from this feature. But interestingly, it also appears that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will also be able to support the API, as well as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. Older devices, including the Pixel 7 series and the Pixel Fold, donât appear to have the necessary software support to operate Powered Off Finding.</p>

<p>This would make sense; back in April 2023, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-find-my-device-phone-off-rumor">we reported</a> that Google was working on a Find My Device feature. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">Google even announced</a> the feature at I/O 2023, stating it would arrive âlater this summer.â At that point, it was believed that the feature was being designed to work with the Pixel 8 when it launched later that year.</p><p>The release of Powered Off Finding was subsequently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-version-3-update">pushed back</a> while Google and Apple collaborated to solve the problem of unwanted location tracking. While Google offers unknown tracker alerts that can detect Bluetooth trackers, including AirTags, an equivalent does not currently exist on iOS. At the moment, Apple devices can detect AirTags but cannot detect trackers that arenât connected to Appleâs Find My network.Â Â </p><p>Google and Apple have been working together since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-apple-partner-tackle-unwanted-location-tracking">May 2023</a> to create a joint specification based on Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers (DULT). The hope is that Android devices will soon start to benefit from this feature.Â </p>
