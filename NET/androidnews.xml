<ul><li>An X post by AI analyst claimed that the new DeepSeek AI is being powered by Huawei’s Ascend 910C chip.</li><li>Although the model was first trained on Nvidia's H100, the company is now shifting gears to get a more domestic product.</li><li>The X post also claims that  DeepSeek might train its next AI model using  32,000 Huawei 910C chips.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>DeepSeek AI is the new bot on the block these days, and this Chinese AI model is going head-to-head with other U.S.-based AI companies.</p><p>While understanding how this large language model is gaining its skills, in a recent X post, AI analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=803X112721&xs=1&url=https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/1884167945280278857&xcust=4-1-2591529-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2591529/deepseek-ai-confirmed-to-be-powered-by-a-huawei-chip.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alexander Doria</a> confirmed the chip that powers DeepSeek. Doria stated that DeepSeek’s R1 large-language model (LLM) was first trained using Nvidia’s H100 but now it fully functions on Huawei’s Ascend 910C chip to generate responses. (via Tech Advisor.)</p><p>Even though the 910C chip isn't as dominant as the Nvidia's H100, the  Chinese company wants to keep the chip domestic instead of going with U.S. based cores, reducing their reliability on expensive chips. Presumably, DeepSeek is testing its LLM to operate as good as it did on Nvidia chips.</p><p>"910C are (slightly) less performant and, even more importantly, does not come yet with a good interconnect which is critical for training," Doria added.</p><p>This could potentially bridge the gap between companies needing expensive chips that could power their AI models, functioning on par with big tech AI.  Additionally, Doria stated that DeepSeek might train its next AI model (V4) using  32,000 Huawei 910C chips. However, it remains to be seen how the Chinese chip maker will meet this demand, however 'chip independence' is something that the Chinese companies are working on, to help them become autonomous.</p><p>The DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model that's built on the V3 large language model and is claimed to be developed at a fraction of the cost—  under $6 million to train its model. When compared to U.S. brands like ChatGPT that shelled out millions of dollars to create almost the same AI experience.</p><p>"The next chip, the 920c, is aiming for B200 performance (the current Nvidia flagship)."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I feel this should be a much bigger story: DeepSeek has trained on Nvidia H800 but is running inference on the new home Chinese chips made by Huawei, the 910C. pic.twitter.com/6IAgQlQ3ou<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884167945280278857">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Despite using a moderately powerful chip, DeepSeek's AI is outperforming U.S AI rivals like chat GPT AI model. For instance,  DeepSeek V3, has become extremely efficient at complex tasks like coding and essay writing.</p><p>DeepSeek's impact has already started to take effect as Nvidia, took a massive hit on Monday, losing $593 billion in market value as tech stocks tanked, marking the biggest one-day loss any company has ever seen on Wall Street.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This review brings back a bit of nostalgia. One of my all-time favorite MP3 players was the iRiver iFP-180T, pre-iPod, circa 2002. The Activo P1 I’ve been using for some time has iRiver roots, both owned by Korean parent company Dreamus. With that pedigree, the Activo P1 looks more like an iRiver project than something from the angular, metal builds of Astell & Kern’s luxury-priced DAP laboratory.</p><p>Despite looking more iRiver than Astell & Kern, what the Activo P1 doesn’t do is skimp on A&K quality in build or functionality. In a time where people are trying to minimize distractions, a DAP like this could fit into your life nicely as your everyday carry, wired or wireless, standalone music source, though that Google Play Store access may tempt you to add non-music apps.</p>


<h2 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for-a-lot-2">You get what you pay for: A lot!</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="FJaz5w3kBabhMeJft7tjSH" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-back" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing the aluminum and polycarbonate backside of the device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJaz5w3kBabhMeJft7tjSH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="1824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Launched on July 22, 2024, the Activo P1 is available for $430, which may seem like a lot of money for a digital audio player. That price point is “accessible” when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/best-mp3-players">compare it to the cost of some of Astell & Kern’s other digital audio players</a> — I’ll refer to them as DAPs going forward — which can cost upwards of $1,000 or more.</p><p>It should be noted that the P1 is sold as the P1 by Astell & Kern in North America, in a few other regions, and on Amazon.com. In the UK, Germany, Japan, China, and other parts of the world, it is sold as the ACTIVO P1. The body, accessories, features, and firmware are the same regardless of the name and region. The only material difference will be the packaging.</p><p>So, what exactly do you get for $430? Cracking the box open gives a hint of the refinement on offer. You’ll find the P1, a screen protector, one short and one long USB-C cable, the warranty card, and some vouchers to check out Roon. The exterior feels sturdy — a solid build that feels great in hand, with aluminum for most of the body and white plastic polycarbonate at the top and bottom.</p><p>You’ll get multiple ways to enjoy your music as the DAP plays files locally from the 64GB of built-in storage or the microSD slot, which supports up to 1.5TB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD SDHC and SDXC cards</a>. Then there’s the Bluetooth 5.3 connection, which supports various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">audio codecs</a> such as aptX HD, LDAC, LHDC, and the lower-quality AAC and SBC formats.</p><p>Of course, it’s the wired connections that are the stars of this show, with the P1 supporting almost every “physical” file format from WAV to FLAC to ALAC and no shortage of playback and sampling rates with up to PCM 32bit/384kHz, MQA, and up to DSD256 native decoding.</p><p>All of this is powered by an octa-core CPU, an ESS SABRE ES9219Q dual DAC chip, A&K’s Teraton audio solution, and an A&K simplified version of Android. Your file streaming is powered by dual-band WiFi 5 support, so you’ll have no problems downloading larger files or streaming them over the internet or from your local network with Roon support.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="T2gbEbsoVNyQJEt5q3GagH" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-power-play-pause-buttons2" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing the power and play/pause buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2gbEbsoVNyQJEt5q3GagH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="1824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A nice touch in the design department is the ability to control the player via physical buttons. You get volume controls on the left side, and play/pause on the right so if the screen is off you don’t need to wake the player to control your tunes.</p>
<h2 id="wonderful-astell-kern-sound-at-a-discount-2">Wonderful Astell&Kern sound at a "discount"</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2287px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="yxVnK8oaiU4JUrHyVWEGhG" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-audio-ports" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing the 3.5mm and 4.4mm audio ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yxVnK8oaiU4JUrHyVWEGhG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2287" height="1286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To test the sound quality of this high-end DAP, I used Sennheieser’s HD660S2, Drop’s HiFiMan HE-4XX, Campfire Audio Mammoth IEMs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/noble-fokus-apollo-review">Noble’s FoKus Apollo</a> hybrid driver over-ears (a first in over-ear design). I used the 3.5mm, 4.4mm, and Bluetooth connections for playback.</p><p>I streamed from Tidal and Amazon Music’s hi-res collection. I also played MP3 files and FLAC files with native DSD decoding. I love how the P1’s built-in music player’s folder structure identifies your MQA, PCM, and DSD files under its MQS tab so that you can get right to them. I also used the P1 as a Bluetooth DAC and USB-C DAC, connected to my 2017 10-core iMac Pro, playing ALAC files from my Apple Music library.</p><p>After listening to 24bit/96kHz “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” by Paul Simon, 48kHz MQA “How Long Blues” by Ray Charles and Milt Jackson, 2.8MHz DSD “Thriller” and “Human Nature” by Michael Jackson, and 11.2MHz DSF “Wicked Game” by Aisyah, I was definitely impressed with the audio quality from that SABRE Dual-DAC augmented by Astell’s Teraton Alpha solution, found in its higher-priced DAPs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="jSNM8WLWrhTyym7T4KaYEJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-human-nature-mj.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing the stock music player, playing "Human Nature" by Michael Jackson" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSNM8WLWrhTyym7T4KaYEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The stock sound is beautiful, entertaining, and engaging. It has tight reproduction at the bottom and restrained clarity at the top, so you’re not met with sibilance or shrill horns on tracks rendered with those qualities from more analytical DACs mated to equally analytical headphones or IEMs.</p><p>Despite the restraint in the high frequencies, the vocal mids don’t feel cramped at all, and voices that register into those higher frequencies, like that of Aisyah’s in “Wicked Game,” are delightfully airy and ethereal.</p><p>Listening to hip-hop tracks from The Roots, Kendrick Lamar, and the Beastie Boys, the bass attack with the Boom Bap should satisfy any bassheads reading this. That 808 resonance is delicious, but if the stock sound’s bass isn’t boomy enough for you, there’s a 20-band PEQ with Q-factor bandwidth adjustments to fix that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VQgDHLisBYwm88LrWhJpUg" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-shown-with-headphones-iems.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 with headphones, IEMs, and true wireless earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQgDHLisBYwm88LrWhJpUg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>USB and Bluetooth DAC modes don’t allow you to use the 20-band parametric EQ. Still, your wired or Bluetooth connection directly to headphones or IEMs does, and it’s a glorious playground for tailoring the sound curve to your “sonic palette.”</p><p>In one instance, I was listening to a pair of headphones that appeared to have some issues with the lows being super aggressive and masking higher-frequency sounds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="HGbKHQkvnfPG9vN8kkhzDJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-peq-main.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing 20-band parametric equalizer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HGbKHQkvnfPG9vN8kkhzDJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>I used the Q factor to adjust the bandwidth in the 45Hz and 60Hz bands and was able to mitigate most of that bass bleeding into the mids and masking the highs. This may not work well with a single-driver unit, but this pair utilizes a hybrid driver design, combining dynamic and planar drivers.</p><p>Just like anything, the P1 isn’t a magic bullet for sound. Listening to it via crappy headphones or IEMs isn’t going to give you the best results, considering what you’re paying for the DAP. With any setup, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review">spend the most</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wired-earbuds-are-making-a-comeback-and-im-excited">on your IEMs</a> or headphones <em><strong>first.</strong></em> <em>Then</em>, buy a DAC or DAP with what’s left in your budget.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life-2">Battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5R4fuaw8qbUDEnyyaRRgEJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-battery-protection-mode.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing the Power and Battery menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5R4fuaw8qbUDEnyyaRRgEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is definitely a DAP you can listen to for hours without it being fatiguing, and the 2,700mAh battery supports that. I have the battery saver turned on so that the Activo P1 stops charging at 85%. With the music set to 75% max volume and mixed-use, playing from local storage, and utilizing Wi-Fi to stream Tidal tracks, I drained that battery by 60% in seven hours.</p><p>If you drain the P1, it is PD 3.0-compatible for fast charging speeds. Using a 65-watt PD charger, I charged the unit to 85% from dead in one hour.</p>
<h2 id="improvements-for-the-next-gen-activo-p1-2">Improvements for the next-gen Activo P1</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="J6dgrywHDvChNYkaSaVbNJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-homescreen.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6dgrywHDvChNYkaSaVbNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though the addition of Android to the Activo P1 makes the interface a bit faster and smoother than A&K’s in-house DAP OS, it can be a bit slow to boot, taking around 40 seconds most of the time. Once booted, the automatic scan of your local and microSD folders is lightning-fast.</p><p>With all of the headphones I used, I had to crank the volume, so you’re likely to run the battery down a bit quicker than the 20 hours of continuous playback that Astell & Kern advertises on its Activo website. Even with the most sensitive IEMs that I’ve used with multiple DACs and have to keep the volume quite low, I had to listen at 80% to 90% of max. The P1 has 150 steps of volume adjustment, and I regularly listened at 100-125 with closed-back and open-back headphones, respectively.</p>

<p>It's not something that necessarily needs improving, but it is worth noting that the P1 does get warm to the touch after a while—not uncomfortably so, but it is noticeable.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3431px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="bp43c4fjHRcjJ3Kww7xuxH" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-usb-c-microsd2" alt="Astell & Kern Activo P1 showing USB-C and microSD ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bp43c4fjHRcjJ3Kww7xuxH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3431" height="1929" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike some of Astell & Kern’s pricier options, the Activo P1 is aimed at those looking for an everyday carry device that you won’t feel like you have to “white glove.” It has no water-resistance rating, so be mindful of that if you live in wetter climates. In wet or dry climates, I’d pick up a case, which can be difficult to find. Activo sells a white silicone case, and I’ve found a couple of PU leather cases on Amazon.</p><p>The Activo P1 is an excellent choice for a “do-everything” DAP that can also augment your computer or laptop-based listening sessions as a DAC if the price tag isn't an issue for you. For a “budget” Astell & Kern digital audio player, the Activo P1 doesn’t feel cheap or compromised.</p>

<ul><li>Meta announced its Q4 2024 earnings.</li><li>The company reported $48 billion in revenue, a 21% YoY increase driven primarily by family of apps ads revenue.</li><li>Reality Labs reported its highest-ever revenue quarter with $1.08 billion in revenue offset by $4.9 billion in operating costs.</li><li>Over 3.3 billion people used Meta apps and services in Q4 2024.</li><li>Zuckerberg teased a new, more personalized AI it expects to launch this year and reach 1 billion users by 2026.</li></ul>
<p>Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx">reported</a> another record-breaking quarter for Q4 2024, showing a 21% improvement in revenue over the same quarter in 2023. Meta earned $48 billion in revenue during Q4 2024 compared to $40 billion in Q4 2023. The company's full-year earnings totaled $164 billion, a 22% increase over 2023's $134 billion in overall revenue.</p><p>Ads brought in a record-breaking $46.7 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs division also broke records with $1.08 billion in revenue. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that family of apps ad revenue was up for two primary reasons: 3.35 billion people used Meta products and services in 2024, delivering more ad impressions, while the average price per ad simultaneously increased 14% YoY.</p><p>Reality Labs' record-breaking revenue was driven by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> sales, with Zuckerberg commenting that "the number of people using Quest and Horizon is steadily growing." He further described 2025 as a "pivotal year for the metaverse" and teased the company launching more "visually stunning content" soon.</p><p>Zuckerberg also noted that 2025 is the year we'll truly understand if AI glasses are a truly viable long-term product category for the company. Meta is said to be launching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">a pair of Oakley-branded smart glasses</a> this year which should help further drive the product category. Reality Labs still operated at a loss this quarter, with operating expenses totaling nearly $5 billion.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg was positive about the company's leadership in open-source AI despite yesterday's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-ai-is-crushing-the-competition-and-triggering-an-ai-stock-bloodbath">DeepSeek AI launch</a> from China. The CEO noted that its open-source model standardized many supply chain assets and is working toward delivering a further revenue-positive approach throughout the year with multiple expected Llama 4-related AI products.</p><p>Meta will be launching "a new, more personalized AI" this year the company expects to reach 1 billion users by the year's end. Part of the new improvements will include additional memory length whereby Meta AI will be able to remember commands you've given it and be able to reference those, making it feel more like a personalized AI assistant rather than something you ask random questions to.</p><p>This new AI will be different in every region and dialect, helping to give it a more authentic feel rather than a generic AI question-and-answer bank. Zuckerberg also hyped the release of an "AI engineer" sometime in 2025 that will be able to operate with mid-level engineer capabilities. He said this AI engineer will be a "profound" release with potential market opportunities in 2026 and beyond.</p><p>The company teased 2025 as the year "we get back to the OG Facebook" but didn't offer much clarity beyond trying to restore Facebook to its original purpose. Instagram, Reels, WhatsApp, and Threads all grew and are expected to continue to grow throughout 2025, especially given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tries-to-capitalize-on-tiktok-uncertainty-with-new-edits-app">uncertainty around TikTok</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S25 pre-orders in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and the Middle East are starting to ship early, according to buyers.</li><li>The shipments not only have barcodes created, but also have been picked up by their couriers, which is a good sign they may deliver earlier.</li><li>Some users are seeing expected delivery dates as much as a week earlier than the official Feb. 7 release date.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> last week, and pre-orders opened on Jan. 22. For early buyers, there was quite a while between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/three-reasons-to-preorder-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-through-samsung-and-one-reason-why-you-shouldnt">pre-orders opening</a> and the Feb. 7 official release date for the Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup. Those that are eagerly awaiting the delivery of their new flagships may have reason to be excited, because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25/comments/1icycaf/delivery_update/" target="_blank">multiple Reddit users</a> are starting to see their orders shipping already (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2025/01/29/galaxy-s25-ultra-pre-orders-shipping-super-early/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>).</p><p>It's not uncommon for buyers to receive early shipping notifications way before their phones are set to be delivered. Typically, Samsung shipping notifications are sent out when the label is created — which is sometimes days before a new phone is actually picked up by a courier. This time, however, multiple users are seeing their packages moving through shipping networks in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and the Middle East.</p><p>Other smartphone companies, like Apple, have strict polices with partners like UPS and FedEx that prevent packages from being delivered early. Even if a pre-order arrives at its final destination early, it'll often be held at a courier location until the official release date. Samsung, by comparison, has delivered new releases to buyers early — yet another indication that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">Galaxy S25</a> pre-orderers may have something to get excited about.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1ico7in/my_phone_just_shipped_as_well_im_so_excited">My phone just shipped as well! I'm so excited🤩</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy">r/samsunggalaxy</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>As a warning, not all Samsung Galaxy S25 buyers are seeing their orders move through a courier network just yet. Some are merely receiving shipping notifications that a label was created. Once the package has been picked up by a courier and you get an estimated delivery date, there's a good chance your Galaxy S25 could be delivered early. Until then, it might be worthwhile to hold off on the excitement.</p><p>Some people who have placed pre-orders, including at Droid Life, are seeing estimated delivery dates as early as tomorrow, Jan. 30. So, we'll know soon whether these early delivery dates are the real thing or just a tease. It's worth noting that only orders directly from Samsung are likely to ship and delivery early — orders from Best Buy, Amazon, and carriers will probably be held until the official Feb. 7 release date.</p><p>As Droid Life notes, this is one reason to pre-order through Samsung, in addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">promotions and enhanced trade-in values</a>. However, some have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/160jq86/14_day_returns_not_even_close_to_matching_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">expressed concerns with Samsung's return policy in the past</a>, so there are pros and cons.</p>

<p>Ever since Fossil abandoned Wear OS, the Android smartwatch space has had a distinct lack of style. Fossil had software issues it couldn't overcome, but its traditional watch designs were always on point, while Samsung, Google, and Apple barely even try to court the luxury watch crowd today. And I believe the time is right for more hybrid Android smartwatches to fill that gap!</p><p>Over the holidays, I held a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch fashion contest</a>, and it was a wake-up call. As someone immersed in tech for years, I'd grown accustomed to how smartwatches look. But when my non-techy relatives ranked watches from prettiest to ugliest, they crowned the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2 hybrid</a> the best — and called the rest of the smartwatches boring at best and unwearable or ugly at worst.</p><p>Even though Android watches rarely use squircles, we've reached the point that it doesn't <em>matter</em> that they're circular; they still don't look like "watches." Recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watches</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watches</a> maximize display space, so they look like gadgets instead of accessories — especially the smaller models.</p><p>Even the "Classic"-style models are too large, thick, and glaringly bright to blend in. And so these brands have instead pushed in the opposite direction, giving up on "watch" designs and launching massive, expensive models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> — knowing that their core audience and credulous tech reviewers will happily accept it.</p><p>The problem is that this strategy does nothing for folks who want smarts <em>and</em> fashion. Hybrid watches come the closest, but they're hard to find and rarely strike the perfect balance between the two. I suspect that's why, when you look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/global-wearable-band-market-q3-2024">Canalys' 2024 worldwide wearable sales</a>, basic watches still outsell smartwatches by a wide margin.</p><p>Samsung is no stranger to experimenting with multiple watch models every year, and I know it'll likely return to its Classic design with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>. But I wish instead that it would try something new: reach outside of the tech nerd space and pick up where Fossil left off.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-hybrid-smartwatches-2">The problem with hybrid smartwatches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3993px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gPfXqysR7az8zRb2RfVerQ" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Hybrid-Wellness-Edition-review-menu.jpg" alt="The main menu on the Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gPfXqysR7az8zRb2RfVerQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3993" height="2246" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you make a hybrid smartwatch, do you focus more on smarts or the watch? Brands like Fossil, Garmin, and Withings have all made valiant efforts at this question, but I don't think any of them have really nailed the formula.</p><p>Fossil spent years as the main Wear OS option while other brands abandoned it, giving users access to different sub-brand styles — Michael Kors, Skagen Falster, Kate Spade, and so on — with Google's signature apps and assistant. Its lineup included several hybrid models, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/skagen-jorn-hybrid-hr-review">Skagen Jorn</a> to the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-hybrid-wellness-edition-review">Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness</a>.</p><p>Fossil couldn't keep up with the software after the Samsung/Google Wear OS merger and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">gave up on Wear OS last year</a>, leaving a huge gap in the market. Still, Fossil watches were never perfect, with performance and battery life issues; and its hybrid models didn't even necessarily <em>use</em> Wear OS, with limited smarts and functionality without a positive trade-off like longer battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xFrUyeZGXaFzQbJYPGPxVo" name="skagen-jorn-hr-hybrid-smartwatch-skt3102.jpg" alt="Skagen Jorn Hybrid HR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFrUyeZGXaFzQbJYPGPxVo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Skagen Jorn HR hybrid </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skagen)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Withings ScanWatch 2, which has a tiny OLED cutout inside a normal steel interior, Fossil used subtle, eye-friendly e-ink screens that covered the entire hybrid watch face, giving you more room for information. But aside from obstructing watch hands, you had to reckon with E Ink's slow refresh rate when scrolling through long notifications or menus. It was only best suited for static information.</p><p>Withings' tiny-display strategy pays off with longer battery life and a design that looks eminently "normal" when you aren't receiving notifications. If you want a watch that tracks your health data but wouldn't look out of place in a business environment, the ScanWatch 2 or its more expensive siblings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-announced">ScanWatch Nova</a> are where I'd start.</p><p>Still, the ScanWatch 2's tiny screen barely fits any data, making reading notifications annoying. More importantly, for this discussion, you're mostly wearing this watch for health and sleep data. It's much more limited than what you're used to with a traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>, with no apps or Assistant.</p><p>I also reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a>, which looks surprisingly stylish from a brand that's well-known for its thick, sporty designs. However, the Trend had issues with a finicky touchscreen and slow performance, which seems to be a trend (no pun intended) with hybrid watches.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-d-want-out-of-a-wear-os-hybrid-smartwatch-2">What I'd want out of a Wear OS hybrid smartwatch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GVmCtt8AGjyFTU2VxA6QXH" name="scanwatch-nova-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova press photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVmCtt8AGjyFTU2VxA6QXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The ScanWatch Nova looks more naturally watch-like but can't fit much data on its tiny screen </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Withings)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I suspect a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> owners don't actually use apps all that often. They want on-wrist calling, voice commands, actionable notifications, and health insights. They'd also presumably like longer battery life than the 1–2 days they typically get!</p><p>What I think could work is an actual hybrid <em>version</em> of Wear OS, the same way Google made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">kid-friendly Wear OS for Galaxy Watches</a>. It could have a limited number of core Google apps and major third-party options — such as Gemini, Google Maps, Wallet, Messages, and music apps like YouTube Music and Spotify, for starters — that would each use a stripped-down UI to work on a smaller grayscale or E Ink screen.</p><p>We're getting closer and closer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini on Wear OS</a>, and I think that would be essential for an experience like this. You could tell the watch assistant to map you to a nearby coffee shop and have the next step and directional arrow pop up on a low-res screen. The same goes if you tell it to start a playlist and check the song metadata or ask it to pull up your Google Home controls; the idea is to have as little touch navigation as possible because it's harder to look through an app drawer without any color.</p>

<p>Even if we just got a fully health and fitness-focused watch like the ScanWatch 2 that sends your heart, blood oxygen, stress, ECG, and skin temperature data directly to Fitbit or Samsung Health, I bet a lot of people would buy into that option and eschew the extra Google smarts that burn through battery life.</p><p>Of course, Google and Samsung already make long-lived watches, but they're sporty, cheap squircles like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-tracker-finally-comes-to-us">Galaxy Fit 3</a> or the old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a>. They have their place for budget hunters, but there's no reason why we can't get the Fit 3's tech inside a steel watch with some actual class, even if it costs much more.</p><p>And that brings me to my other point about these hybrids: I don't want Samsung and Google designing them! Fossil had the expertise to create beautiful smartwatches and was only held back by the software. Google and Samsung have software expertise in abundance, but they need outside help on the physical side.</p><p>Just like Meta put its smart glasses tech inside of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Bans</a>, and soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakleys</a>, Google and Samsung could employ the help of well-known luxury watch brands to launch their simplified version of Wear OS Think Rolex, Cartier, Omega, Patek Philippe, and so on! Heck, if Ultrahuman can sell a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-rare-luxury-smart-ring-with-premium-materials-massive-price">$1,500 luxury smart ring</a> in department stores, you'd think Samsung and Google could pull it off!</p><p>We've already seen luxury Wear OS watches from Tag Heuer, Montblanc, and (obviously) Fossil, but all with AMOLED displays that could only look like pale imitations of watch faces to their discerning customers — plus a lack of experience with software updates.</p><p>If it's Samsung (or Google) building the software experience, then we'll at least know these hybrid watches will get years of speedy software support instead of being immediately abandoned. And by going all-in on hybrid designs, Wear OS will be the "mature" brand for serious adults while Apple Watches remain known for their kiddy squircles.</p>

<hr>
<p>We've seen two top Android midrangers debut over the last few months, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. Now, the highly-anticipated Google Pixel 9a will soon join those midrange devices in just a few months, according to a new report. Expected to bring a refreshed design with no camera bar and the same $499 starting price tag, the Pixel 9a could be a budget alternative to the pricier aforementioned midrangers.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-release-date" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> now claims the Google Pixel 9a will debut in March, with pre-orders for the device opening on March 19. The device will start shipping and become available in stores beginning March 26. Android Headlines' report cites an anonymous source for the Pixel 9a's release date, and the publication has a track record of accuracy.</p><p>The Pixel 9a's expected March release date is earlier in the year than the current Pixel 8a debuted in 2024. Google released the Google Pixel 8a in May last year, around the time of its Google I/O developer conference. However, Google also shifted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>' release date forward last year, and it makes sense for the Pixel 9a to follow suit. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O's greater focus on AI</a> rather than Android and smartphones could be another reason for the change.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9a's competitors are more expensive than the Pixel 8a was, leading some to believe that the Pixel 9a could get a price hike as well. As it turns out, the latest leaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-storage-options-leak">reports predict that is — and isn't — something to worry about</a>. The base-model Pixel 9a with 128GB of storage is rumored to cost $499, just like last year.</p><p>However, the upgraded Pixel 9a configuration with 256GB of storage will retail for $599, which is a $40 increase compared to the current model, per the report. This could be the configuration most Pixel 9a buyers go for, as there's no way to upgrade the storage after purchase and 128GB is getting thin in 2025.</p><p>If anything, this report suggests we'll learn more about the Google Pixel 9a ahead of its expected March 2025 release. Rumors and leaks typically pick up as an announcement date gets closer, before the eventual official reveal.</p>

<ul><li>Google has posted its Lunar New Year Doodle, which celebrates the Year of the Snake.</li><li>The company provided a brief story about the Year of the Snake, saying this is the time for people to venture into "growth, creativity, and transformation."</li><li>South Korea is also celebrating its Lunar New Year, which is known as Seollal.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Happy Lunar New Year; Google is highlighting its latest Doodle as we ring in another year.</p><p>The company has published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doodles.google/doodle/lunar-new-year-2025/">Year of the Snake Doodle</a> page to celebrate the Lunar New Year and festivities in Asia (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lunar-new-year-doodle-3520946/">Android Authority</a>). Google runs users through a brief history about the Lunar New Year and why it's been so heavily celebrated for "over 3,000 years." As always, users may be familiar with the bright, passionate red that the Lunar New Year brings.</p><p>The company states that residents often clean their homes before adding touches of red. This color typically symbolizes good fortune and prosperity.</p><p>Moreover, the Lunar New Year is a time for friends and family to gather over a wonderful feast. Google says the celebrations often feature "traditional favorites" like fish, chicken, dumplings, mandarin oranges, and other mouth-watering goodness. Also, stepping into Chinese mythology, the New Year is often rife with fireworks and firecrackers, but it's more than just a loud hoorah into 2025.</p><p>The brief story glances over the mythology of Nian, a fierce beast from ancient China. It's said that the beast hated loud noises, thus the reason the Lunar New Year is packed with firey explosions in the sky of multiple colors.</p><p>We've stepped into 2025, the Year of the Snake. Those born in 1989, 2001, 2013, and 2025 all belong to the snake. If any of these years are yours, then Google says this is your time for "growth, creativity, and transformation."</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://g.co/kgs/kUuLcfb">go to google.com</a> and search for Year of the Snake to enjoy a cute retro game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.18%;"><img id="fRzYFhv6JEVqrMrHB6AUx7" name="google-doodle-year-of-the-snake-2025" alt="Google's 2025 Doodle for the Lunar New Year is an orange, yellow, and pink spectacle for the Year of the Snake." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fRzYFhv6JEVqrMrHB6AUx7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="448" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, those in South Korea are also celebrating a Lunar New Year. So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doodles.google/doodle/lunar-new-year-2025-south-korea/">Happy Seollal</a> to everyone in South Korea or who celebrate this time of year, as well.</p><p>Google is pretty quiet right now in terms of reveals, but it is busy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">developing the next major OS</a>: Android 16. The company recently dropped its first beta for interested testers with Pixel phones. Users can enroll to begin sifting through what's new and what's still planned for release.</p><p>The first beta introduced "Live Updates" to Pixels alongside some interesting video recording updates for Android.</p><p>Elsewhere, it seems that we could expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">some form of Qi2</a> to arrive on Google's future Pixel devices in 2025. The WPC (World Power Consortium) posted the details of its simpler "Qi2 Ready" method for Android devices this year. Phones that are Qi2 Ready will support the necessary tech <em>inside </em>for wireless charging with support for external accessories outside the phone. Google stated that it would join Samsung is delivering Qi2 Ready devices, but it might look a little different.</p><p>The company didn't <em>commit </em>to Qi2. What it said was that it would further the standard and help progress the next version, known as Qi v2.2.</p>

<hr>
<p>Right before the Galaxy S25 lands in consumer hands, Samsung has reportedly dropped a new accessory you might not want to miss.</p><p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/magnetic-wallet-gp-tou024sagbw/">now listed</a> its official Magnetic Wallet accessory for the Galaxy S25 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/29/samsung-launches-30-magnetic-wallet-for-galaxy-s25-ships-before-the-required-cases/#more-659267">9to5Google</a>). The product features the Qi2 connection ring at the top portion of the accessory and only comes in black. Samsung's store listing states users can purchase the Magnetic Wallet at a discounted price of $14.99.</p><p>The publication claims the accessory will "generally" go for $29.99.</p><p>The user-facing part of the wallet is where you'll store your important cards and other necessities when traveling.</p><p>It's unclear when Samsung will begin taking orders/shipping the Magnetic Case. The company displays the expected price, but there's only a "Notify Me" button available, instead of one to purchase. However, the publication claims that Samsung is "shipping this wallet now" and that it should arrive once consumers' pre-ordered Galaxy S25s reach home.</p><p>Regardless, users should sign up for email notifications so you're in the loop about this attachment.</p>

<p>Samsung officially stepped into the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">the Qi2 standard earlier in January</a>, a few weeks ahead of the Galaxy S25's reveal. The company confirmed via a press release that its Galaxy devices in 2025 will come with Qi2 support. Joining the WPC's (World Power Consortium) standard for Android brings 15W wireless charging and magnetic alignment to Samsung's phones.</p><p>While Android OEMs have struggled to adopt Qi2 properly, the WPC brought about a new branding called "Qi2 Ready." Essentially, devices that are Qi2 Ready will feature the required tech inside for wireless charging alongside support for external magnetic connections on the outside for accessories.</p><p>The WPC states that it's ready for an "acceleration in Android devices with Qi2 built in during 2025." Samsung will be accompanied by Google in producing Qi2 Ready devices this year. Google is going to go about bringing this support in its own way, so we'll have to see what happens.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 series on the way (if you pre-ordered), users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">can begin looking</a> for some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">the best cases</a> to protect their new tech-baby.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Google announced that it would be taking steps to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on Google Maps in the U.S. on its Google Maps platform.</p><p>For people in Mexico, the name will stay the same; however, for the US, it will be renamed as above.</p><p>“We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google">Google</a> in a post on X. This change comes after Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20, keeping a part of his campaign promise.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps.

<p>As directed by the President, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially be known as the Gulf of America, and North America's highest peak will once again bear the name Mount McKinley," Trump's Interior Department said in a statement last week (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/google-maps-rename-gulf-mexico-gulf-america-us-users-2025-01-27/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>).</p><p>In the same X post, the tech giant said that once the Geographic Names Information System(GNIS) is updated, Google Maps will also reflect the name changes. GNIS maintains working relationships with the federal authorities and the government to "standardize geographic names for Federal use."</p><p>Google added that when there are varied names for the same place, the people residing in the local area will see the name designated to that country, while the rest of the world will see both options.</p><p>The company also said Maps will rename Denali back to Mount McKinley, which was changed during Barak Obama's presidency, paying tribute to the Alaskan natives.</p><p>It remains unknown when these changes will start showing up on Google Maps, as the company didn't give us the exact date that this will go into effect. Android Central has reached out to Google in this regard and will update the article when we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>Ahead of the March 4 Nothing event, a new leak reveals the specs of the Phone 3a.</li><li>The Phone 3a is expected to feature a 6.8-inch AMOLED 120Hz display.</li><li>The device with triple cameras is also hinted to have a glyph interface surrounding the lenses, which include two 50MP lenses and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing recently announced that a new hardware launch is happening this March, although the company directly didn’t confirm what product it is. The teasers hint at a phone launch, likely the Phone 3 or the Phone 3a. New evidence, however, points us to seeing the Phone 3a launch.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a specs have surfaced online, indicating what to expect from the company’s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android handset</a>. The leak comes from X user @gadget_bits (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/28/nothing-phone-3a-specs-leak/">Gizmochina</a>). The device is likely to bear the A059 model number and be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> SoC—the same chipset that powered the recent Redmi Note 14 Pro.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 ExclusiveNothing Phone (3a)Model number A059- Snapdragon 7s Gen 3- 6.8" FHD+ AMOLED 120hz display - 50mp +50mp 2x telephoto +8mp UW- 32mp front- 5000mAh battery- 45W fast charging- NFC, Glyph lights- Nothing OS 3.1 based on Android 15Worldwide launch on March 4 pic.twitter.com/1ixtDGmGzl<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884176023409004752">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The upcoming Phone 3a is also expected to feature a 6.8-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-or-phone-3a-could-be-coming-on-march-4">recent launch teaser</a> reveals a triple camera visor accompanied by a new glyph interface. The cameras, per the leak, indicate a 50MP primary sensor next to another 50MP telephoto sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens.</p><p>For selfies, however, we can expect a 32MP camera.</p><p>Other (rumored) key specs for the Phone 3a include a 5000mAh battery capacity and 45W fast charging support. NFC, alongside the Glyph interface on the back, is also expected. The device will likely ship with Android 15-based Nothing OS 3.1 out of the box.</p>
<p>While the leak indicates that it could be a solid mid-range phone on paper, Nothing’s signature design elements are likely to add more value and variety to the segment. We expect more details to pop up right ahead of the March 4 launch event, and we also anticipate Nothing’s sub-brand CMF’s products to showcase alongside the Phone 3a — considering the company following last year’s launch pattern.</p><p>Nothing launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> next to a couple of CMF products around the same time last year — right around the Mobile World Congress event.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want an easy plug-and-play solution for accessing streaming services; you'd rather have a lightweight, portable TV option than cable boxes, gaming consoles, or other media devices; you're already a user of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> within the Amazon ecosystem.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-new-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced">Fire TV Stick that can stream in 4K</a>; you want the latest in Amazon's AI tech.</p><p>The great thing about Amazon's lineup of Fire TV Sticks is that they're simple to use. Owners just plug the HDMI receiver into their TV and into a wall charger with a micro-USB port, both included, and they're ready to watch. The Fire TV Stick Lite is no different, ringing in at Amazon's most budget-friendly price—and even more so with this discount.</p><p>The Fire TV Stick Lite and base-level Fire TV Stick both offer 1080p resolution, so those wanting 4K will need to upgrade to Amazon's three other options: the Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Stick 4K Max, or Fire TV Cube. Additionally, the 4K lineup also includes Amazon's generative AI-powered FireTV experience, but really the Fire TV Stick Lite gets the job done.</p><p>The main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-vs-fire-tv-stick-lite">difference between the regular Amazon Fire TV Stick and the TV Stick Lite </a>is that this version isn't capable of controlling power or volume on other TVs, soundbars, or receivers, and that the non-lite version normally retails for $40 rather than $30. Otherwise, they're pretty much identical, so it might be worth jumping on this 40% off deal while it's available if external device control isn't a dealbreaker for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's new mid-range phone's launch looks like it's just around the corner. A recent Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group) certification revealed that a device with model number "<strong>SM-A566B_DS</strong>,"<strong> </strong>aka Samsung Galaxy A56 5G, was sent in for a Bluetooth Qualification Process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-bluetooth-sig-certification/" target="_blank">Smartprice</a>). This hints that the phone is set for release at the end of Q1, which seems similar to the Galaxy A55 model that was released in March last year.</p><p>While we have little to no information on the specs of the device so far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a56-13603.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a> gave us a full "unofficial" spec sheet of the phone based on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/fcc_docs_confirm_that_the_samsung_galaxy_a56_will_support_45w_charging-news-66269.php">FCC document</a>. According to the publication, the device is said to have a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, a tad larger than its predecessor, with a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+ with a brightness of 1000 nits. The screen will be protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus Plus and have an always-on display.</p><p>In November last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a56-renders-leak">full renders of the phone</a> were shown off by prominent tipster @Onleaks. The phone looked a lot like its predecessor in the images, featuring flat edges and rounded corners.</p><p>GSMArena's listing states that the device will retain the same camera specs as its predecessor, i.e., a 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide camera along with a 5MP macro camera that is said to be stacked vertically. The phone will also have a 12MP selfie camera. These cameras are said to support 4K video recording at 30fps and 1080p 30/60fps.</p>

<p>While there were rumors last year about the device's charging speed, now, FCC documents retrieved by the publication all but confirm that the device will feature 45W wired fast charging just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> (and notably faster than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a>). The publication also states that the model is expected to be powered by the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/exynos_1580_unveiled_with_cortexa720_cores_double_the_gpu_hardware-news-65051.php">Exynos 1580</a> chipset and a 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>Two leaks suggest that it could come with the new One UI 7, indicating that the device could come packed with more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which will be supported by Android 15 right out of the box. The publication further adds that the phone will come in Black and other colorways with  8/12GB RAM and 256GB storage.</p><p>However, since these are still leaks and speculations, they have to be taken with a grain of salt as we are yet to receive official confirmation from Samsung on the specs of the device. That said, it may not be long before the phone is officially unveiled.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's app store is encountering an issue on Android devices that's hampering user experiences.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/google-play-store-stopping/">9to5Google</a>, the publication reports that the Google Play Store is encountering an annoying wave of crashes on Android. The crash doesn't appear to have vastly negative effects on the system's overall software (like a lockout/system freeze). What's been reported is an app error message, which states the following: "Google Play Store keeps stopping."</p><p>Anyone who's experienced an app crash on their Android device will recognize this quick message. Users are left with no choice but to close the app and re-open it in hopes that it doesn't become too frequent.</p><p>Google has yet to formally acknowledge these issues, likely because it's not affecting a <em>vast </em>majority of its users — not yet, anyway.</p><p>The post adds that the crash has happened on smartphones and tablets, such as the Pixel Tablet. The publication also reports that it's encountered the Play Store's crash "several times" in the "past 24 hours."</p><p>At the time of writing, we've not encountered an app error with the Play Store in testing via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus 2023</a> or a base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motor Razr 2023</a>. Fortunately, the crashes don't impact the core functions of the store like downloading/installing. For now, if this is happening you and your device, waiting for a backend fix is likely your next course of action.</p><p>The Play Store hasn't had any <em>major </em>updates recently, aside from Google's introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-verified-marks-vpn-security-announcement">Verified badges</a> for "trusted" VPNs. The company detailed in a press release yesterday (Jan 28) that these badges are for companies with VPNs that have undergone an independent security review alongside displaying a committment to securing a user's data safely. These badges are arriving first for NordVPN, hide.me, and Aloha.</p><p>Others can begin taking the necessary steps for such verification.</p><p>Also, toward the end of last year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ditches-share-apps-nearby-share-play-store">ditched the "Share Apps"</a> feature from the Play Store. The function worked thanks to Android's Nearby Share protocol, which lets users send an app over the air to a friend or family member's device for download. With it gone, we're back to sharing links — which isn't too bad.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has an interesting promotional offer in the U.K. for Galaxy S25 series buyers.</li><li>The company is offering a free "starter kit" with the purchase of a Galaxy S25 device in the region.</li><li>It includes a free case and charger, but users should submit a review of the device after the proposed return period to receive the gift.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s latest Galaxy S25 series is now available for preorder across several regions after a successful launch last week. The company is also offering a free starter kit in select countries, which includes a Samsung official case and a charger worth £128.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/27/samsung-giving-away-official-galaxy-s25-case-in-uk/#more-659081">9to5Google</a>, the current offer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/?utm_source=Andrew+Romero&utm_medium=narrativ&utm_campaign=ju8olliq7vq8u&cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv-000-042720-000000-Andrew+Romero-ouefk6c5qi27z&nrtv_as_src=1&nrtv_cid=ouefk6c5qi27z&offerCID=reserve&btn_ref=srctok-f2b401cf4af586b0">available</a> in the U.K. region and is valid for the purchase of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Users would need to preorder either of the devices only through the Samsung U.K. website from January 22 to February 6.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="gbGJePPc2UN83B3GbwgV35" name="galaxy-s25-free-starter-kit" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 launch offer kit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbGJePPc2UN83B3GbwgV35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung U.K. website)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a 14-day return window for users who select the offer, post which Samsung will send an email with a link that further redirects to a review form. Users who placed the order will have 30 days from the date of delivery (of their respective Galaxy S25 device) to review their handset using the respective link.</p><p>After they submit their reviews, users won’t immediately get a confirmation email; rather, their reviews will get validated in the next 30 days after which they will be getting the aforementioned gift which likely includes a Samsung Standing Grip case and a 15W Duo charger, according to images seen on the offer page.</p>
<p>Colorways of the respective products that are being gifted may differ from the showcased image on the offer page. Users also have to bear in mind that each order is eligible for only one gift, and the email that is being used should be the same as that being used while purchasing any of the Galaxy S25 models.</p><p>Samsung has traditionally incorporated different kinds of launch offers every year during the launch of its flagship Galaxy S series. For instance, in the U.S., there is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-club-program-for-galaxy-25-series">“New Galaxy Club” program</a> for users interested in buying the Galaxy S25 series. Users who purchase a Galaxy S25 series device are eligible to opt for this additional subscription to help them upgrade their device next year.</p><p>For instance, users who buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra or S25 Plus will need to additionally pay $8.33 a month for 12 months, after which they can opt for the successor model at a discounted price of up to 50%. The new program alongside existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">preorder deals for Galaxy S25</a> is a bonus, to say the least.</p>

<ul><li>The first update for the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 (version 3.144) is rolling out, spotted by a Reddit user.</li><li>Google hasn't announced the update or shared a changelog yet, so it’s unclear what’s new.</li><li>The update is being rolled out in stages and takes about 10 minutes to install in two parts: first downloading during use, then installing when placed in the charging case.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The first update for the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 is starting to land for users. Version 3.144 was spotted by a Reddit user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/27/pixel-buds-pro-2-first-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Unveiled with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series in August of last year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> hit the shelves by late September. The Pixel phones have received several software updates since then, but the earbuds have been left out—until now.</p><p>The first update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, spotted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds/comments/1ibusag/new_firmware_update_3144/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, bumps the firmware to version 3.144. Google hasn’t made an official announcement or shared a changelog yet, so we’re not sure what’s new.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.89%;"><img id="fg5fiHba78iduwxkVxZRQg" name="Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-update" alt="firmware update for the Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fg5fiHba78iduwxkVxZRQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="338" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: InternetForward6269 / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the update details are still under wraps, users have reported occasional disconnections in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/320560541?hl=en&msgid=320565198" target="_blank">community forum</a>. As 9to5Google pointed out, a Product Expert responded to these issues, hinting that another update was on the way.</p><p>Along with the disconnection issues, some users have run into a bit of a snag with the volume controls. Apparently, the volume rocker or slider on their phones isn’t doing the trick, and only the controls on the earbuds themselves seem to work.</p><p>Even with some ongoing issues similar to the previous model, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 still stands out as a top choice for Android users.</p><p>The update is presumably rolling out in stages, so it might not show up right away for all Pixel Buds Pro 2 users. As per 9to5, the whole process takes about 10 minutes and happens in two parts: first, the update downloads while you're using the earbuds, and then it installs once you put them back in the charging case.</p><p>To see if an update is available, go to More settings > Firmware update in the Device details/companion app.</p>

<ul><li>Eufy removed a blog post announcing Find My Device trackers from its website, suggesting it won't be making SmartTrack for Android devices.</li><li>The brand first quietly changed its target launch window from "June 2024" to "late 2024."</li><li>While some Google and Eufy pages reference the brand's Find My Device trackers, all other mentions are gone for good.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Eufy appears to have shelved plans for a Find My Device item tracker for good, as the company removed a press release announcing the SmartTrack Link and SmartTrack Card for Android from its website. The change was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/eufy-find-my-device-trackers-android-deleted/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, and appears to have occurred last month, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241129034025/https://www.eufy.com/blogs/smart-tracker/eufy-tracker-works-with-google-find-my-device" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> archive data.</p><p>Although some Eufy and Google webpages still reference the brand's to-be-released Find My Device trackers, the removal of Eufy's main press release suggests that it no longer plans to release the previously-announced devices. Originally intended as new additions to Eufy's popular SmartTrack lineup of personal item trackers, the SmartTrack Link for Android and SmartTrack Card for Android never saw the light of day. Eufy was one of five <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> partners Google announced with the network last year, joined by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-joins-google-find-my-device-tracker-debut">Chipolo</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-clip-review">Pebblebee</a>, Jio, and Motorola.</p><p>When the Find My Device-compatible variants of the Eufy SmartLink trackers were revealed in April 2024, Eufy planned to launch them in June 2024. Then, when the brand that target missed, the blog post's wording was changed to say that the trackers were coming in "late 2024."</p><p>Sometime in December 2024, the blog post was taken down from Eufy's website. The original link now redirects to Eufy's homepage. Although at least one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.eufy.com/s/article/What-should-I-do-if-I-cannot-find-my-phone-using-my-SmartTrack-Card-Link" target="_blank">support document</a> acknowledging the Find My Device network remains, the removal of the blog post suggests the SmartTrack Link for Android and SmartTrack Card for Android won't ever ship.</p>

<p>Eufy hasn't publicly commented on the state of its SmartTrack Link for Android and SmartTrack Card for Android trackers since they were announced. Despite quietly changing the trackers' launch window on the blog post and subsequently removing it entirely, Eufy didn't provide any updates.</p><p>The uncertainty regarding Eufy's planned item trackers continue the underwhelming nature of Google's Find My Device launch. There are limited products available, and our own testing revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">it could take days for lost Find My Device trackers to have their location updated on the network</a>. For now, it appears Eufy is canning plans to expand the market for Find My Device trackers with SmartTrack for Android devices.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung&apos;s new flagship lineup finally hits stores next week, which means you&apos;re almost out of time to take advantage of all the great Galaxy S25 preorder deals. I&apos;ve been monitoring these offers since preorders went live last week, and I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s938uakexaa/"><strong>buying the Galaxy S25 Ultra directly through Samsung</strong></a> might be the best move for most folks. Of course, the deals on display may not be for everyone, so let&apos;s break down the pros and cons of preordering through Samsung. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="aa3b314e-c89e-46e7-be9c-0de379f06877" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,419.99" data-dimension48="$1,419.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s938uakexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="GMZqerzX5D6mz2BTFZAX4b" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in Titanium Jadegreen official render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GMZqerzX5D6mz2BTFZAX4b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="556" height="556" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 512GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s938uakexaa/" data-dimension112="aa3b314e-c89e-46e7-be9c-0de379f06877" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,419.99" data-dimension48="$1,419.99"><del>$1,419.99</del> <strong>$1,299.99, plus up to $900 of trade-in credit and more at Samsung</strong></a></p>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a super-powered smartphone with a glorious 6.9-inch QHD+ display, custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and some of the most groundbreaking AI features found on any Android phone to date. </p>
<p>Preordering the Galaxy S25 Ultra through Samsung guarantees you up to $900 off when you trade in an old or broken device, plus you'll get a free storage upgrade, some additional Samsung credit, and more.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s938uakexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="aa3b314e-c89e-46e7-be9c-0de379f06877" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,419.99" data-dimension48="$1,419.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<h2 id="reason-1-the-trade-in-credit-2">Reason #1: The trade-in credit</h2>
<p>Samsung is offering up to $900 of trade-in credit when you preorder the Galaxy S25 Ultra through the official site, and it&apos;s being pretty generous with the devices it accepts. Both the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Z Fold 5 will get you the full discount, while slightly older phones like the Galaxy S23 Plus and even the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra will land you $600 of credit to apply to your purchase. </p><p>Sure, some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25 preorder deals</a> may offer a bigger trade-in discount, but they&apos;re typically coming from phone companies that require you to add a line to your wireless service. That may work for some folks, but if you want a simple, no-strings discount, Samsung has those other retailers beat. Play your cards right and you could get this premium smartphone for as little as $399.99. </p>

<h2 id="reason-2-the-free-stuff-2">Reason #2: The free stuff</h2>
<p>Preordering the Galaxy S25 Ultra directly from Samsung gets you a free storage boost at no additional cost. That means that you could get the 512GB phone for the price of the 256GB model, or 1TB of storage for the price of the 512GB. You&apos;ll also get a free Samsung credit worth up to $110 (depending on whether or not you signed up for the Galaxy Reserve program before preorders went live). </p><p>This bit of cash can be used at Samsung.com to buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">Galaxy S25 Ultra cases</a> and other cool accessories, and it&apos;s just automatically added to your purchase with zero hassle. If you buy the 256GB version of the phone, you&apos;ll also be eligible to get a free pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> earbuds (usually $249.99) when you bundle, but more on that below. </p><p>As if those rewards weren&apos;t enough, Samsung will also hook you up with three free months of Peacock Premium and SiriusXM streaming, plus two months of Adobe Lightroom. </p><p><strong>Bonus: </strong>this isn&apos;t exactly a free thing, but it&apos;s worth mentioning that buying through Samsung is also the only way to get access to the exclusive Titanium color variants. </p>
<h2 id="reason-3-the-bundles-2">Reason #3: The bundles</h2>
<p>If you were hoping to get a few Galaxy devices in one fell swoop, Samsung&apos;s preorder deals should not be missed. In the market for a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-how-we-test">Android smartwatch</a>? Add the Galaxy Watch 7 or Galaxy Watch Ultra to your preorder and you&apos;ll get a 61% or 69% discount, respectively, when you buy the 512GB phone. </p><p>Like I mentioned above, preordering the 256GB device will get you a free pair of Samsung earbuds, but you can also get up to 92% off the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro if you opt for a different storage configuration. The exact discounts will always depend on the amount of storage you buy, so play around with the different options to find the deal that works for you. </p>

<h2 id="on-the-other-hand-2">On the other hand..</h2>
<p>I would only recommend buying the Galaxy S25 Ultra through Samsung if you&apos;re prepared to do a trade-in. If you simply want to buy the phone unlocked, skip Samsung and check out the preorder deals from Amazon or Best Buy (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-256gb-titanium-black-verizon/6612779.p"><strong>where you can get a free $200 gift card</strong></a>).</p><p>It&apos;s also worth checking with your wireless carrier to see if they can get you a better deal. Preordering through Verizon, for instance, could save you some serious cash, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/the-best-atandt-deals-of-month-year-up-to-dollar1000-off-galaxy-s24-ultra-free-flagships-and-more">AT&T&apos;s deals</a> might even get you the phone for free with an eligible trade-in and new line. </p><p>Buying a new phone can be a tricky business, and with the Galaxy S25 Ultra&apos;s steep price tag, it&apos;s reasonable to be a little cautious. My advice would be to look around before you commit to a single deal, but if you&apos;re planning to ditch an old device, Samsung deserves a closer look than most. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung has reportedly removed all references to a Bluetooth S Pen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra following user confusion.</li><li>The company previously stated one was available and "sold separately;" however, that was not the case.</li><li>Samsung likely removed the Air Controls of its S Pen in 2025 after it stated less than 1% of its users with the S24 Ultra actually used them.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is doing a bit of damage control as its official news channels retract a previous S Pen statement.</p><p>After some conflicting information, Samsung has reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insights.samsung.com/2025/01/24/how-to-boost-productivity-with-the-s-pen-on-your-galaxy-s25-ultra/">removed</a> its false Bluetooth S Pen feature section from a blog post (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-bluetooth-s-pen-post-deleted/">9to5Google</a>). As reiterated by the publication, Samsung's Insight post originally detailed a seventh "How to boost productivity" bullet point. This point highlighted the ability for users to utilize "Set Guestures" via a "Bluetooth-enabled S Pen," which was supposedly "sold separately."</p><p>The company's post explained that users could "press the button" on the side of the stylus to produce its Air Gestures. These gestures made it easy for users to prop their phone up in one place and use the pen to take photos and more.</p><p>Fast-forward to today and Samsung has removed all mentions of a Bluetooth-ready S Pen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its alleged availability for purchase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="3P2KT5JTZZXouH5Ab5Cfoj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view-close-up" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3P2KT5JTZZXouH5Ab5Cfoj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2498" height="1404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung jumped on things quickly, especially after users discovered the post and started passing it around — though, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mixed-reports-about-a-separate-bluetooth-s-pen-for-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-have-fans-puzzled">reactions were mixed</a>. What matters worse was that, despite Samsung's reference to a Bluetooth S Pen, none of its official listings showed one for sale. The company only offered up its standard S Pen and the S Pen Pro for purchase.</p><p>Then, the company's wires were crossed as an executive informed another publication that the S Pen Pro was "compatible" with the Bluetooth/Air Controls — but that proved to be false, too.</p><p>With Samsung removing any mention of this ghost Bluetooth S Pen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra with Air Control support, perhaps that's the official confirmation we need. However, considering the odd mention and the following damage control, it makes us think that maybe this <em>is </em>on the way, but it just slipped out too soon.</p><p>It's a far-out-there hope. Instead, we should take a moment and ponder: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">does it really matter</a>? It seems like Samsung's removal of the S Pen's Bluetooth functions/Air Controls is a product of its cost-cutting procedures. A little less tech, a little less money to sink into things. Moreover, the company explained that less than 1% of its users <em>actually </em>used its Air Control features via the old S Pen. Android Central's Andrew Myrick did the math and that comes out to about 158,000 users with the Galaxy S24 Ultra that utilized the S Pen's gestures.</p><p>It's a shocking number considering Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1874802229586366801">sold 15.8 million</a> Galaxy S24 Ultra units between January and November 2024.</p>

<ul><li>Honor is drawing attention to its "playful" campaign where it jabs Samsung's "lack of significant upgrades" on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>The Chinese OEM pokes fun at four areas and offers help with its camera zooming and lack of boosted power with gift boxes.</li><li>Honor's "lighthearted" campaign is likely done to spur more competition between the two OEMs as it hopes folks with buy a Magic 7 Pro, instead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor is running a new campaign as it seeks to push the envelope for how its recent flagship phone may "edge out" Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>According to Honor, the new campaign is designed to give Samsung "a little help" with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> to bring it up to par. The Chinese OEM states this "humorous" campaign, called "Happy 25th Sam," offers a few gift boxes that its competition might need to keep up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>. Honor jabs Samsung, stating it needs help in the power department; so, it's first gift is a power bank.</p><p>The press release highlights the Magic 7 Pro's 100W wired SuperCharge and 80W wireless charging capabilities for its 5,850mAh silicon-carbon battery (in China).</p><p>Another gift box is packed with a camera, equipped with a lens of a substantial focal length. Honor pokes fun at Samsung's recent Galaxy S25 Ultra zooming capabilities with this lens, comparing it to the Magic 7 Pro with AI Super Zoom. This feature is said to keep a high image quality over longer distance shots (over 30x). Moreover, the OEM highlights the phone's "industry-first" on-device portrait large model. This AI-backed model, dubbed AI Enhanced Portrait and Harcourt Portrait, is designed to deliver "striking details."</p><p>The post adds that users can leverage the phone's HD Super Burst and AI Motion Sensing for quicker capture.</p><p>Lastly, Honor says (lightheartedly) Samsung's methods of letting its users access apps on the Galaxy S25 Ultra aren't good enough either. It draws attention to the "Magic Portal" on the Magic 7 Pro, which lets users access "over 150+ third-party apps with a simple circle gesture."</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Honor says its jabs at Samsung are meant to be "playful" as it voices the "lack of significant upgrades" in the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The company adds that it believes that its recent flagship can "stand strong" against Samsung, furthering its interest in spurring more competition in the industry.</p><p>The Honor Magic 7 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-announced-europe">recently debuted in Europe</a>, a few days before the Galaxy Unpacked event, sporting the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. Of course, with many key upgrades over the Magic 6 Pro — and with Samsung's launch looming — Honor's device was looked at as potentially competing with the other. However, it's not like the Galaxy S25 Ultra hasn't advanced, especially when you consider its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">true AI companion</a>" hopes.</p><p>Samsung made the AI on its recent Ultra a little more personal, incorporating "enhanced recognition" via Circle to Search, massive Gemini updates, and the Now Bar/Now Brief on its lock and home screens. More importantly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">an extreme gauntlet</a> shows that Samsung has improved the battery/charging aspects of the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Though the phone sports a 5,000mAh battery with 45W charging like the S24 Ultra, the newer model went from 0% to 70% charge in 30 minutes. Additionally, the device could fully charge in just under an hour — much quicker than the S24 Ultra which went over the 60-minute mark.</p>

Meanwhile, U.S.-based PS5 owners should get ready for that jealous FOMO feeling because these kinds of limited-edition launches never seem to make it outside of Asia.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/2833736934/Pbe3CEWfm">Weibo</a> post (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/playstation-branded-fitness-tracker-3520210/">Android Authority</a>) explains that one lucky user who shares the post will be sent the box. However, it's fair to assume that Sony will also sell this limited-edition fitness tracker more widely to other Chinese fans.</p><p>We don't know how else the Sony-themed Xiaomi Smart Band 9 Pro differs from the normal version, aside from the cool watch strap; maybe it comes with unique software that pairs with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ps5-review">PS5</a> or Sony-themed watch faces.</p><p>Some Xiaomi bands get global releases and you can technically buy the Smart Band 9 Pro in the U.S. But I wouldn't hold my breath if I'm a PlayStation fan outside of China. Not just because this is a niche giveaway, but because it's an annoyingly common trend for Special Edition phones, watches, and other nerd-branded accessories to never make it to the United States, even when they should.</p>

<p>Android phones have a surprising number of limited editions. OnePlus, in particular, has targeted major nerd fandoms with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5t-star-wars-review" target="_blank">Star Wars-themed OnePlus 5T</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6-avengers-edition" target="_blank">Avengers-themed OnePlus 6</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-2-pac-man-edition" target="_blank">old-school Pac-Man fans with the Nord 2</a>.</p><p>The trend has died out somewhat in recent years. Samsung, for example, sold a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-note-10-star-wars-edition-unboxing">Galaxy Note 10 Plus Star Wars Edition</a> and a Galaxy S20 Plus BTS Edition, but nerds have been hung dry for recent generations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>. Still, Chinese brands like TECNO and POCO announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-spark-30-bumblebee-edition-hands-on">Bumblebee Edition</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">Iron Man Edition</a> of their new phones in January 2025, so the practice is alive and well.</p><p>Why do these phones rarely make it stateside? In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/forget-fe-phones-id-rather-have-more-special-edition-phones">2022 rant on limited-edition phones</a>, I explained how the few brands that can break into the Apple and Samsung-dominated U.S. tech market can't afford the licensing fees here. For whatever reason, selling an Iron Man phone in China is affordable, while it's all but impossible in the U.S.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we'd see more tech — or at least official accessories — that let your geek flag fly, whether as a gamer, comic book nerd, sci-fi fanatic, or anything else. Your typical smartwatch is much too compact to show a unique design, but an exclusive <em>strap</em> and <em>watch faces</em> — like Sony's PlayStation-themed band for Xiaomi — would easily work.</p><p>If Sony can partner with Xiaomi to make a PlayStation-themed watch band, why not Apple or Samsung? Both brands sell dozens of watch straps in different colors, but we never see anything official with that kind of brand synergy. And that same logic could apply to all manner of other major brands, with fanbases that would snap up limited-edition tech in a second.</p><p>At least you can usually find a phone case with your favorite character on it. But that never seems to apply to watch bands, and I wish that along with all the bands focused on style, athletics, or comfort, we had more bands focused on <em>fun</em>!</p><p>I don't want something too kitschy or garish, but I can imagine other nerdy logos in place of those PlayStation buttons, like the Rebel Alliance crest or Starfleet badge, that could look neat attached to your smartwatch. And if you ever needed to look more serious for an event, you could always swap out your band for a more fashionable and subtle one.</p><p>The bigger priority right now is making sure that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/does-your-fluoroelastomer-smartwatch-band-have-dangerous-compounds">your watch band isn't toxic</a>, obviously. But hey, giving us nerds more fun watch band options is a great incentive to make us throw out our old bands and try something new!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-77">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google’s Pixel 4a battery update is a disaster, causing crazy battery drain for many users.</li><li>The update also wiped older firmware, leaving no way to roll back to the previous version.</li><li>Google has acknowledged the mess and offered compensation: a free battery replacement, $50 cash, or $100 credit toward a new Pixel.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/older-pixel-4a-to-get-an-all-new-battery-performance-update">rolled out a battery update for the Pixel 4a</a>, and it’s been a bit of a disaster. A bunch of users are reporting crazy battery drain since installing it. To add insult to injury, Google wiped the older firmware as part of the update process, so there’s no official way to go back to the previous version. If you’re dealing with this mess, you’re pretty much stuck at the moment.</p><p>After discontinuing the Pixel 4a last year, Google had left the device without any software updates. But out of nowhere, about two weeks ago, the company released a surprise update meant to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tips-pixel-smartphone-battery-health">improve battery performance</a>. Part of the Pixel 4a Battery Performance Program, it was supposed to help some units last longer on a charge. Instead, it ended up making battery problems worse for a ton of users.</p><p>In other words, the update was a total flop—lots of Pixel 4a owners are now stuck with awful battery life. And if you were thinking about rolling back to an older version to fix things, Google just shut that door by pulling the download links for previous firmware.</p><p>Someone on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iajsu3/google_removed_pixel_4a_firmware_images_from/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> noticed that the only Android image you can get for the Pixel 4a is the new update that Google forced everyone to install in order to tackle unidentified battery issues (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/26/old-pixel-4a-updates/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The update might keep the Pixel 4a running, but it's essentially rendered it useless for many users.</p><p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/1i6u7h8/comment/m8fbhnf/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> reported their 4a draining from full to 2% in just five hours, despite minimal screen usage (under 20 minutes).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4a-firmware-removed-3520326/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> points out that Google rarely removes older firmware, implying a serious underlying issue with the Pixel 4a update.</p><p>Google is owning up to the battery disaster caused by the recent Pixel 4a update and is trying to make things right. The company is offering compensation to anyone impacted. To check if you’re eligible, hop over to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/workflow/15642495" target="_blank">support page</a>, type in your phone’s IMEI number, and follow the steps. You’ll get to pick between a free battery replacement, $50 cash, or a $100 credit toward a new Pixel.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is highlighting a new update for the Play Store that aims to give users insight into how "protected" their data is before downloading an app.</p><p>As detailed today (Jan 28) in a blog post, Google states the Play Store will soon display a new "Verified" badge on apps that have gone "above and beyond" in user data protection. Google states this verification will appear via a VPN badge provided to apps that have completed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa/masa-al2">MASA</a> (Mobile Application Security Assessment) validation — an independent app review process.</p><p>Furthermore, these VPNs have also followed Google's set safety and security guidelines.</p><p>There's more that apps need to do before they are granted a Verified badge and seen as "doing the most" to protect a user's data. The post says apps must have an "Organization" account type, meet the Play Store's target API level, and submit a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?sjid=11285933864377771824-NA">Data Safety section declaration</a>."</p><p>This final portion is important as Google states should be joined by two opt-in choices: an independent security review and "encryption in transit."</p>

<p>As previously stated, this Verified badge is rolling out for VPNs that are "trusted" for protecting your data. The post adds that VPNs (virtual private networks) like NordVPN, hide.me, and Aloha are among the first to have gone through the necessary hoops to demonstrate a higher level of security/safety.</p><p>NordVPN states, "We’re excited that the new ‘Verified’ badge will help users easily identify VPNs that meet high standards for security and privacy. In a market where trust is key, this badge not only provides reassurance to customers but also highlights the integrity of developers committed to delivering secure and reliable products."</p><p>Per the company, this consumer-facing badge will be displayed when viewing a VPN app's full details page, above the install button. Additionally, scrolling down to the "Data Safety" contents will show another badge, explaining that a specific app has been independently reviewed for security and safety measures.</p><p>The company has been pushing for more commitment toward user data safety and security <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tightens-rules-android-app-developers">ever since it tightened its ruleset</a>. Google started clamping down on low-quality apps in the Play Store with its late 2023 rollout of revamped Android Developer criteria. The new rules required developers to have tested their app with at least 20 users for two weeks <em>before </em>publishing it on the store.</p><p>The Play Store has also shifted gears and started focusing more on user-created reviews to see how an app is performing — and if it's meeting standards.</p>

"Despite its strong performance, it also maintains economical training costs," DeepSeek claims in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1#S6" target="_blank">white paper</a>.</p><p>The short recap is that DeepSeek's latest open-source AI model, DeepSeek V3, quickly became lauded by researchers and benchmarks. It performs comparably to the top OpenAI models publicly available, despite the fact that DeepSeek V3 is free for users to access and is supposedly cheap to train.</p><p>"Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-V3 has emerged as the strongest open-source model currently available, and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet," wrote DeepSeek researchers in the conclusion of the white paper. The company's internal findings have since been supported by independent tests, hence why the DeepSeek AI app has blown up globally.</p><p>So, why are users mass downloading DeepSeek, and why should that give you pause on Data Protection Day?</p>

<p>For starters, it's worth noting that much of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-can-save-tiktok-from-united-states-ban">fear in the U.S. about Chinese-based apps and services</a> is relatively unfounded. As an example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">TikTok stores all U.S. user data</a> in a secure Oracle cloud environment — it's not stored in China, and it's not even stored in TikTok's international servers in Virginia or Singapore.</p><p>It's the opposite with DeepSeek. To its credit, the company is being transparent about its data storage practices and privacy policy. It's all outlined on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html" target="_blank">DeepSeek website</a>, but it's not something you should be eager to agree to.</p><p>"The personal information we collect from you may be stored on a server located outside of the country where you live," the company explains. "We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China."</p><p>This is problematic due to China's Cybersecurity Law and National Intelligence Law, which require companies in China to share data with the government when requested. Being that DeepSeek AI is based in China and all user data is stored there, it is completely possible that the company could share your information with the Chinese government and other companies.</p><p>In fact, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-ai-china-privacy-data/" target="_blank">Wired</a> report found that DeepSeek AI already appears to send data to Baidu, a Chinese technology giant specializing in search, and Volces, a Chinese infrastructure company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qp68TBCXdkbxwUXJZKvSET" name="Deekseek-AI" alt="DeekSeek AI welcome page on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qp68TBCXdkbxwUXJZKvSET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, DeepSeek's ties to China are not the reason you shouldn't use the app. It's a factor, sure, but the privacy concerns are much simpler than that. You shouldn't be willing to give up the data DeepSeek admits it collects <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/data-breaches-how-protect-yourself">to any private corporation or government</a>, whether it be in the U.S., China, or any other region.</p><p>Simply put, DeepSeek collects <em>a lot</em> of data. It might know your birthday, email address, or phone number, depending on how you sign up. If you use an Apple or Google account, it collects some information from those accounts, like access tokens.</p><p>More worryingly, the company receives data that has nothing to do with DeepSeek AI. Using the information you gave DeepSeek, it tries to match its profile about you to your actions elsewhere. The official DeepSeek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> outlines everything:<br><br>"Advertisers, measurement, and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of the Service, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Service."</p><p>If that wasn't enough to spook you, DeepSeek also collects your keystroke patterns or rhythms, as well as your IP address. In other words, the company registers what you're typing, even if it's in another app or if you never enter your DeepSeek prompt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ceAoG3XT8se7J2XpBifvz3" name="DeepSeek" alt="In-hand view of DeepSeek AI Assistant running on Nubia Z70 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ceAoG3XT8se7J2XpBifvz3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To be fair, consumers don't have a ton of leverage when it comes to using products and services in the U.S. That's why many of us simply accept the terms and conditions and move on. However, on Data Protection Day, DeepSeek gives us a great example of why we shouldn't do that. You're surrendering a lot more data than you probably thought you would by downloading a top-charting AI chatbot from the App Store or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a>.</p><p>More importantly, apply scrutiny of companies' privacy policies and data collection practices to more than just DeepSeek. No matter what U.S. politicians would lead you to believe, there's plenty more to worry about than just Chinese companies. Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Apple, and many more tech companies are all collecting varying levels of data from you, and it's worth thinking about what you're willing to share to access the latest AI models.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-87">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Pro’s camera bar is reportedly peeling off, raising concerns about a possible design flaw.</li><li>Cases suggest the problem may let dust and water in, hinting at a structural weakness.</li><li>Initially quick to replace affected devices, Google’s support has since been criticized for dismissing complaints after the 90-day period.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s camera bar, first seen on the Pixel 6 series, was meant to be a standout feature. But with the Pixel 9 Pro, it seems Google might’ve missed the mark—users are reporting that the camera bar is peeling off the back of the phone.</p><p>Back in October, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1g65ybp/9_pro_camera_bar_popped_off/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> with a wonky camera bar caught everyone’s attention. The owner said the bar was coming loose from the phone’s body, which was pretty weird since they claimed it had been in a case the whole time and never took a tumble or got damaged.</p><p>This whole thing kind of screams “design flaw” or maybe a factory oopsie. Either way, it’s a reminder that even the fanciest devices can have some serious growing pains.</p><p>Now, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-pro-camera-bar-breaking-again/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> first reported, Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1ia6b3q/pixel_9_pro_camera_bar_is_separating_from_phone/" target="_blank">MohiFlaz</a> shared their frustrating experience with the Pixel 9 Pro. They went into full protective mode right away after buying the phone three months ago. They’ve been super careful with it too, with no drops or rough treatment. But despite all that TLC, the camera bar is still coming loose.</p><p>When the first incident popped up, Google was quick to send a replacement. But now, MohiFlaz is calling out Google for their less-than-stellar response this time around.</p><p>In the comments, the user didn’t hold back and vented about their experience with Google Support. As per the comment, Google Support basically shrugged them off because the phone is over 90 days old. So now they’re stuck between a rock and a hard place, probably looking at forking over some cash to get it fixed elsewhere.</p><p>In both cases, the camera bar started peeling from the top edge, opening up gaps that could let water and dust sneak in. Given how similar these cases are, it’s pretty likely Google knows about the 9 Pro’s structural issues. But despite that, the phone’s still sitting on store shelves, which makes you wonder if they’re just hoping no one notices.</p>

<p>We have reached out to Google for a statement and will update this post when we hear back.</p><p>Since Google hasn’t said much about why the camera bar is peeling off or how to stop it, it’s probably smart to play it safe. Slapping on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">best Pixel 9 Pro cases</a> might be your best move.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series didn’t take down the big players, but it did set new sales records for Google. However, the last thing Google needs now is bad press, so handling unhappy customers with care will be key.</p>

<p>Most chatbots today — like ChatGPT and Gemini — use inference models to come up with an answer, and they're trained on billions of inputs. While they excel at generalized queries, they struggle with solving complex coding and math problems, but this is slowly changing. OpenAI rolled out its o1 reasoning model at the end of last year, and it uses chain-of-thought — where it runs through multiple steps — to come up with an answer. <br><br>DeepSeek is challenging the status quo with its own solution. The DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model that's built on the V3 large language model, and what's noteworthy about it is that it is claimed to be developed at a fraction of the cost of what U.S. entities are doing. Essentially, DeepSeek says it spent under $6 million to train its model, which is ridiculous — U.S. brands invested hundreds of millions of dollars in training each model, and billions in infrastructure. <br><br>Oh, and you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.deepseek.com/">don't need to pay anything to use it</a>. It's the latter point that's causing so much consternation; to give you some context, OpenAI charges $200 a month for ChatGPT Pro, which is built on the o1 model. With DeepSeek R1, you get something that's just as good — for absolutely free. This runs counter to the fundamental ideal of Silicon Valley, where the tenet is that if there's a halfway- decent product, the main goal is to monetize it. <br></p>

<p>DeepSeek is doing things a bit differently; it open-sourced the r1, so anyone can take a look under the hood to see how it runs, or modify it as they see fit. It's no wonder, then, that DeepSeek climbed to the top of the App Store charts after just a week of availability. Its introduction had a seismic effect on the sector as a whole; the U.S. stock market lost a cumulative $1 trillion in value, with NVIDIA alone losing $589 billion in market value — the most by any organization on a single day.</p><p>Obviously, the market will correct itself, and the panic will ease as U.S. companies seek out ways to catch up — OpenAI is already touting that it will roll out "better models." But what DeepSeek exceled at doing is democratizing cutting-edge AI and making it accessible to everyone, and that alone is the biggest signal that the next big breakthrough in this category may not come from Silicon Valley after all. <br><br>While I'm not keen on generative AI, I dabble with ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude occasionally, and they clearly have their use cases. Reasoning models, however, are actually interesting; they have the ability to use logical reasoning and understand context, so if you ask a follow-up question, you get relevant answers. The best part is that all of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deepseek.chat">runs on your phone</a> — I had no issues using the AI assistant on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> and Nubia Z70 Ultra among others. <br><br>They're particularly great at solving math problems and creative thinking, and more than anything else, this is where DeepSeek's R1 fulfils its potential. And best of all, it doesn't cost you anything to use it. The breakneck pace of this industry and the staggering amounts of money being thrown at anyone building AI tech means we don't have to wait too long to witness the next big milestone.</p>

<hr>
<p>A Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek seems to be outperforming Big Tech’s models with way less money and resources, and it’s totally rattling the U.S. tech sector.</p><p>DeepSeek has sent shockwaves through global markets with its latest AI launch. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/tech-stocks-react-chinas-deepseek-sparks-us-worries-ai-race-rcna189394" target="_blank">NBC News</a>, the Nasdaq Composite dropped over 3%. The Dow managed to recover, closing up nearly 300 points after a rough start, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%.</p><p>Nvidia, a major player in AI, took a massive hit Monday, losing a staggering $593 billion in market value as tech stocks tanked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports. This was due to fears that DeepSeek has jumped ahead of the U.S. in the AI race. This marks the biggest one-day loss any company has ever seen on Wall Street.</p><p>DeepSeek isn’t holding back—the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1hqjimz/deepseek_claims_they_beat_openais_01_model_on/" target="_blank">saying</a> its AI is just as good, if not better, than the top U.S. models, all while costing way less. That bold claim has sent Nvidia and other AI chipmakers into a tailspin, with their stocks taking a serious hit.</p><p>Launched in 2023, this Hangzhou-based startup rolled out its first large language model before that year was even over.</p><p>DeepSeek started turning heads in the AI world last month after dropping a new model that it claims rivals top U.S. players like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-code-suggests-default-assistant-android">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a>, while being way more efficient with pricey Nvidia chips for training on massive datasets.</p><p>The startup’s open AI model, DeepSeek V3, is crushing it on popular benchmarks. Despite its size, it’s super efficient, breezing through tasks like coding and essay writing.</p><p>Obviously, what’s got some U.S. tech watchers nervous is how this Chinese startup has managed to keep pace with top American generative AI players while spending way less cash.</p><p>If that’s true, it makes you wonder if U.S. tech companies are blowing through cash for data centers and chips when there might be a cheaper, smarter way to keep AI moving forward.</p>

<ul><li>A widespread issue impacted most Garmin watch users on January 28 and 29, causing devices to be bricked.</li><li>The cause appears to be related to the daily satellite data packet that is pushed out to all Garmin watches that use GPS tracking.</li><li>Garmin put a red banner on their website on Tuesday officially acknowledging the issue, with a temporary fix.</li><li>On Wednesday, Garmin promised that it had resolved the issue in the backend.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Update 3 (4p PT day 2): </strong>Garmin says that "We have resolved the underlying issue causing some devices to be stuck on the startup screen or a blue triangle" on a banner located on its Garmin Support page. This is a relief to all Garmin users, but may not be much solace to those who already had to struggle through watch crashes and difficult reboot procedures over the last couple of days.</p><p>Garmin says that if you "Press and hold the power/light button on the device until the watch shuts off," turn it back on, then sync it with your Connect app or plug it into your computer's Garmin Express app, it should solve your watch's issue and replace the malicious file that caused this issue.</p><p>If this still doesn't work, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=IWfNuaG0jn6d6oQ4HCVz29">this Support page</a> has step-by-step instructions for each type of Garmin watch, while acknowledging that you'll lose the data that wasn't already synced to your device due to the forced reset.</p><p>Even if your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> hasn't crashed yet, I urge you to sync your Garmin watch in the Connect app by tapping the blue circular-arrow icon next to the watch icon in the top-right corner. This will ensure your watch doesn't retain the old file. Either that or you can go into your watch settings and disable GPS for a workout profile. But ideally, this Garmin backend fix has ensured that this is no longer necessary!</p><p>I myself am thinking about unboxing and setting up my new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-instinct-3-went-amoled-sort-of-heres-every-new-trick-and-tool">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, now that the crisis is finally winding down.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2 (10a PT day 2): </strong>Now the<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/status/">Garmin Connect System Status</a> shows a "Limited" status next to Activity Uploads, as it appears that Garmin watch owners are still bricking their devices whenever they attempt to start an activity.</p><p>It's been over a day since the problems began, and both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/">Garmin subreddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/">Garmin forums</a> are chock-full of complaints about the fiasco and Garmin Support's slow response.</p><p>Many users are now able to perform activities, but tread cautiously, as it's sometimes unclear whether or not your watch has replaced the satellite file responsible for this fiasco or not; definitely make sure to sync your watch with Garmin Connect manually, which should hopefully refresh the file with the latest version.</p><p>We've also found that users who manage to escape the blue-triangle bootloop, whether by hard-resetting it with the steps below or connecting it to Garmin Express on their computer, will still find persistent issues like missing workouts, gaps in their training plans, lost Body Battery or Daily Readiness data, and so on.</p><p>It might be best to avoid workouts entirely, or pull one of your old Garmin watches out of your closet and use that until everything has resolved itself.</p><p><strong>Update 1 (6:00p PT day 1): </strong>The<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/status/">Garmin Connect System Status</a> now shows "Online" status across the board; it previously said that Activity Uploads were down. However, some users are still reporting serious issues if they attempt to start an activity.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-watches-are-crashing-when-trying-to-start-gps.html">DC Rainmaker</a> has reported that the issue stems from a bad "satellite pre-cache file" wreaking havoc on watches. If your watch is synced with Garmin Connect, it should now have access to the proper file, in theory, preventing any further issues. But this won't help if your watch is already stuck in the bootloop.</p><p>The recommendation is still to hold down your watch's Light or Power button for up to 30 seconds to turn it off, then turn it back on and see if the problem is resolved. If this doesn't work, reset it again, then hold down both the START/STOP and BACK buttons while it's off; then press the Light button briefly to turn it on while still holding down the other two buttons. You'll hear two beeps; release the Start button after the first beep, then the back button after the second beep. This should theoretically free your Garmin watch from its endless loop (<em>source: </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=FMYxESEmhz9PKH0L1nMI97">Garmin Support</a>).</p><p>If your problem persists, you should get in contact with Garmin Support or use the Garmin Forums for more step-by-step guidance. And if you haven't experienced the blue triangle yourself, our recommendation is to wait to do any activities on your Garmin watch until you're sure the problem is resolved.</p><p><em>The original article is below:</em></p><p>Garmin watch users had a rough Tuesday morning dealing with their wearables, as most of them were in a frozen state.</p><p>Several users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1ibz59m/have_a_useless_watch_now/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/live/garmin-down-reports-surface-of-many-garmin-watches-crashing-are-you-affected">Reddit</a> to report that their Garmin watches have become practically useless and stuck on the boot screen.

However, Connect Garmin's Status <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/status/">website</a> indicated that Activity Uploads are down, with the warning "We are aware of an issue causing some devices to be stuck on the start up screen or a blue triangle."</p>

<p>"Just sharing - my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/garmin-forerunner-255s-music">Garmin Forerunner 255 Music</a> was faced with the infinity loop issue currently ongoing. No particular trigger, the one moment I received a Teams message, the other it was black-screen and rebooting. Happened at precisely 12 (midday)," a user told TechRadar in an email.</p><p>Reddit users have come up with their workaround of a hard reset even before the company addressed the issue. This even caused some users to lose their data on the device.

To resolve this, press and hold the power button until the device turns off, then power it back on, and sync with the Garmin Connect app or Garmin Express."</p><p>Garmin links users to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IWfNuaG0jn6d6oQ4HCVz29">"My Garmin Device Will Not Boot" page</a> if the steps above don't work. There, it reiterates that you should try holding down the power button for 15 seconds, but that if it doesn't solve the problem, "you will need to complete a factory reset," which will remove certain features like Garmin Wallet and your settings temporarily. All of your health and fitness data (prior to the crash) should be preserved, as long as you synced your watch to the Connect app recently.</p><p>However, we'd recommend you hold off on a factory reset until it's a last resort. It's possible that this issue will persist until Garmin resolves the problem on <em>its</em> side, which would mean a factory reset won't solve your problem.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-102">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Nothing has a new event geared up for March 4 — right around MWC.</li><li>The launch teaser hints at a new hardware launch that will include glyph interfaces.</li><li>It is still unclear what to expect from the launch event, but it is expected to be either Phone 3 or Phone 3a, and also a bunch of audio products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The anticipation around Phone 3 keeps building up, and Nothing is now having a hardware launch slated this March as the company just teased. However, it is still unclear what the product is, but it surely looks like a phone launch.</p><p>According to the latest teaser, a new phone launch is likely scheduled for March 4 at 10 a.m. GMT. Like the signature Nothing products, the upcoming device will also have a glyph interface, likely right around the camera visor.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/9MmuzleJai<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884210887025959065">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While the Phone 3 from Nothing is long overdue, as its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> came back in 2023, it still needs to be determined what we will see at the March event. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/27/nothing-phone-3-march-launch-date-teaser/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, however, it could be Phone 3a rather than the flagship Phone 3, per a recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/12ushabh/status/1883904862020338059">spotted e-commerce listing</a>.</p><p>A Flipkart e-commerce listing (now removed) teaser of the upcoming event has indicated that it is indeed a Phone 3a launch and not the Phone 3 itself. The launch time also hints at the same, as it just falls around the Mobile World Congress event happening from March 3-6 in Barcelona. For the uninitiated, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> was released during the same event last year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WIP 📱 pic.twitter.com/L3c5K356W0<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1882369936183665088">January 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Nothing has also shared some sketches of the upcoming product that the company is currently working on. There are a bunch of sketches, which don’t precisely reveal the product and it’s also a wild guess whether it is Phone 3 or the Phone 3a or whether it is a phone after all.</p><p>At a glance though, they appear to be sketches of a phone internal or probably some of the glyph interface we might probably get to see after the product launch.</p><p>Lastly, alongside the Phone 2a launch last year, the company’s sub-brand had also released CMF Buds and Neckband. The teaser could also mean that we might also see their successors with the hint of glyph interface integration for the first time on the company’s affordable range, which is a wild guess and to be taken into consideration with a grain of salt.</p>

The Bluetooth speaker is available in vibrant colors, and a big part of its allure is the 30W sound it is able to produce. Combine that with IP67 ingress protection, and you get a speaker that nails the basics. <br><br>As is often the case with Xiaomi's audio products, affordability is a key selling point of the Sound Outdoor. The speaker was introduced in China back in May 2024, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/mi-sound-outdoor-30w-ip67-upto-12-hours-playback-30-w-bluetooth-speaker/p/itm17099bbcfdd72">costs ₹3,999 ($46) in India</a>; a great value when you consider the feature-set. You can also pick it up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Portable-Bluetooth-Wireless-Waterproof/dp/B0D9ZXFX9C">on Amazon in the U.S. for $65</a>, and if you want to go the reseller route, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/i/1005006902377465.html">listed at AliExpress for $49</a>. If you want to buy it in the U.K., you'll need to shell out £35 ($44).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsEi82iWP4FWY4fEa2dUj8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsEi82iWP4FWY4fEa2dUj8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like Tribit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tribit-stormbox-2-review">StormBox 2</a> and most new products in this segment, the Sound Outdoor has a cylindrical design that makes it easy to take anywhere. There's a carrying hook at the top that allows you to dangle it from a bag, and the bright orange hue does a great job accentuating the otherwise-muted black color scheme. If you need a bit of vibrancy, the speaker is available in blue and red color variants as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9qhXjFx562ZRmFLD9zDTr8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qhXjFx562ZRmFLD9zDTr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The outer surface of the Sound Outdoor is coated in fabric with a mesh covering, and it feels great to hold. You get rubber feet on one side, and Xiaomi's logo is emblazoned at the front, but as it's in the same color as the fabric, it isn't as visible. The playback controls are mounted at the top of the Sound Outdoor, and you get volume up/down along with a multifunction button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ARfR9234WnRda6RNTb3Kd8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ARfR9234WnRda6RNTb3Kd8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back of the unit houses the power button, Bluetooth pairing mode, USB-C port (hidden behind a gasket), and a stereo pairing button. Interestingly, Xiaomi says you can connect the Sound Outdoor with 99 other speakers, creating an array totaling 100 units. But as the manufacturer sent over just the one unit for testing, I wasn't able to see if this feature is any good. Regardless, it should be good enough in stereo mode as well, so if you want a wider soundstage, picking up two of these is a good option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c5wKmMD6WFxabL5YJXqoZ8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5wKmMD6WFxabL5YJXqoZ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Either end of the Sound Outdoor has a passive radiator that does a good job creating a vibrant sound, and the speaker itself contains two driver units — a 20W woofer and a 10W tweeter. The combined 30W sound is among the best in this category, and it does a decent enough job in this regard.</p>

<p>Xiaomi's audio gear has a characteristic sound with a bass-heavy sound signature, and that's the case with the Sound Outdoor as well. You get a good energy in the low-end along with clear mids and recessed highs, and the overall tonality lends itself well to casual listening. As the name suggests, this speaker's main attraction is that it can be used outdoors, and in that context, I have no issues with the sound.</p>

<p>To that effect, you get IP67 dust and water resistance, making the Sound Outdoor immune to any inclement weather conditions. I used it in the shower, and the carrying hook means you can easily dangle it on a shower caddy. Coming in at 597g, it isn't too heavy either, and the easy portability combined with the powerful sound makes it a great choice for use in the home or outdoors.</p>

<p>I didn't see any issues with Bluetooth connectivity either; the speaker has Bluetooth 5.4, and I paired it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. You don't get any Bluetooth codecs outside of the standard SBC and AAC, but again, that's good enough in this category.</p>

<p>There are no problems with battery life either. The Sound Outdoor has a 2600mAh battery, and it lasted just over eight and a half hours in my testing, with the volume turned up (obviously). It charges via 15W USB PD (5W/3A), so you can use just about any charger with the speaker. However, as there's no fast charging, it takes over two and a half hours to charge the Sound Outdoor, so I'd suggest plugging it in at night.</p>

<p>If you need better sound, I highly recommend the StormBox 2 — it is my go-to portable speaker these days. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Bluetooth-Surround-Waterproof/dp/B0CW933QSJ">costlier at $69</a>, but you get a richer sound, better battery, and I like the design a little better. The StormBox 2 can also be used in stereo mode, and you get extensive customizability when it comes to the sound.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you want something that isn't as big, Xiaomi's Sound Pocket has the same design in a smaller and lighter chassis. The speaker also gets IP67 ingress protection, and while the 5W driver doesn't get anywhere as loud or detailed, it is decent enough in its own right. It also uses a cavity to create a louder sound, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooh-Resistance/dp/B0CZRLRGM5">costs $39 on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, the Sound Outdoor is another win for Xiaomi. The speaker looks good, has a great sound, and doesn't cost as much as its rivals. In short, this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">best budget Bluetooth speakers</a> you can get today.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While TerraMaster always had a good selection of budget-focused models, the brand undertook an ambitious overhaul last year in a bid to target the high-end segment. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">tested the all-flash F8 SSD Plus</a> when it debuted, and came away thinking the brand did a great job not just on the hardware side, but also the software. <br><br>With the F4-424 Max, TerraMaster is looking to continue that momentum. The 4-bay NAS has the best hardware package in its category, including two 10GbE ports, a 10-core Intel Core i5 1235U platform, 8GB of upgradeable RAM, and four traditional drive bays in addition to two M.2 slots. <br><br>Combine that with the changes to TOS 6 software, and the F4-424 Max has the potential to be one of the best 4-bay NAS models you can buy today, particularly if you're looking to build a high-end Plex server. I used the NAS for over two months, and here's why I think it is a better choice than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a>.</p>

<p>TerraMaster unveiled the F4-424 Max in Q4 2024, and the NAS is now available globally. It retails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">for $899 on Amazon</a>, and if you don't need dual 10GbE connectivity, there's a standard F4-424 with dual 2.5GbE ports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0CPP5GDZ3">that costs $499</a>. This variant is powered by the Intel N95 and shares a similar design. There's also an F4-424 Pro that has a Core i3-N305 and 16GB of memory along with dual 2.5GbE connectivity, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DDXLCLV7">that model is $649</a>.</p>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-design"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HtFwVJbGEMqsYf876PwAZU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HtFwVJbGEMqsYf876PwAZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TerraMaster's earlier offerings stood out because of their distinctive aluminum enclosures, and while the design was intriguing, they didn't have the best thermal efficiency. The brand is addressing that with the F4-424 Max by switching to a more modest aesthetic, with a black chassis that doesn't attract as much attention.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8Qvy84U34AveBCWfWFG2dU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Qvy84U34AveBCWfWFG2dU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's notable is that the sides are ventilated — similar to what you get with the DS923+ — allowing better airflow into the NAS. The server is smaller than other 4-bay NAS models I tested recently, and as is always the case with TerraMaster, you get a 120W external power brick.</p>

<p>I also like that there's now a 120mm fan at the back, and it does a fantastic job ensuring the drives don't overheat. As an added bonus, it doesn't get loud either. TerraMaster has a new design for the drive bays as well, with a push-to-latch mechanism that's easy to use. The brand finally switched to a tool-free drive installation, and this makes slotting in 3.5-inch HDDs significantly easier.</p>

<p>Outside of that, there isn't much else at the front. You get the usual status LEDs, and while most NAS models have a USB port that lets you plug in a drive, that isn't the case here — all the ports are located at the back. Interestingly, even the power button is at the back, with TerraMaster opting to go with a clean look up front that doesn't look too busy. <br><br>The changes to the design deliver meaningful benefits. The F4-424 Max has much better ventilation, and the chassis doesn't stand out quite as much, blending into the background.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ndARLRPwWhuh8wRnwmKMWU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ndARLRPwWhuh8wRnwmKMWU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the fact that you're getting two 10 Gigabit ports at the back of the NAS is the biggest differentiator, and it gives it a distinct edge — particularly when you consider that the DS923+ has dual Ethernet connectivity. You don't get the ability to add an additional port, but that shouldn't be an issue to anyone considering this NAS; with a 20Gbps addressable bandwidth, you don't have to worry about the network connection being the bottleneck.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GLwNVDPiGpr6jZ62RBaAgU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GLwNVDPiGpr6jZ62RBaAgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are two USB-A ports alongside a USB-C port, and all three get 10Gbps bandwidth. I would have liked to see the USB-C connector at the front as that makes connecting external drives easier, but other than that, I don't have any problems with the port selection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xperaV7uGCk8XJCbgbcPaU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xperaV7uGCk8XJCbgbcPaU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS comes with 8GB of DDR5 non-ECC memory pre-installed, which takes up one of the two SO-DIMM slots available. You can switch out the memory modules and increase it to 64GB (32GB in each slot) should you wish to do so. There are two M.2 Gen 4 slots available as well, and they're easily accessible by sliding the left side panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zgKtXeXfLD9fnX3ZpXBbZU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgKtXeXfLD9fnX3ZpXBbZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each drive bay accommodates 22TB NAS HDDs, so the total addressable storage is 88TB without including the M.2 bays. If you are thinking of going this route, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-Enterprise-Internal-ST22000NT001/dp/B0B94NBBJH">22TB IronWolf Pro drives</a>; I use these in my main NAS, and they're terrific.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KoaEGNupWGorxXfBfFMvXU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KoaEGNupWGorxXfBfFMvXU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Powered by Intel's 10-core Alder Lake Core i5 1235U with integrated Iris Xe, there isn't any shortage of power here. If anything, the NAS is among the best of any 4-bay server I tested, and there have been plenty of standout products over the last two years. <br><br>There are no issues in daily use, and whether it's running a VM or managing an extensive Plex library, the NAS easily breezes through demanding tasks. It has hardware transcoding and effortlessly manages to transcode 4K videos, and I didn't see any issues in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gk8QogvhZ8Lypwh65KSZaU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gk8QogvhZ8Lypwh65KSZaU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, I didn't notice any problems with file transfers, with the NAS able to saturate the bandwidth of the IronWolf drives with relative ease. You'll ideally need to use M.2 drives like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CQ2CHH">WD SN850X</a> to take full advantage of the 10GbE connectivity. <br><br>The TOS 6 software is much better than previous iterations, and you get native clients for most utilities, including media streaming, backing up data, and virtual machines. You get Docker containerization as well, so you can easily install just about any service you need if it isn't available as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WMnLg77Qpov7X38XuspMNU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WMnLg77Qpov7X38XuspMNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue in this area is that the software tends to be buggy at times, and the mobile clients aren't anywhere as polished as other brands. While there is a Photos client, it doesn't have any of the advanced features you get with DiskStation models. <br><br>It's clear that TerraMaster still has some work to do with the software, but I will admit that TOS 6 is a step forward — it delivers a cleaner interface and has much better usability. There's also the fact that if you don't like the software, you can just install TrueNAS Scale on the NAS.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-the-alternatives"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: The alternatives</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-20.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two years after its release, the DiskStation DS923+ is still a great choice due to the software feature-set. It definitely lags behind in terms of the hardware — every other NAS I tested has better connectivity — but the rock-solid software utilities combined with the robust mobile clients make the DS923+ an enticing choice, and it does a great job as a Plex server.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-should-you-buy-it"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LcxA6b5i3NqbAHpscm7ygU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LcxA6b5i3NqbAHpscm7ygU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a powerful 4-bay server</li><li>You want 10GbE connectivity as standard</li><li>You need hardware that will last a decade</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best software in this category</li><li>You need a great value</li></ul>
<p>Outside of a few software drawbacks, there isn't much to fault with the F4-424 Max. The hardware is clearly the main selling point, and the inclusion of dual 10GbE ports along with the powerful Intel chipset and upgradeable memory makes it a fantastic choice if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best Plex NAS</a>. <br><br>While the TOS 6 software is much better than previous iterations, it's still missing that final bit of polish, and if you don't like the pre-installed software, you can roll your own — and that's enticing in its own right. I'm going to install TrueNAS and write a feature talking about how it holds up against TOS 6, but the fact that you can do so is in itself a big deal. <br><br>The F4-424 Max doesn't quite have the same value-focused pricing as its predecessors, but the upgrades to the hardware and software extensibility make it a good overall choice nonetheless.</p>

<p><em><strong>A BUNCH of people have asked:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Does the Samsung Galaxy S25 support the WPC's Qi 2 specifications? Can I use MagSafe stuff with it? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Alternatively:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Why doesn't the Galaxy S25 support Qi 2 without buying a special case from Samsung?</strong></em></p>
<p>It seems like everyone wanted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> to support Qi 2 with MagSafe so they can stick their new phone to things and charge it or do whatever else someone can come up with using magnets. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">I've got good news, and I have bad news</a>.</p><p>First, I want to say that while Samsung makes some great products, the company can be terrible regarding messaging. My dad would say they could wreck a box of ball bearings.</p><p>That could be intentional, maybe to keep an air of mystery surrounding new products, or because we like to pretend leaked information will always be true.</p>
<p>In any case, the Galaxy S25 does support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/" target="_blank">Qi 2.1.0</a> (they insist the zero be added and is important) specifications, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/23254">listed</a> by the Wireless Power Consortium, which includes:</p><p><strong>1.

<p>You can use the S25 with any Qi 2.1.0 or older charger, and it will charge. It just won't stick to anything because it's not magnetic.</p><p>If you want support for the MPP you will have to buy a case that has the magnets in the right(ish) spot.</p><p>Yay, technology!</p>
<p>Why is it like this? Couldn't Samsung have just slapped the magnets inside the S25 and called it a day? This is just a scam to sell pricey Samsung cases, right?</p><p>Probably not. I'm sure Samsung is very happy to sell you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">phone accessories like cases</a>, but I think this time there is more to it all. This was the easy way to try and give everyone what they wanted without reinventing the "guts" of the current Galaxy S series.</p><p>Qi2 with the MPP is a mostly open standard (meaning any company can license it and use it to build stuff), but it is based on something Apple first started doing. It's great that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23538131/qi2-wireless-charging-apple-samsung">Apple gave something like this away,</a> and I'm not complaining, but it means the phone was designed first, and the magnetic latching system was built around it.</p><p>Engineers at Apple put magnets and a receiver coil inside the iPhone where they would fit in the correct configuration and not interfere with any other components. Everything works great because it was all designed to work together.</p>

<p>When Qi2 first came out, I predicted it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">destined to fail</a> because the magnet arrangement and power transmission were both part of the spec. It meant that if you wanted to use the Qi2 spec inside your next phone, you had to put the right magnets in the right places.</p><p>This was done so chargers would be universal; you could walk into Best Buy and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=qi+2+charger&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys">buy a Qi2 charger</a> and it would work on any phone. But it meant that most phone makers had to rework their phones so things would fit where they were required to fit. So, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a>, we never saw any flagship phones using Qi2 because no company wanted to go back to the drawing board for a phone that's been in development for several years.</p><p>Some companies will never adopt Qi2 because they have their own proprietary version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomis-new-30w-mi-charge-turbo-fastest-wireless-charging-standard-yet">fast wireless charging</a>. They might add magnets to it, but you won't be able to use their charger on any other brand of phone and get fast charging speeds. It might not work at all. A standard prevents this from happening, and they are generally a good thing.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 was reworked</a>, and the magnetic part became its own standard, it meant that companies would and could adopt better, safer charging specifications. That's a great thing — the changes you don't care about can make a big difference when it comes to efficiency and safety.</p>
<p>Did Samsung do all this on purpose to get you to buy a case? We reached out to Samsung for an official statement and asked if they could share why they chose not to include the MPP on the Galaxy S25. If and when they answer, we'll update this article and publish the statement in its entirety.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps on Android Auto now centers the navigation arrow if you haven’t set a destination yet.</li><li>However, this tweak means that much of the map view around your car will be blocked by the destination box on smaller screens.</li><li>Luckily, the update still shifts the navigation arrow and driving route when a destination is set.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> runs on car screens of many sizes, and although it tries to take a one-size-fits-all approach, that doesn’t always work. As newer cars start shipping with much larger screens with different aspect ratios, Android Auto is occasionally updated to adapt. However, that isn’t always a good thing. Now, a slight tweak to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> view in Android Auto is causing some users to become frustrated, as documented in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1i905xk/google_maps_is_now_centered_on_the_screen/?rdt=43625" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a>.</p><p>Previously, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-android-3d-building-android-auto-sync">running Google Maps on Android Auto</a> without a destination set, the street a user is currently driving on — along with their navigation arrow — would appear off-centered. It was positioned toward the right, to make room for the destination box. The destination box is fairly large, and features the search bar plus a few suggested location. Paired with the settings and buttons to the left of it, the destination box eats into the viewable area of your map.</p><p>That’s where the off-centered street view came in handy. It ensured that the street you’re driving on could be viewed on the map even on small, squarish Android Auto screens. A new OTA update appears to have shifted the navigation arrow, denoting a user’s current position on the map, to the center. This makes it tricky to see what’s in front of you on the street being traveled.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1i905xk/google_maps_is_now_centered_on_the_screen">Google Maps is now centered on the screen</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto">r/AndroidAuto</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The good news is that the Android Auto update doesn’t seem to affect the view when a destination is set. While navigation is active, the navigation arrow and driving route are both shifted right so they are clearly visible. This makes it all the more puzzling why Google would change the user-interface for setting a destination, as Reddit users describe in the comments to the original post.</p><p>The shift only affects cars with smaller and square displays, as widescreen or larger screens have the room to keep the map view visible even while centered. Hiding or minimizing the search bar and suggestions list should help matters, but that’s now another thing Google Maps users on Android Auto have to worry about.</p><p>It’s possible that Google changes or reverts this update in a future one, as it has tweaked the position of the navigation arrow and destination box multiple times in the past. For now, it seems users will have to get used to the central placement of the navigation arrow.</p>

<ul><li>Google has made the PebbleOS source code available for download and free use.</li><li>Original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky plans to launch a "new Pebble-like smartwatch" with "the same beloved features" as before.</li><li>These features include the trademark e-paper screen, long battery life, and "hackable" software for users.</li><li>Other groups, including the "Rebble" project for recreating Pebble's software, will be able to use Pebble's code for their own watches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pebble brand has been dead for nearly a decade, but Google is allowing its devoted fans and former engineers to resurrect PebbleOS by making the code open-source.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html">Google Open Source Blog</a> announced the news, sharing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google/pebble">Github repository</a> for the PebbleOS source code. Although some "proprietary source code" was removed, anyone can take the remaining code and generate a new version of PebbleOS, with functionality like "notifications, media controls, fitness tracking, and support for custom apps and watchfaces" available.</p><p>Pebble watches have a beloved cult following that has persisted well after the company's 2016 sale to Fitbit — which Google acquired (along with Pebble's IP) a few years later. Our editor Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-time-review">reviewed the Pebble Time</a> back in 2015, with a generally positive impression along with some dislikes of its unique design.</p><p>Now Pebble's former founder, Eric Migicovsky, has announced plans to bring back the Pebble brand, launching a new watch with "the same specs and features as Pebble, though with some fun new stuff as well."</p><p>On his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back">personal blog</a>, Migicovsky explains that he "asked friends at Google... if they could open source PebbleOS," and that "over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on this."</p><p>Now that PebbleOS is officially open source, Migicovsky and his "small team" can launch a Pebble clone — even if they can't <em>call</em> the watch "Pebble." Google still owns the name, after all! Considering some Pebble watch owners <em>still</em> wear these watches all these years later, they'll no doubt be eager to see how this new version stands the test of time.</p>

<p>"Lessons were learned last time," Migicovsky admits in his blog post, referring to how he oversaw Pebble's massive popularity burst on Kickstarter, the company's overambitious growth, and its failure to grow to match costs, leading to the need to sell Pebble to Fitbit.</p><p>His 2024 blog post <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/success-and-failure-at-pebble">"Success and failure at Pebble"</a> runs through where things went wrong. He highlighted things like the "too damn big" bezel on the Pebble Time and how they "failed to reposition" Pebble beyond the "hacker" crowd to productivity and fitness users. But the main issue seemed to be a simple case of spending too much money before Pebble was ready to earn enough revenue back.</p><p>With this project, it seems that the new Pebble team plans to stick to its strengths, with a geeky, niche watch that'll appeal to a core group of power users — similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing phones</a> in that space — rather than using massive resources to try and compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> or Apple Watches.</p><p>Some of the key features of this hypothetical Pebble successor are, according to Migicovsky's post, a sunlight-readable e-paper screen, long battery life, physical buttons for functions like music controls, and a "hackable" OS that lets you create your own watch faces and apps.</p><p>We're curious to see what new features this team will focus on. Health and fitness tracking are the most obvious growth areas for smartwatches these days, but that might require more resources than this small team can reasonably create.</p><p>I myself wrote last year about how I wished that a watch company would bring back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-straps-failed-for-reason-but-deserve-second-chance">Pebble smart straps</a>; that's more about hardware than source code, but given how Pebble took such a unique approach, it'll be fascinating to see what old ideas make it into the new version.</p><p>Of course, the Repebble team isn't the only group invested in reviving Pebble. There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html">Rebble community project</a>, which had been working on a RebbleOS replacement firmware and now have plans to use the PebbleOS source code within their new project.

<ul><li>OnePlus is rolling out a big update for its last-generation midranger, the OnePlus 12R.</li><li>The update includes the BeaconLink app, Touch to Share, and Android Security Bulletin patches for January 2025.</li><li>It’s starting to become available in batches for users in all markets, including India, Europe, and North America.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out a significant update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> that adds a new app, a new feature, and the January 2025 security patches, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1779149502209327113" target="_blank">post</a> on its community forum. The update, with build number OxygenOS 15.0.0.500, is now becoming available in batches in all markets, including India, Europe, and North America.</p><p>The highlight of this iteration of OxygenOS 15 is the addition of a BeaconLink app. It works like a walkie-talkie and allows to call others nearby even if they don’t have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. While other OnePlus and Oppo phones already received the feature with OxygenOS 15, the OnePlus 12R is just now gaining support. There are limitations, of course — not every device is supported and range is limited to 500m.</p><p>The OnePlus 12R receives another OxygenOS 15 favorite as part of this update, and that’s Touch to Share. It’s an AirDrop alternative for OnePlus phones that’ll make it easier to share photos, files, and more across devices. Files can be shared with Android phones, plus iPhones as well.</p>

<p>Aside from those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15 features</a>, the update includes security patches from the January 2025 revision of the Android Security Bulletin. As such, it’s recommended that OnePlus 12R users update as soon as the new version is available. OnePlus says the rollout will be limited at first, but will open up after a few days. With that in mind, you shouldn’t have to wait long for builds CPH2585_15.0.0.500 (India), CPH2609_15.0.0.500 (Europe/Global markets), or CPH2611_15.0.0.500 (North America) to appear for your device.</p><p>It’s important to note that the update is only available for OnePlus 12R phones already running OxygenOS 15. If you’re still on Android 14, you’ll first need to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based OxygenOS 15 before this patch will appear.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While I'm writing this, I've had my Galaxy S25 Ultra review unit for less than 24 hours. Much of that time has been spent getting everything set up, along with running a few benchmarks before settling in.</p><p>Once the benchmarks were completed, I started downloading and setting up apps, meaning the onslaught of notifications arrived. It wasn't long before the thought popped into my head that something about my notifications was <em>different</em>, and it wasn't just going from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Despite having notifications ping and vibrating the phone, I would pull it out of my pocket, and there would be nothing on the lock screen. It was like I was getting those annoying "phantom" notifications, but en masse.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QbYE2UUZjtyPHPJuV62skK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-lockscreen-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbYE2UUZjtyPHPJuV62skK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first thing that I checked was to see if Notification Categories was enabled. This was something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/enable-notification-categories-samsung-galaxy-s24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I noticed with the Galaxy S24</a>, but it seems that Samsung listened to feedback and now has that turned off by default. Then I figured something might have been messed up when I started trying to customize the Lock Screen settings. Nope.</p><p>As it turns out, I'm not the only one who realized that something was "off" with notifications. If he weren't a Bills fan, and we weren't hundreds of miles apart, I'd probably try to give this individual a big ole' hug. Will Sattelberg, Phones Editor for Android Police, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-one-ui-7-lock-screen-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">published a piece</a> that solved all of my problems. While catching up on my RSS feeds, I also noticed that Ben Schoon, Senior Editor at 9to5Google, also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/23/samsung-one-ui-7-lock-screen-notification-changes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ran into the same issues</a> with his Galaxy S25 Ultra review unit.</p><p>So, what's actually going on with notifications?</p><p>For some reason, Samsung decided to change the "Default Lock Screen Notification Style." Traditionally, lock screen notifications would appear as a banner, making them easily identifiable without thinking twice. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, that's no longer the case, as the default option is set to "Icons," which does nothing more than show a tiny notification before throwing the app icon into your status bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="keXMiPsvpagDqxFzRHAPK7" name="lock-screen-notification-settings-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Lock screen notification settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/keXMiPsvpagDqxFzRHAPK7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It completely removes the ability to just glance down at your phone to read the notifications before determining whether it needs immediate action. Instead, many will unbox and set up their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a>, only to potentially have the same frustrations.</p><p>However, this isn't something limited to just the Galaxy S25, as I also checked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> I have on hand that is running the One UI 7 beta. Sure enough, lock screen notifications are set to "Icons," meaning that you'll need to change this yourself if you actually want to see notifications when they arrive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wUaowjdkQWiVqCTr52WRJ7" name="lock-screen-notification-settings-s25-ultra-z-fold-6-s24-ultra" alt="Lock screen notification settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Z Fold 6, and S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUaowjdkQWiVqCTr52WRJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I understand Samsung's desire to try and clean up the lock screen in order to put more focus on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Now Bar</a>. However, it's not like you can even use the Now Bar on the lock screen to view any of your notifications. I'm not sure if this is something that Samsung is cooking up for a future One UI 7 update, but that would make a lot more sense.</p><p>Instead, relegating the app icons to the status bar just isn't the experience I would have expected. It might not be a problem if you only get a few notifications every day, but as soon as you end up with more than three or four notifications, everything breaks down.</p><p>Okay, so enough complaining. Thankfully, getting things back to "normal" is pretty easy:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Lock screen notifications</strong>.</p><p>4. Under <strong>Notification style</strong>, select <strong>Cards</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.00%;"><img id="YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg" name="how-to-change-lock-screen-notifications-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="How to change lock screen notifications on Galaxy S25 and One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that's it! Now, when notifications arrive, you'll actually be able to read them without worrying about the icons in your status bar.</p><p>It's entirely possible that Samsung will release a "day one" software patch that's available as soon as you take the S25 out of the box. But I also wouldn't be surprised if Samsung just left things as they currently are, at least for the time being. However, I do think there will be quite a few people who take to Reddit and support forums wondering how in the heck they can get their notifications back. And if there's enough pushback, then perhaps Samsung will revert the changes with One UI 7.1 or something.</p><p>What I don't understand is why Samsung decided this would be the best way to handle notifications. Again, maybe it plans to integrate notifications into the Now Bar, and even if that's the case, then it should've waited until those changes were ready for prime time. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of an uncluttered lock screen, but I don't want these kinds of decisions being made for me.</p>

<ul><li>New leaks claim to have nailed down the specifications of Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7.</li><li>The clamshell could see a dual camera array with a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10MP selfie camera.</li><li>Previous rumors have claimed the Flip 7 could get a noteworthy display increase for its internal and external screens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Now that we've wrapped up Samsung's slab phone launch, rumors are digging through the web to find some supposed foldable specs.</p><p>This time, a set of leaked Galaxy Z Flip 7 specifications were posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-7/">GalaxyClub</a> (Dutch), which purports the phone's cameras. According to the publication, a recent discovery suggests the clamshell will sport a 50MP primary lens. This is rumored to be shored up by a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, as well as a 10MP selfie camera.</p><p>The post speculates that any worthy improvements to the Flip 7's cameras could lie squarely with its software — and perhaps the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> goodies with that, but we have a few months until we know more officially.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-06.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4197" height="2361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While these are some very early Galaxy Z Flip 7 camera leaks, they don't spur excitement as the setup is the exact same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">the Flip 6</a>. The device's 50MP primary lens featured a 1.8 aperture with Dual Pixel AF, and OIS (optical image stabilization). The ultrawide camera came in with a 2.2 aperture. So, while the primary lens is a bit better at handling low-light scenarios, perhaps we're looking at the same situation with the 2025 version.</p><p>Galaxy Z Flip 7 rumors have been light, with one notable rumor arriving late last year about its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">potential display upgrade</a>. The device is rumored to grab a slightly larger 6.8-inch screen and a bigger 4-inch cover display. It goes without saying that a display that covers the Flip 7's cover — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> — would be nice, especially since Motorola's clamshell <em>has </em>a 4-inch cover screen. Samsung's 2024 model still sports the tab-like cutout for its dual camera lenses.</p><p>Elsewhere, the folks at GalaxyClub reiterated a rumor about a cheaper Galaxy Z Flip in 2025. Rumors about a cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-budget-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-tipped-to-feature-a-flagship-caliber-display">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> were made earlier in January, with speculations stating it could boast a display like the Flip 6. It also seems the device could sport the Exynos 2400e, the same chip inside the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><p>The Flip 7 alongside the Fold 7 is expected to debut later this summer (per usual) — and there might be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">a Samsung tri-fold, too</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google’s next mid-range handset is likely to launch during 2025’s IO event.</li><li>Ahead of the launch, the Pixel 9a leak indicates its storage options, which include 128GB and 256GB storage options.</li><li>It is the same as the predecessor model, the Pixel 8a, and an earlier leak also hinted at 8GB of RAM.</li><li>Another report has indicated the possible price hike of the larger storage option.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s next product launch this year could be the Pixel 9a, the mid-range phone, which is supposedly a toned version of the current Pixel 9 series. While several leaks have hinted at what to expect, the new leak reveals the storage options of the upcoming handset.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lgomyoqssc2a">Roland Quandt on BlueSky</a>, who shared that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> would launch with 128GB and 256GB storage options. It appears Google isn’t changing or adding storage options for its A-series lineup, as previous iterations, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, which also arrived in the same storage variants across regions.</p><p>On the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-pricing">Android Headlines</a> has shared that Google might introduce a price hike to the larger 256GB storage option of the Pixel 9a. The device would cost $599 for the 256GB, a slight price bump from the previous iteration, which cost $559. However, the publication indicates that the Pixel 9a could still start at $499 as before for the base 128GB model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:313px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:191.69%;"><img id="rM4FXH4GeEQhgdVohnLpjC" name="Pixel-9a-new-render-leak-01" alt="Pixel 9a render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rM4FXH4GeEQhgdVohnLpjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="313" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lgoqc73hzs2x">BlueSky post</a>, Quandt shared an image of the Pixel 9a from the front. Per the wallpaper, tipster notes that it could be the official render — although taken from a third-party phone accessories maker, which does reveal the front pane of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range handset</a>.</p><p>Although skeptical of this image into consideration, it still looks familiar to the Pixel 8a with rounded corners and the conventional punch-hole camera. While it also corroborates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">leaked renders</a>, the major difference that one could expect from the Pixel 9a, in terms of design, should be at the back.</p>
<p>It looks like Google might be bringing the signature camera bar at the back, which is quite popular amongst the flagship Pixel series. The leak suggests that the 9a will have dual cameras set up at the back, which appear completely flushed in towards the rear panel. These cameras are said to be a 48MP GN8 Quad Dual Pixel main camera accompanied by a 13MP secondary camera, and on the front, there could be another 13MP selfie shooter.</p><p>Also, the latest storage variant leak from Quandt corroborates with the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">detailed spec leak</a>, which further shared the same storage options next to the 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The same leak shared the device’s chipset, which is Google's Tensor G4 coupled with Titan M2 security processor. It will also feature a 6.3-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and the device’s color options comprise Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony.</p><p>The Pixel 9a, like its flagship counterparts, will likely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> along with the promise of seven-year OS updates, next to security and feature drops, which is a notable promise irrespective of being a mid-range phone.</p>

<p>It&apos;s tough being a middle child, but the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has risen to the challenge with a powerful blend of impressive specs, sophisticated design, and all of the AI-powered software features you could ever need. As we detail in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">our hands-on review</a>, the S25 Plus is all about refinement, improving upon its predecessor in a few key areas without raising the price. </p><p>You still get 12GB of RAM and a lovely 6.7-inch 120Hz display as standard, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is a huge leap forward when it comes to performance. The Galaxy AI features and One UI 7 are also present straight out of the box, plus you get great battery life and, of course, Samsung&apos;s seven-year software promise. </p><p>Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-galaxy-s24-plus">Galaxy S25 Plus to the S24 Plus</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the new model didn&apos;t receive any significant boost to its camera tech, and the changing speeds aren&apos;t exactly breaking any records. But if you have an old phone lying around and you&apos;re looking to upgrade, use Samsung&apos;s trade-in tool to see how much you can save. It costs nothing to check, and you might end up with a fantastic 2025 smartphone for next to nothing. </p>

<hr>
<p>Amidst the Samsung Unpacked chaos, one of the company's execs might've teased a strong future where we see a long-awaited health feature on a watch.</p><p>Samsung held a Health Forum in San Jose the day after Unpacked, where its senior vice president Hon Pak spoke about an old rumor: non-invasion glucose monitoring. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-glucose-monitoring-3519742/">Android Authority</a>, Pak informed those at the forum that the company was working on a new "noninvasive optically-based continuous" glucose monitoring.</p><p>While this is likely technology designed for a future Galaxy Watch, Hon Pak declined to say anything further.</p><p>He stated that while the feature is "exciting," he's unable to explicitly state when it could launch — or with which product.</p><p>However, our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/could-samsungs-galaxy-watch-8-finally-introduce-blood-glucose-monitoring">Tom's Guide</a> noticed the company published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-harnessing-the-power-of-ai-a-sneak-peek-into-how-samsung-is-turning-complexity-to-comprehension">an editorial</a> written by Hon Pak about the chase of non-invasive blood sugar monitoring. The post offers more details, stating that this optically-based feature will be joined by a newly developed "sensor algorithm." This algorithm is said to predict "early signs of diabetes" for users.</p><p>Pak's post also highlights the potential for a continuous integrated nutrition coaching feature <em>alongside </em>the basic monitoring functions Samsung is working on.</p><p>It seems that Samsung is leaning heavily on its AI software to help with the heavy lifting regarding its blood sugar monitoring and several other features. That's no surprise considering how heavily it's leaned into the "AI Phone" moniker, made obvious with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>. For now, speculation from our sister-site states this feature <em>could </em>debut with the Galaxy Watch 8, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>Hon Pak seems confident in the research and development progress behind this, as he states that, once it arrives, it "will be a game-changer" so long as "we do it right."</p>

<p>There's been talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">potential blood sugar monitoring</a> on a Galaxy Watch for a while now. What's remained consistent in the talks is the fact that Samsung is working on a non-invasive method so users wouldn't have to poke themselves with a needle. Samsung's Hon Pak stated during an interview early last year that the company is "putting significant investment toward that" — "that" being glucose monitoring.</p><p>Curiously, Apple has discussed bringing such functionality to its smartwatch; however, nothing has happened as of yet. It seems that Samsung ramped up its development and research of the feature as a result.</p><p>Hon Pak resurrected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">the topic last spring</a>, ahead of the Galaxy Watch 7 reveal later that summer. Diabetes and blood sugar monitoring were mentioned, as well as the possibility of adding in arrhythmia and hypertension for a future device. It was speculated at the time that a major hiccup in delivering this to consumers could be the regulatory factors down the road.</p><p>While this health feature was originally thought to be designed for the Galaxy Watch 7, we're now turning our attention to the Watch 8. Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8#:~:text=We%20later%20heard%20via%20South%20Korean%20news%20site">we'd love to see it</a> — considering Samsung's been working on this for a while — but we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-137">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Samsung January 2025 security update is rolling out now for a wide variety of Galaxy phones.</li><li>The patch includes 29 fixes from the Android Security Bulletin and 22 fixes specific to Galaxy phones.</li><li>You might have to wait for the update to appear on your device based on your carrier and region.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb" target="_blank">January 2025 security update</a> has been slowly appearing on select Galaxy phones for about a week, but it’s now becoming available for a much longer list of devices. The patch brings fixes included in this month’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-security-bulletin">Android Security Bulletin</a>, and includes a total of 29 patched vulnerabilities and problems. As such, you’ll want to apply the Samsung January 2025 security patch as soon as it becomes available for your device.</p><p>Of the 29 vulnerabilities addressed in the Android Security Bulletin, there are five items with “critical” security levels. The rest have a “high” security level, and there were no “moderate” vulnerabilities in this month’s Android Security Bulletin. As usual, issues affecting non-Samsung devices were omitted, and Samsung addressed 22 of its own vulnerabilities to round out the January 2025 update.</p><p>The January 2025 patch has been appearing on certain phones dating back to last week, but we now have a full list of devices currently eligible to receive it (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/samsung-galaxy-january-2025-update-list/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>):</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S24</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S24+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S23</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S23+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 FE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20 FE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold SE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A16</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A15</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A14</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A54</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A32</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Note 20</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</li></ul>
<p>As you can see, it’s a lengthy list featuring the Galaxy S, Galaxy Z, Galaxy A, and Galaxy Note series. However, you should know that security patches are rolled out not only by device model, but also by carrier or region.

<p>Meta is starting the week with a new, more personal feature for its "Meta AI" chat feature in its apps.</p><p>Recently, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared an update with users within the Meta Channel on Instagram regarding a new update for Meta AI. As spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich, Zuckerberg states that the AI will now provide personalized answers based on "what preferences and information you've shared." It's likely the AI leverages things like places you like, spots you enjoy eating at, and the like.</p><p>As an example, Zuckerberg states Meta AI is able to create a fictional bedtime story that remains in theme with what his children enjoy: mermaids.</p><p>Zuckerberg states that his daughters "love mermaids" and a chat log snapshot shows that he's asked Meta AI to create a story like that before. However, asking the AI to create <em>another </em>story using "things my daughters love" delivers a response similar to history.</p>

<p>In a Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/building-toward-a-smarter-more-personalized-assistant/">newsroom post</a>, the company expanded on the new memory features for the AI that its CEO briefly highlighted in the Instagram channel. What Zuckerberg mentioned is likely the "greater level of personalization" detailed in this blog post. This capability is wrapped in the AI's memory function, as the AI will now deliver responses utilizing your "home location you’ve listed," Reels viewing history, and the fact that you may be married with a few kids.</p><p>Meta states its AI will use any shared, relevant information to offer an answer that <em>should </em>fit what you're looking for. This feature is rolling out today (Jan 27) on Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>The post also reiterates the recent launch of Meta AI's "memory boost." Users can tell the AI specific things about themselves — like if they're vegan — and the AI will internalize it to reconfigure its future responses with that in mind. Memory boost is only functional in one-on-one chats with Meta AI and will not work in group chats.</p><p>It appears that this feature is rolling out more widely for users on Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Meta AI has slowly continued to deliver new features with a range of uses, like its ability <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">to "see" your pictures</a>. Sharing pictures with the AI provides a few editing options. Users can ask Meta AI to remove certain blemishes in a photo or they can ask it to alter anything about it using its generative AI tools. Moreover, taking a picture of food and submitting it to the AI can grant you its recipe if the AI can narrow it down.</p><p>A more fun update arrived via "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-imagine-me-selfie-all-platforms">Imagine Me</a>," which lets users take a selfie, upload it to the AI, and let it turn them into anything they want.</p>

<p>Samsung Project Moohan made waves when Samsung announced it alongside Android XR, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">new and exciting version of Android</a> built specifically for XR devices like AR glasses, VR headsets, and mixed reality headsets. It's an upcoming mixed reality headset that will blend the virtual and real worlds into games and productivity, just like the Meta Quest 3.</p><p>Project Moohan, as it's currently known, will receive a final product name sometime later this year before the expected launch. Samsung showed off the hardware for the first time publicly at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Samsung Unpacked 2025</a> during the Galaxy S25 unveiling.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan is said to sport higher-end hardware than the Meta Quest 3 and promises to be the best VR hardware to date, merging quality hardware with a more affordable price tag than the Apple Vision Pro. But does that mean it will be a better headset? Let's find out.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both Samsung Project Moohan and the Meta Quest 3 are mixed reality headsets, they each look and fit quite differently. The Meta Quest 3 is designed mostly to fit cost restraints so it can be under $500. That includes shipping with a relatively uncomfortable cloth strap for your head and an all-plastic design.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan has a far more premium look and feel, and while some parts are plastic to keep weight down, it looks a lot more like a Meta Quest Pro than a Meta Quest 3. This includes rigid side straps with a wheel on the back for quickly adjusting size, a large, plush pad for the back of your head, and another large plush pad for your forehead.</p><p>Unlike the Meta Quest 3, Project Moohan doesn't put any weight on your face at all. The rubber light blockers are magnetically removable — Samsung hasn't even shown off these parts of the headset yet — so you'll feel no pressure on your face while wearing the headset for long periods of time.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>You can swap out the Meta Quest 3's face pad, head strap, and more, ensuring it fits you perfectly.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3's default cloth strap distributes weight on your face and around the sides and back of your head. Some people, like me, find this to be uncomfortable and end up buying a third-party head strap along with several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> to make it more comfortable to wear.</p><p>While this sounds like a negative at first, Meta's "modular" design of the Quest 3 means you can take all the important parts off — the head strap, the face pad, etc — and replace them with ones you find more comfortable.</p><p>When I work while wearing a Quest 3, I tend to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Boost-Battery-Compatible/dp/B0D6W88TCN/">Kiwi Design H4 Boost</a> head strap and I take the face pad off completely so the headset's weight isn't resting on my face. Otherwise, when I'm gaming with a Quest 3, I keep the face pad on to provide maximum immersion.</p><p>It's not clear yet if Project Moohan will be a modular headset. One of the biggest problems with the Meta Quest Pro was that its head strap and battery couldn't be easily removed, so you had to add things to the headset instead of easily replacing them with something more comfortable. We're hoping Samsung learned from Meta's design mistake on its Pro headset.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Project Moohan has automatic IPD adjustment, giving it an advantage over any other VR headset on the market.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung Project Moohan has automatic IPD adjustment thanks to its eye tracking capabilities which ensures that each user has the exact right eye distance calibration the moment they put the headset on. That's a huge advantage for Samsung over every other VR headset on the market which all require manual IPD adjustment.</p><p>Some headsets, like the PlayStation VR2, will help you choose the right IPD by using eye tracking to display an image you can line up. The Meta Quest 3, like most other VR headsets, requires you to know your IPD ahead of time. Adjusting it on a Quest 3 is easy and can be done via the IPD wheel on the underside of the headset, but you still need to know the right number before using it.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung's headset supports controllers but we haven't seen them yet.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 ships with two motion controllers — one is held in each hand — and also supports controller-free hand tracking for more effortless interactions. Each of these controllers features a joystick, three face buttons, a trigger, and a grip button.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan will also have controller and hand tracking support, but Samsung hasn't confirmed if the headset will ship with controllers included or if they'll be a separate purchase. Apple Vision Pro famously shipped with no controllers and no support for motion-tracked controllers. Apple later added support for controllers due to feedback, as they're simply required for some experiences and types of games.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multiple-windows" alt="Using a Meta Quest 3 with six windows open at once" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Multitasking on a Meta Quest 3 running Meta Horizon OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta Horizon OS, the operating system that powers Meta Quest Headsets, is built upon Android and always has been. Similarly, Android XR, which powers Samsung Project Moohan, is also a specific version of Android built for XR devices. While they sound similar on the surface, there are some significant key differences to consider.</p><p>While both are based on the Android Open Source Project, Meta Horizon OS features significant layers of customization that Meta has built over the past decade. Meta has built so much on top of Android that it actually packages it as a "separate" operating system, calling it Meta Horizon OS, and now offers it as an option for third-party companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">to build their own headsets on</a>.</p><p>Meta Horizon OS not only revolves around the "Meta Horizon experience," which includes promoting the Meta Horizon metaverse app front and center, but also ties Meta services deeply into the OS. Apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram all have native Horizon OS apps, and while a few other apps can be downloaded on the app store, Meta Quest headsets are still mainly gaming consoles with some extra computing functionality.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Quest's operating system is built on Android but doesn't feature the Google Play Store. Android XR will.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Android XR is built upon the Android Open Source Project as well but, like most builds of Android, Google services are at the center. Android XR is said to be "the first version of Android built for the Gemini era" which means Google Gemini is able to operate the entire experience if you ask it to.</p><p>Google explained that Gemini can see what you see, including both the virtual and real world, and is able to answer questions and interact with virtual screens as you see fit. This could open up significant new design and interaction paradigms that we simply haven't seen before, but we'll need to wait until the full product launch to get a better idea of the actual functionality.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Both operating systems are designed to enable multitasking in mixed reality, plus allow for full immersive apps and games.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Both operating systems support native multitasking, giving users the ability to open multiple windows at once and float them anywhere in real 3D space. You can think of these a bit like resizable virtual monitors that you can place anywhere, all of which are able to be interacted with like a smartphone or tablet interface.</p><p>Since Android XR has the Google Play Store built in, it's expected that Samsung Project Moohan will have substantially more 2D apps at launch than the Meta Quest ever has. Conversely, the Meta Quest sports thousands of games that will take time to convert over to Android XR. Meta funded several of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, so it's not likely they'll see a release on an Android XR-powered headset.</p><p>If you want to learn more about how both operating systems compare, see our detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR vs Meta Horizon OS</a> comparison.</p>

<p>Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets power the Meta Quest 3 and Samsung Project Moohan, but Project Moohan features the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a>. This new chipset allows Samsung to include higher resolution cameras and displays on Project Moohan, all while sporting better overall performance.</p><p>Neither are "laptop-grade" chips like what's included in the Apple Vision Pro, but both chips are very capable and are roughly comparable in performance to a 2023 flagship smartphone with significant customizations to account for the extra processing needed for space tracking and motion tracking.</p><p>We know a some specs for Project Moohan but many technical specs, like amount of RAM, storage, and display resolution, are still unknown. It's said that Samsung Project Moohan features micro-OLED panels with up to 3,000 DPI resolution. The Meta Quest 3 uses LCD panels with roughly 1,200 DPI resolution.</p>

<p>Both headsets use pancake lenses, but Samsung Project Moohan builds eye tracking into the lenses. This will enable Samsung to have even better performance thanks to something called foveated rendering. This technology allows the headset to render the highest resolution at the center of your vision while saving processing power by lowering the resolution outside of that.</p><p>Meta supports fixed foveated rendering which attempts to recreate the same concept without eye tracking. While it is effective in enhancing performance, it creates lower resolution outside of the center of the lens and reduces visual quality in those areas.</p>

<p>Considering you cannot buy Samsung Project Moohan yet, this one's a bit of a no-brainer until then. The Meta Quest 3 is the best VR headset you can buy in terms of value and available software. It's got the most games of any VR headset and, since it's a standalone VR console, doesn't need a PC or external display to work. That's an amazing value for just $499.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan will almost certainly sport better hardware than the Meta Quest 3 when it launches, but it's expected that Samsung will charge quite a bit more for its first Android XR-powered headset. Current rumors estimate the price to be around $999, although we'll need to wait until later in the year to actually find out.</p><p>If you're looking to get into XR today, though, the Meta Quest 3 is the right choice as it not only has a vast library of games and support for many streaming services, but it also supports native Windows desktop streaming for easy hookup to a PC.</p>

With the Google Pixel 9 series, there's a new option besides taking an awkward selfie, asking a stranger for help, or leaving someone out. Google introduced a feature called <strong>Add me</strong> with the Pixel 9, and it uses AI to merge two photos together, allowing everyone to be in the shot.</p><p>That might sound tricky, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-10-11-series-google-ai-camera-leaks">Pixel Camera app</a> offers detailed instructions and visual aids to help line up each photo just right. While there are some clues that Add Me photos aren't quite the real thing, they turn out pretty great considering the circumstances and allow everyone to be included. If you're eager to try Google's newest advanced camera feature, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> phone.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> is a quick way to take a group photo with everyone in the frame without having an extra photographer. The way it works is simple. Everyone will get together for a photo except one person, while leaving space for the photographer. After the first photographer takes a photo, they'll switch with someone else, filling in the empty space.</p><p>Then, the Pixel Camera app will guide the second photographer, helping them line up the shot in the exact same spot as the first photo. From there, Google's AI will merge the two photos together, making it look as if everyone was there at the same time. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos app</a>, you'll see the Add Me version of the photo, plus an expanded version with the two separate shots.</p><p>Of course, since it's an AI feature, it won't always be perfect — be sure to check the results before settling on your Add Me image.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-add-me-on-the-pixel-9-series-2">How to use Add Me on the Pixel 9 series</h2>
<p>Using Add Me on the Google Pixel 9 series is quick and easy. In simple terms, you and another person will take two photos while switching places. After that, Google's AI software will merge the two pictures together, creating one seamless image. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Camera app</strong> on your Pixel 9 series device.</p><p>2. Swipe to the <strong>Add Me</strong> mode in the carousel.</p><p>3. Follow the on-screen prompts to learn how to use Add Me. Tap <strong>Don't show again</strong> if you don't want to see these prompts every time you use Add Me.</p><p>4. <strong>Take the first photo</strong>, while leaving space for yourself.</p><p>5. <strong>Hand off the phone to another person</strong>.</p><p>6. The next person will need to <strong>align the frame</strong> of the viewfinder with that of the first photo, and then capture it.</p>

<p>It's easy to see the situations where Add Me could really come in handy. We've all had times when someone was left out of a photo because there was no one available to take it. Instead of using a timer or taking an awkward selfie, Add Me on the Pixel 9 series can be a better option. It's easy enough that anyone can do it, and the Pixel Camera app guides you every step of the way.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has introduced a “New Galaxy Club” program for users interested in purchasing the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>Users who have purchased an S25 series device can opt for an additional subscription to help them upgrade their device next year.</li><li>The upgrade program is currently available in the U.S. region.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra launched globally, Samsung has a new upgrade program that allows users to upgrade to a new phone after twelve months.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/new-galaxy-club/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">New Galaxy Club</a> early upgrade program is a fee that can be added to the price of your device. As detailed in a lengthy blog post, the subscription program lets trade their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> device after 12 months for the latest Galaxy and receive up to 50% off on their next device.</p><p>For the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S25 Plus, users who want to opt in for this club membership need to shell out an additional $8.33, while owners of the base Galaxy S25 pay $6.20.</p><p>This means that when you pay the subscription fees for the New Galaxy Club every month for twelve consecutive months, Samsung will give you the option to upgrade to a newer Galaxy flagship phone, which at that time will likely be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a>. It could give you up to 50% off of the phone based on what you paid for your Galaxy S25.</p><p>Let's say you want to get the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>; by paying the full $1299 MSRP upfront or within a relatively short period and opting in to be the New Galaxy Club member at $8.33/month, you will get $650 off on your next Galaxy flagship when you turn in the Ultra at the end of twelve months.</p><p>The other option is for Samsung to pay the remaining balance on the phone if you choose to pay via a 24-month installment. This means when it's time to upgrade, you'll be off the hook for the Galaxy S25 and can start putting money towards the Galaxy S26.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YuLZUzbWu8mbPuLeHhC6kX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-display-03" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the displays on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuLZUzbWu8mbPuLeHhC6kX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, New Galaxy Club enrollees will receive one year of Samsung Care Plus (without Theft and Loss) benefits, which is a plus.</p><p>Samsung account holders will also have easier access to the New Galaxy Club. However, it is not mandatory to have an account to subscribe to this program. This can track or cancel their subscriptions at their convenience without contacting Samsung customer support. The new upgrade program is available for consumers in the U.S. and can only be accessed through the Samsung website or the Shop Samsung app.</p>
<p>Users can choose to cancel their New Galaxy Club subscription at any time, but the past monthly fees will not be refunded in case of cancellation.</p><p>The New Galaxy Club program comes along with the other great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25 preorder deals</a> already available in the U.S. region and could help users get their hands on the latest and greatest at a cheaper price when the launch rolls around.</p>

<p><em>**Correction**: The previous version of this article stated that users can get the Galaxy S25 series at cheaper rates with the New Galaxy Club program. This is incorrect, and the article has been updated with the necessary details to reflect the correct benefits of Samsung's new club program. We regret the error.</em></p>

<hr>
<p>A Samsung blog says Galaxy S25 Ultra users can buy a Bluetooth S Pen separately, suggesting the phone supports it. But oddly, Samsung’s own marketplace doesn't list a Bluetooth S Pen for the handset.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> flexes Samsung’s tech muscle with powerful AI features and Qualcomm’s latest chipset. It’s also impressively slim and lightweight, but that sleek design comes at a cost. The S Pen, a signature of the Ultra lineup, has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">lost its Bluetooth functionality</a>, leaving out some advanced features fans love.</p><p>A Samsung Business Insights <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insights.samsung.com/2025/01/24/how-to-boost-productivity-with-the-s-pen-on-your-galaxy-s25-ultra/" target="_blank">blog</a> could be the light at the end of the tunnel, saying Galaxy S25 Ultra owners can buy a Bluetooth S Pen separately, as spotted by @WorkaholicDavid. Adding to this, some Amazon listings for the official S25 Ultra S Pen in certain regions also mention Bluetooth support.</p>

<p>However, Samsung’s official sites show no sign of a dedicated Bluetooth S Pen, listing only the standard Galaxy S25 Ultra S Pen and the S Pen Pro.</p><p>A Samsung rep initially told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-conflicting-information-bluetooth-s-pen-s25-ultra-3520218/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> the S Pen Pro was compatible, but that claim quickly fell apart.

It's best to wait for an official statement from Samsung to get a clear answer.</p><p>It's possible that Samsung might have decided to sell a Bluetooth S Pen separately at a later stage, leading to inconsistencies in their own information. Another possible scenario is that Samsung's websites or retail partners may have included placeholder information or mistakenly listed Bluetooth support for the standard S Pen.</p>

<p>An upcoming update to the Google Sounds app might bring new haptic feedback options to Pixel devices, giving users more control over how their phone feels during different system events.</p><p>This information was brought to light by Android expert Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-sounds-custom-vibration-pattern-3507934/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> after obtaining an APK of Google Sounds version 3.2 via a tip provided by Nail Sadykov.</p><p>In version 3.2, the Ringtone Alert section has separate "Sounds" and "Vibrations" tabs. Android Authority’s screenshots show off 12 vibration patterns for ringtones and 11 more just for notifications.</p><p>For ringtones, these are the vibration patterns available:</p>
<ul><li>Synchronized</li><li>Classic Long Vibration</li><li>Bumps</li><li>Buzz</li><li>Rhythm</li><li>Swirl</li><li>Drumbeat</li><li>Swoop</li><li>Snare</li><li>Gentle wave</li><li>Heartbeat</li><li>Gears</li></ul>

<p>According to Android Authority, each vibration pattern has its own mix of intensity and duration, so you can really make your Pixel feel like yours. But it’s still up in the air if the Vibration & Haptics sliders will give you even more control.</p><p>On top of that, Rahman spotted some visual tweaks in the Sound & Vibration menu inside the device’s Settings.</p><p>In the Sound & Vibration menu, the "Phone ringtone" and "Default notification sound" options will get new names: "Ringtone alert" and "Notification alert." These will now sit right below the volume sliders for Calls, Ringtones, Notifications, and Alarms.</p><p>Google Sounds version 3.2, with its new vibration patterns for Pixel phones, isn't available yet. It hasn't hit the Play Store, and you can’t sideload it either at the moment.</p><p>Right now, there’s no clear timeline for when these new vibration patterns will roll out on Pixel devices. Some think they might drop with an upcoming update to Google Sounds or possibly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">next Android 16 beta</a>, which just made its debut a couple of days ago.</p>

<h2 id="your-search-for-a-great-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protector-ends-here-2">Your search for a great Galaxy S25 Ultra screen protector ends here</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hasn't changed much in terms of proportions, however, the corners are drastically different. Instead of the S24 Ultra's sharp corners, the S25 Ultra favors softer, rounded-out edges. This means you'll have to be extra careful when buying glass screen protectors for it, as glass protectors don't do well with curves generally. Luckily, there's a great selection of full-coverage screen protectors available for the device.</p><p>Whether you prioritize price, value, and quality, the amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra wins it all. You can easily install the included duo of 9H tempered glass on your phone using the assistive frame. Each glass protector is highly scratch-resistant and repels fingerprints, keeping it squeaky clean. The set also includes two camera lens protectors for good measure. The price is incredibly affordable, making this a home run.</p><p>If you want a case-friendly Galaxy S25 Uscreen protector, you could either opt for a plastic film like the ArmorSuit MilitaryShield HD Clear Film or stick with a glass option like the one from Spigen. And while you're at it, don't forget about grabbing a robust <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">case for your Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. We've got an informative guide to help you decide on an appropriate one for yourself.</p>

As someone with steadily worsening eyesight, I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">never liked using MIP displays</a> except during sunny workouts where they shine, so to speak. Indoors, COROS watches weren't that fun to use.</p><p>The PACE Pro felt inevitable and overdue after rivals like Garmin, Suunto, and Polar adopted AMOLED en masse in 2023 and 2024. I loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, calling it the best affordable watch of 2023, but only because MIP felt like a fair sacrifice for the price. The PACE Pro had a higher bar to clear, both for its $349 price tag and my expectations.</p><p>Since late October, I've taken the COROS PACE Pro on dozens of runs, hikes, and workouts, comparing it against other recent fitness watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a>. I've come away impressed, or at least satisfied, with its accuracy and performance in key areas.</p><p>While it's taken me too long to get this review out, that's only a reflection of how jam-packed 2024 was with smartwatches to test, not its quality or importance. If you're on the hunt for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">reliable running watch</a>, I'd look seriously at the COROS PACE Pro.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-coros-pace-pro-models-and-specs"><span>COROS PACE Pro: Models and specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WAQ4ULqeVWecSfuLqpVqv8" name="COROS-PACE-Pro-black-and-white-models" alt="The Gray and Black COROS PACE Pro watches sitting on a blanket side-by-side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WAQ4ULqeVWecSfuLqpVqv8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The COROS PACE Pro launched on October 31, 2024, for $349 / CA$499 / €399 / £349 / A$599. It currently ships in three colors — Black, Gray, and Blue — and only has one 46mm case / 1.3-inch display size. It defaults to a silicone strap that matches the case color, but you can buy a nylon strap for $29 that reduces the weight by 12g if you prefer.</p><p>The first "Pro" of the PACE lineup, it arrived about a year after the PACE 3 with some key upgrades. The most noticeable is the display boost from a 1.2-inch non-touch MIP to a 1.3-inch AMOLED touchscreen with an extra 120 pixels per inch and improved brightness.</p><p>Plus, you get an extra five days or 16 dual-band GPS hours of battery life, despite the switch to a more vivid screen.</p><p>You also receive 2X and 3X faster CPU and RAM, respectively, along with 3X faster wi-fi downloads and 32GB storage instead of 4GB (for maps and music). COROS adds new features to every watch that's <em>capable</em> of it; since the PACE Pro has the fastest processor yet, it's capable of performance-heavy features like mapping <em>and</em> should get years of post-launch updates.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: COROS contacted me during my review that "a small number of watches from the first production have a minor defect risk when exposed to incredibly dry and cold conditions. These conditions caused some watches to overheat and be uncomfortable to wear. This issue was resolved before PACE Pro went on sale and there is no risk that consumer units will have this issue. Only early samples were impacted."</p><p>I myself never had this issue, but I finished my review with the Black PACE Pro after starting with the Gray PACE Pro, which is currently disabled. Neither model had any noticeable differences in terms of accuracy or performance.</p>

<p>Reviewing COROS watches can feel a bit repetitive because each model builds upon the other. The features I liked in the 2021 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/coros-pace-2-review">PACE 2</a>, 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">APEX 2</a>, and 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-announced-with-46-day-battery">VERTIX 2S</a> mostly apply to the PACE Pro, even though the VERTIX costs twice as much.</p><p>Generally speaking, COROS watches are lightweight, long-lived, and simple to navigate through the core widgets using the crown (or "digital dial"). COROS doesn't lock features to pricier or newer models, so everything the PACE Pro tracks is already available on the other watches (unless their processors are too old to support them).</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Using the PACE 3 software won't feel any different to 2022 APEX 2 owners; it's mainly the display, materials, and GPS that have changed.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That's why testing the PACE Pro is extremely familiar. COROS' EvoLab training metrics have remained largely unchanged. You see after every run how hard you worked out, how much of your activity splits into different heart rate zones, how long to rest before your next run, and other core data that runners need to succeed. Aside from a couple of missing features I'd love added, it's fairly comprehensive and only improving over time.</p><p>With just a few crown twists, you'll find your daily activity stats, training load and training status, recovery estimates, sleep stats, barometer, and other data; a few other useful widgets like race predictions and intensity distributions in the submenus by pressing the dial.</p><p>The UI isn't great for anyone who cares about apps, messaging, or a virtual assistant, but it is perfectly specialized for athletes who <em>don't</em> use their watches much outside of sports and checking notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5oxYT5JWSL4XotEthswdbL" name="Coros-pace-pro-training-load" alt="Training load data on the COROS PACE Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5oxYT5JWSL4XotEthswdbL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software can lag behind rival fitness brands for key features, but COROS has been on an update tear recently to catch up (even if COROS itself wouldn't frame it that way). And it makes the PACE Pro a more well-rounded device for athletes.</p><p>Just in 2024, we've seen COROS add daily stress tracking, wellness checks, sleep stages & quality, and nap detection. I think some equivalent to Garmin Body Battery or Fitbit Daily Readiness is the next logical step to this collective data, though COROS only has a Recovery widget for now. The PACE Pro is much better at knowing the state of your body rather than guessing based on your fitness level and workout intensity.</p><p>COROS also added niche fitness tools that made the PACE Pro and its siblings better specialized for serious athletes: real-time group tracking, gear tracking, safety alerts to emergency contacts, virtual pacing, cycling power modes, Strava Live Segments, and turn-by-turn alert arrows. The latter two make the PACE Pro more <em>useable</em> if you care about route navigation or tend to re-run the same routes and want to pace yourself in real-time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zKe4qgY4zeKoFsSTjgMzh8" name="COROS-PACE-Pro-map-mode" alt="A topographical map mode on the COROS PACE Pro, sitting on top of a wooden armrest.

<p>What's most important to me is that the PACE Pro has downloadable maps that provide background info to your routes, while the $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> only has breadcrumb navigation — topo maps are restricted to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>.</p><p>COROS splits its map into grids, so it only takes a couple of minutes to download a particular region if, for instance, you're vacationing somewhere new or flying to a destination marathon. Creating a route in the COROS app is as simple as plopping down Start and End waypoints; power users can import GPX files or use partnered apps like Strava or Komoot to make routes, as well.</p><p>I rarely use map routes on any smartwatch, but I enjoy following them on the PACE Pro over any other brand for one simple reason: the crown. On my Fenix 8, I have to press the Up/Down buttons to zoom in and out, and it feels laggy and laborious; on my PACE Pro, it's as simple as scrolling the dial, and the speedy CPU makes the zoom-in or out feel effortless and quick. I jump from an eagle-eyed view to a close perspective in moments.</p><p>Maybe the map can pan and zoom so quickly because it lacks any street/trail names or points of interest, so there's no context for what's around you. COROS told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/coros-review-amoled.html#" target="_blank">DCR</a> that "trail/road labels are coming in Q1 2025" — another example of COROS' speedy update cadence paying off — and for now, that's the only negative to an otherwise positive map feature.</p>

<p>The core PACE Pro experience is lightweight and reasonably thin, uses only a fraction of its battery after an hour-long dual-frequency GPS run, and has a quick-release strap switch so you can buy and swap in any third-party option you prefer — though COROS' silicone and nylon replacements are very affordable at $29 apiece.</p><p>I like the default silicone band because of its breathable design and its two-slot buckle that keeps the watch securely in place, while other bands have some bounce during hard runs unless they're fastened tightly.</p><p>With AOD mode on, the PACE Pro is rated to last six days, though I never make it that long with daily workouts. Without AOD, it's rated to last 20 days; again, I found that estimate is a bit generous, but it still easily makes it a couple of weeks with sleep/stress tracking and regular GPS activities, which is a standard that'll keep 99% of runners happy enough.</p>

<p>Back in November, I did an in-depth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro fitness test</a> against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> for dual-band GPS accuracy and the Polar H10 for heart rate accuracy, including several long runs, a hike, and a track workout. Rather than repost 1,500 words and a dozen graphs here, I'll briefly quote my findings.</p><p>For location accuracy, "COROS' redesigned antenna and new GPS chipset paid off" with a "definite improvement in GPS accuracy" compared to past dual-band COROS watches that put it on par with Garmin's $1,100 flagship.</p><p>For heart rate accuracy, I didn't see a noticeable difference between the PACE Pro and PACE 3 despite getting a redesigned optical sensor. It's "generally reliable for heart rate" and better than your average running watch, but it did fall distinctly short during an anaerobic workout and was slightly too high on average over a long hike. I recommended "buying the COROS armband... if you need the best possible results," but found it good enough for most runners.</p><p>Since then, I've used the COROS PACE Pro for several more multi-watch runs, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">20-mile race wearing four watches</a>, to test more comprehensively how accurate it is. Here's what I found:</p>

<p>The two heart rate charts above show two more track workouts. The first is more of the same: the PACE Pro fell 2 bpm short of my chest strap's average because the watch couldn't keep up when my heart rate rose rapidly for 400m or 800m sets.</p><p>For my second workout, I did a sustained workout where I jogged in between hard 200m sets instead of pausing fully, and the results were much better. You can still see a distinct difference between the two, but the gap was smaller, and the rising and falling heart rates allowed the PACE Pro to balance out when it was too high or low. The HR average ended up being the same for both.</p>

<p>For a "normal" 13-mile run, the COROS PACE Pro did well enough, though there's always going to be a gap between a chest strap and an optical wrist-based monitor. Aside from a couple of heart rate spikes, the PACE Pro was generally a couple of beats behind the Polar H10, needing a little time to catch up.</p><p>It ultimately fell 1 bpm short of the H10's average. Still, an everyday runner will find the results more than good enough for accurate heart rate zones and training load.</p>

<p>I'm including a few more GPS screenshots with the COROS PACE Pro (<em>orange</em>) and Garmin Fenix 8 (<em>blue</em>) from that same 13-mile run, which ended with Garmin and COROS measuring 13.20 and 13.17 miles, respectively. As you'd expect from such similar results, the GPS maps are boringly similar, if imperfect. (<em>Click the box icon to zoom in</em>.)</p><p>Basically, Garmin and COROS tend to be parallel to or overlap one another in most places, but do occasionally drift a bit into the street. COROS' past dual-band watches didn't seem to do as well, but the PACE Pro seems fully reliable at this point and frequently beats Garmin's $1,100 watch.</p><p>You can count on the PACE Pro for reliable GPS results, and that's arguably more important than HR accuracy: Serious athletes can buy an external HRM if you need perfect results — such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM armband</a>, which syncs automatically with the PACE Pro — but they <em>can't</em> buy a satellite signal booster (as far as I know).</p>

<p>I'd personally choose a PACE Pro over a COROS APEX 2 because of the faster processor, dual-band GPS, 4x storage, and switch to AMOLED. However, some will appreciate the APEX's titanium case and sapphire glass, while the PACE Pro has a decidedly "sporty" appearance, which some might call cheap-looking. There's a reason why it did poorly in my recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a>.</p><p>Whichever COROS watch you buy, you're not getting NFC for contactless payments. Rival fitness brands like Polar and Suunto share this issue; unlike Garmin, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LOGICMARK-INC-31299906/news/Garmin-International-Inc-completed-the-acquisition-of-FitPay-Inc-from-Nxt-ID-Inc-for-3-4-mill-34156278/">spent millions to acquire FitPay</a> in 2019, most smaller watch brands like COROS don't have access to NFC technology, which is a deal-breaker for some runners who want to leave their cards at home.</p><p>On a similar note, COROS doesn't have any major music partnerships, so if you care about music storage, you have to connect your watch to your computer and drag MP3 files into a folder. There are no playlists, and songs are organized by upload order. That makes the feature useless for those who don't have hard copies of their music and annoying for anyone who'd prefer customizability instead of one library of songs.</p>

<p>Having spent so much time testing Wear OS and Apple Watches in 2024, I do find the COROS UI fairly regressive. Having most of your apps, health sensors, and settings hidden behind a Back Button-long press, then having to scroll through your options one-by-one instead of swiping through an app drawer, is a pain.</p><p>Instead of being able to check notifications with a swipe from your home screen, you have to scroll through your widgets, select "Notifications," and then scroll through the lot. I've also found that emojis and photos don't seem to show up; COROS isn't taking full advantage of its AMOLED upgrade, in this case.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>COROS watches have missing or barebones features; some will be essential deal-breakers; others, you may not even notice.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The watch face selection is adequate, if not as widespread as you get with most other smartwatches. Aesthetics aside, my main problem is with the lack of complications: you can't customize the data you see on the watch faces; only tap the back button on the home screen to swap between a few pre-chosen metrics like heart rate, sunrise/sunset, and elevation. If I want to see my current training load, recovery time, or other stats without having to scroll through menus, I should be able to! And I should be able to tap & hold those complications to jump to the relevant graph.</p><p>Beyond these main frustrations, I'd love to see an equivalent to Garmin's daily suggested workouts rather than having to depend fully on long-term plans in the Training Hub. Pointing out whether I need more easy/medium/hard activity and how much training load I need (without overtraining) seems like something COROS could do. The same goes for audio prompts that tell you your mile time or announce your next workout interval through the speaker or your earbuds without having to look at your screen.</p>

<p>The main COROS PACE Pro rivals are the $449 Garmin Forerunner 265, $399 Polar Vantage M3, and $349 Suunto Race S. They're all mid-range, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">multisport smartwatches</a> with AMOLED displays, training load and recovery guidance, dual-band GPS, and at least a week of battery life per charge. Both Polar and Suunto have downloadable maps, too.</p><p>I'm accustomed to Garmin Forerunner watches, with access to Garmin Pay, Body Battery, daily suggested workouts, morning reports, audio prompts, ANT+ accessories, and a better selection of customizable watch faces. The PACE Pro has a significantly longer battery life than the Forerunner 265, plus ECG readings and downloadable maps instead of merely breadcrumb navigation. Both have 1.3-inch displays, but you can buy the 1.1-inch Forerunner 265S if you prefer a lighter experience. Whether you prefer a crown or Up/Down buttons for navigation during activities is subjective.</p><p>The Polar Vantage M3 will be my next review after the PACE Pro, but it had solid GPS accuracy and middling heart rate accuracy in my initial testing. I can't think of any obvious software advantages either COROS or Polar have over one another, but the PACE Pro has far superior battery life and display brightness, while the Vantage M3 has skin temperature readings, a display flashlight, and a wider array of useful performance and recovery tests.</p><p>Having only reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a>, I can't say personally how well the Race S would compare, except that it's the only other option with a crown if that's a main COROS perk for you, plus a classier stainless steel bezel. Its battery life is only a week per charge, and it has no music storage capabilities, but it has unique Suunto Apps that you can download onto the watch that add unique smarts.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the COROS PACE Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're a COROS user who's been waiting for an AMOLED display.</li><li>You're a serious runner looking for epic battery life and useful training guidance to hit PRs.</li><li>You want a watch with reliable GPS and heart rate accuracy.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy the COROS PACE Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You care as much about style or ruggedness as training features.</li><li>You need a specific, missing feature like contactless payments or Spotify playlists.</li><li>You're not a fan of crowns for navigation.</li></ul>
<p>I never like giving scores to my reviews because it simplifies a complicated conversation. I'm giving the PACE Pro a lower score than the PACE 3 — or the same score as the APEX 2 — even though I'd wear the Pro over either watch without a second thought.</p><p>Even if it's an unfair comparison, the PACE Pro costs more than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, and so I have to weigh its shortcomings in areas like smarts and design on a stricter scale. And as I've reviewed a wider array of watches, it's made it clearer in hindsight how past COROS watches fell short in key health and fitness areas until they closed the gap last year. I'm stricter than I was in the past when I wasn't experienced enough to see what was missing.</p><p>What matters most is that the COROS PACE Pro is an excellent running watch, without a doubt. It delivers accurate GPS & HR results, as well as useful insights into my training load and recovery, with similar findings to other reliable brands. And you're no longer stuck with a dull, low-res MIP display in between workouts.</p><p>While the PACE Pro has its shortcomings, I'm genuinely excited to see how feature updates throughout 2025 will fix some of them. Otherwise, I'm hoping we'll see an APEX 3 soon that delivers the same accuracy and display boost paired with a more stylish titanium design.</p>

<p>Oppo is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-2-could-be-half-the-thickness-of-an-iphone">hyping up the Find N5’s super-slim folded profile</a>, and a new leak gives us a closer look at its sleek design, hinting at what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> might also bring.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/24/oppo-find-n5s-new-images-give-glimpse-of-front-display-reduced-camera-bulge/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a> reports that supposed live shots of the Oppo Find N5 have surfaced courtesy of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/1750270991" target="_blank">Weibo user</a>. Earlier leaks hinted that the device could be under 9.2mm thick when folded.</p><p>That means the Find N5 may outdo the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> in slimness when unfolded, potentially coming in at less than 4.35mm.</p><p>The latest Oppo Find N5 images show the phone folded, highlighting a much subtler camera bump compared to the Find N3.</p><p>Nonetheless, you might have preferred the bigger bump on the Find N3. That said, the new design is definitely more stylish and will probably win you over.</p><p>Furthermore, the new images clearly confirm earlier reports that the Find N5 will feature a flat exterior display.</p><p>Reports suggest the Find N5 will sport a 2K display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It’s likely to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, with up to 16GB of RAM and a massive 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>The leaked images also give us a sneak peek at the Find N5's design, showing off a sleek frosted right-angle middle frame that feels premium. On the left edge, there’s the signature alert slider for easy notification control, while the right edge features the volume rocker and a power button, likely with a built-in fingerprint sensor.</p>

<p>The device features stereo speakers, with drivers placed on both the top and bottom. You can spot a microphone near the lower speaker grille. The bottom edge also has a USB-C port and a SIM card slot, though the slot is hidden by a digit in the leaked images.</p><p>With the OnePlus Open 2 expected to closely resemble the Oppo Find N5, these leaks could give us some solid hints about OnePlus' upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>.</p><p>The wait won’t be too long, though, as OnePlus is set to drop its device in the first quarter of 2025, right after Oppo’s Find N5 launch in February.</p>
