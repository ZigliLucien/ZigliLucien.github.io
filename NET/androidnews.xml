It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-300W-000mAh-Power-Bank/dp/B0CJY37RT3">now on sale for $118</a>, and I think that&apos;s a terrific price. When I need something smaller, I just use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode 20,000mAh power bank</a> — it goes up to 130W, has adequate charge, and is easily portable (and it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">$60 now</a>).</p><p>The biggest issue with UGREEN power banks (and most other brands) is that they don&apos;t include custom charging tech. While both models I listed above deliver 100W of power over the USB PD standard, they can&apos;t do the same with OnePlus&apos;s 100W SuperVOOC and Vivo&apos;s 120W FlashCharge tech. This is where Anker comes into the equation; the accessory manufacturer picked up a SuperVOOC license back in 2021, and it&apos;s finally putting that to good use.</p><p>Anker&apos;s 27,650mAh Prime Power Bank goes up to 250W in total, and it does 140W via a single port using the USB PD 3.1 standard. But that&apos;s not the most interesting part; it also has a USB-A port that goes up to 65W, delivering 10V at 6.5A. If those figures look familiar, that&apos;s because it corresponds to SuperVOOC&apos;s charging tech. Basically, you can use this power bank&apos;s USB-A port to charge all OnePlus phones at 65W, and that&apos;s a unique differentiator. </p><p>The power bank usually retails for $179, and it has picked up its first discount now, going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">down to $119 on Amazon</a> (with a $10 coupon). That is a terrific value for any power bank in general, but when you consider the addition of SuperVOOC charging, it makes this the best power bank deal around.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want the best power bank money can buy today. Anker&apos;s power bank charges just about any device, and with a 27,650mAh battery, you don&apos;t need to worry about it running out. The obvious highlight is the ability to charge OnePlus devices at 65W, but even if you don&apos;t need it, this is a fantastic power bank.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a smaller power bank.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to like on the Anker Prime 27,650mAh power bank. It has dual USB-C ports, with each able to hit 140W individually over USB PD 3.1. There&apos;s a USB-A port which handles SuperVOOC charging, going up to 65W. With both USB-C ports in use, you get 100W out of one port and 140W out of the other, and it has a total power budget of 250W when all three ports are active.</p><p>It has a vertical design, great build quality, and you get a panel that shows real-time charging details. The power bank recharges the internal battery at 170W, and coming in at 99.5Wh, it is just under the maximum allowed for travel (100Wh). I got started with this power bank three months ago, and honestly, I haven&apos;t felt the need to use anything else.</p><p>I use several OnePlus and OPPO phones, and the ability to charge these devices at 65W via a power bank makes things incredibly convenient. I tested the power bank with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. With any other power bank, these devices charge at 10W, so to be able to go up to 65W is fantastic. </p><p>Even if you don&apos;t have a OnePlus device, this is easily the best power bank you can get today, and the fact that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">down to just $119</a> makes it an instant buy.</p>

With HDD sizes increasing by a considerable amount, I decided to use 18TB and 24TB drives in my NAS, but the secondary NAS (a DiskStation DS1019+) that&apos;s now being used to back up vital data (photos, documents, and so on) is still going strong, and it has 12TB and 16TB IronWolf drives.</p><p>The DS1019+ has been in constant use for the last five years, and the IronWolf drives housed within are close to hitting 40,000 hours of use. When I set up the NAS back in 2019, I had no idea the drives would last this long, and it&apos;s great to see the HDDs exceed Seagate&apos;s usage ceiling. While this NAS is not being used as the primary server any longer, I still have plenty of valuable data on it (which is thankfully backed up elsewhere), and I&apos;m now just interested in seeing how long these drives actually last.</p><p>If you&apos;ve got a home server and are thinking of picking up additional drives, the 12TB IronWolf HDD I&apos;m using is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF">now down to $199 on Amazon</a>. That was what it went down to last year as well, but the deal ran out at the retailer, and if that&apos;s the case, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/seagate-ironwolf-st12000vn0008-12tb/p/1JW-001N-00027">same discount at Newegg</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1634056-REG/seagate_st12000vn0008_12tb_ironwolf_3_5_internal.html">B&H Photo</a>.</p>

<p>A good NAS HDD needs to do two things: store data reliably, and last an extended duration even with 24/7 use. The 12TB IronWolf drive I'm using in the DS1019+ has been in constant use over the last five years, and it's still chugging along without any issues. If that isn't a strong enough endorsement for this drive, I don't know what is.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="caba7d1c-da6e-4c7a-84fb-f6b5a82ca421" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$199 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I think the 8TB IronWolf is a great starting point if you don&apos;t need too much storage, and the drive is a good choice if you have a 2-bay NAS. The drive is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF">now down to $149</a>, which is $10 more than what it was this time last year, but still a decent $30 savings on its retail price. The 12TB drive is my go-to recommendation, and I&apos;ve used four of these over the course of the last five years to good effect.</p><p>The 16TB IronWolf Pro is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B0B94PNF7P">once again down to $249</a>, and if you&apos;re considering this drive, I&apos;d recommend upgrading to the 24TB model instead, which is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CSPCFKR9">better deal at $399</a>. With 24TB of storage on a single drive, you don&apos;t need to worry about storage for several years.</p><p>Regardless of what storage variant you get, all IronWolf drives come with long-term reliability, spin at 7200rpm, and include custom software with vibration resistance — necessary in a NAS server. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF">12TB IronWolf HDD for $199</a> is my pick thanks to the value you&apos;re getting, but I&apos;ve also used the 16TB variants, and I&apos;m now getting started with the 22TB option.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Although it wasn't the first onto the scene, the Razer Edge definitely made a splash as a dedicated Android gaming handheld. While the excitement has fizzled out, that's actually a good thing because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKM287V2"><strong>at less than $215</strong></a>, this is the cheapest we've seen Razer's first and only handheld.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/new-razer-edge-android-cloud-gaming-console">Razer Edge</a> was announced with much excitement, as it's basically an Android tablet paired with the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0CCT2Y8BN">Razer Kishi V2 Pro</a> controller. Not only that, but Razer also utilized a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, complete with a 144Hz refresh rate. Because of its unique design, this means you can actually swap out the controller if you aren't a fan of the V2 Pro, or just upgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CXGMPLWK">Kishi Ultra</a>.</p><p>At the time, it was also one of the more powerful Android devices on the market, courtesy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-g3x-gen-1-gaming-platform-announce">Snapdragon G3X Gen 1</a>, which was essentially a gaming-optimized version of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. With this, you have an all-in-one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handheld</a> that still manages to put at least some of the competition to shame.</p>

<p>The original appeal of the Edge was to provide a dedicated handheld that was great for both cloud gaming and your favorite Android games. Its only major competition was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-launch">Logitech G Cloud</a>, which was severely underpowered, despite offering better ergonomics.</p><p>Part of the problem for Razer was that it kind of fumbled the launch, as it offered two versions: one with Wi-Fi and the other with cellular connectivity. When it was officially introduced, Razer claimed both models would feature the same list of specs, however, it was later revealed that the Wi-Fi model actually featured less RAM.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that the Wi-Fi version originally retailed for $400, so actually, you're saving almost $200 on the Razer Edge. Although the price has hovered around the $250 mark for the better part of the year.</p>

<p>Out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Kindle e-readers</a> today, the Kids Paperwhite Edition (12th Gen) is high up on our list. So far, we've only reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-11th-gen-review">11th-Gen Kindle Paperwhite Kids</a> — it's hard to keep up with every release — but our parent reviewer loved it for its two-month battery life and distraction-free software. The 12th-Gen tablet lasts <em>three</em> months per charge, has the upgraded display tech for better contrast, and adds another 0.2 inches of display space. Basically, what was already great got even better!</p>

<p>The best part of buying either Kindle is that it's limited. Sure, you can buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Pro-Tablet-Hello-Teal-32GB/dp/B0D1DMSV9G"><strong>Kindle Fire HD 8 Kids Pro for 50% off</strong></a> so they can stream content as well as read, but I think it's pretty obvious what'll be more appealing to a kid if both options are presented! Giving them tablet time with an e-reader ensures their brain gets a break from YouTube endorphins, so they can focus on learning and imagination instead!</p><p>That being said, if you want to give your kid the most possible content, from shows to books, the Kindle Fire deals are more affordable at the moment! The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro/dp/B0BL5C43SL"><strong>Fire HD 10 Kids Pro is $80 off ($109)</strong></a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Kids-tablet-Top-selling/dp/B0BL8WSCH3"><strong>Fire 7 Kids is only $54 (50% off)</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you're looking for an easy-to-use smart display that's compatible with the Alexa ecosystem and a wide range of smart home devices; you're looking for something that works with popular streaming channels like Amazon or Apple Music, Prime Video, Netflix, and more;  you want a smart display that's easy to use for video calling.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a smart display that can be rotated, like the Echo Show 10; you're looking for something even more affordable than this deal can offer.</p><p>The 2023 Amazon Echo 8 is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-echo-show">best Amazon Echo Show</a>, featuring everything most users want in a home-integrated smart display. We like this Echo's mid-sized display, its auto-framing camera and noise reduction features for video calling, and the 1,280x800 resolution, which is the same as the 10 but offers a higher pixel ratio per inch. Amazon's Echo Show products also come with a physical camera shutter, as well as a physical off button for the microphone and camera, making it a decent privacy pick compared to some competitors.</p><p>There are a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-echo-show-8-3rd-gen-vs-echo-show-8-2nd-gen">differences between the second and third-gen Echo Show 8 </a>beyond the size, including a slightly faster chipset, a front-facing camera that's built into the center, and spatial audio processing that wasn't included on previous releases. It also features a slightly higher price tag, though that won't be a problem for those taking advantage of this deal.</p><p>The new version also includes support for a wider range of other smart home devices, including those from Zigbee, Matter, and Thread.</p>

In just the past few months, I've gone through about 20 laptops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> combined.

No matter how lightly I'm packing, this 25,000mAh portable charger comes with me. To that end, I've stuck this thing in my back pocket before going into sporting events at Madison Square Garden — that's how much I can't live without it.</p><p>If you're in the market for a power bank, I've got great news: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BJQ7F16T/"><strong>the UGREEN 145 power bank is down to just $66 at Amazon. That's thanks to a 25% off Black Friday deal and a $10 coupon.</strong></a> Considering that this same power bank retailed for $150 when I reviewed it, this makes for one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday and Cyber Monday's</a> most underrated deals. It's so good, I'm not even sure you need to be in the market for a power bank — no one should pass this up.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a high-capacity portable charger; you want a power bank that can charge everything from your earbuds to your phone, tablet, and laptop; you want a versatile and feature-rich charger with multiple ports, port types, and an LED display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a compact and easily-pocketable solution (the UGREEN power bank does fit in some large pant or coat pockets, though it's a tight fit); you want a power bank with wireless charging.</p>
<p>There are a few things that I love about this charger, starting with its size and capacity. It's a 25,000mAh power bank, and when you consider that most phones have a capacity of mAh of around 5,000, that's a ton of power. I can charge most phones at least a few times, and charge tablets and laptops from 0% to 100% with no problems. That means I don't have to stress about charging anymore; I simply make sure the UGREEN 145W power bank is always charged, and it'll take care of all my devices with one USB-A port and two USB-C ports.</p><p>The UGREEN 145W power bank is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best portable chargers</a> out there because it has <em>both </em>capacity and speed. It supports 145W total power delivery, so even power-hungry devices can stay powered up by this charger. Additionally, I think this power bank has the perfect display. It shows the power bank's state-of-charge in simple LED form, which is better than the unnecessary and wasteful LCD screens on some portable chargers.</p><p>Throw it all together, and it's shocking that you get this much power and features in a power bank that can still fit in my back pocket. At $66, I'd recommend anyone who has an Android smartphone or a tablet buy the UGREEN 145W power bank for Black Friday.</p>

<p>Many of the biggest AAA Quest games aren't eligible for the 40% discount, but I've noticed that if you click on a link for full-price games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/assassins-creed-nexus-vr/5812519008825194/">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a>, you may see a 20% "Holiday promotion" pop-up (see the screenshot) for any game if you click on a third-party link. Hopefully these links will work, and you can save a little extra!</p><p>Otherwise, if you're a new or current Quest 3 / Quest 3S owner, check out our guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Quest 3 accessories</a>!

I just left my post to explore Verizon&apos;s Black Friday sale and found a bounty of deals that shouldn&apos;t be missed, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe/"><strong>this offer that gives you a FREE Samsung Galaxy S24 FE when you add a line</strong></a> to your wireless service. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><em><strong>Verizon's Black Friday sale ends soon — check out the full list of deals before it's too late</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>The Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, AND Unlimited Ultimate plans will all earn you enough promo credit to get the phone for free, and you don&apos;t even need to worry about going through the hassle of a trade-in. Some carrier deals have so much fine print that the offer doesn&apos;t even seem worth it. This is <em>not </em>one of those deals.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you love <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> but want something cheaper than the S24 series; you value big AMOLED displays and great battery life; you&apos;re comfortable making a change to your wireless service. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer buying unlocked phones; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity; you can spend a little bit more on a better phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> or standard Galaxy S24. </p><p>The closest thing Samsung produced to a "flagship killer" in 2024, the Galaxy S24 FE boasts a gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED display, an ultra-efficient Exynos chipset, and seven years of OS and security updates. You also get all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that Samsung has been promoting so much lately. </p><p>Indeed, this is a great phone, and this offer from Verizon is a great deal, so why do I feel the need to include an asterisk here? Well, the Galaxy S24 FE suffers from a bit of a pricing problem. At $649.99 retail, it&apos;s too expensive to be considered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, but it&apos;s not quite impressive enough, spec-wise, to earn a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of the year. Instead, the Fan Edition phone sits in an awkward smartphone purgatory, especially when Black Friday sales are currently dropping flagship phones to around the same price (or lower).</p><p>So, what&apos;s the right call here?

<ul><li>Casio unveiled an odd product for the 50th anniversary of the Casio Watch, and it's a ring.</li><li>The "ring-sized version" of a Casio watch costs $120 and is coming in December 2024.</li><li>Initially thought to be a Japan exclusive, the ring watch was recently spotted on Casio's US store, confirming a stateside release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>When we first heard about Casio's upcoming ring watch, we thought it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/casio-smart-ring-gimmicky-design-may-show-future-smart-rings-sort-of">akin to an April Fool's joke</a>. However, it turns out that the Casio CRW-001-1JR isn't entirely a Japan exclusive. The Casio CRW001-1 is the exact same as the CRW-001-1JR, except it'll be available in the US starting next month at a retail price of $120 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24308313/casios-ring-watch-is-coming-to-the-us-for-120" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>It's an interesting concept, to say the least, and this "ring watch" is exactly what it sounds like. It's a ring-sized version of Casio's classic watches designed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Casio Watch. And although it's a strange product — it has none of the modern smart watch features you're probably familiar with — it took a lot of clever engineering to get here.</p><p>The Casio CRW001-1 is made entirely out of metal, and Casio says it had to use special processes to use injection-molding to create a unified case, case back, and ring. At the same time, it's still a traditional watch, so the battery still needs to be replaced. That's why Casio used a unique glass adhesive method to create a water-resistant seal that still makes it possible to replace the battery.</p><p>Speaking of battery life, it's claimed to last two years and simply uses a SR621SW button battery, and can be replaced. In a way, that makes the Casio CRW001-1 more repairable than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> — and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> — you can buy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WpFQxZzWZ4sPi8pmBrniRm" name="Casio-smart-ring-press-photo-1" alt="A press photo showing a person wearing the Casio CRW-001-1JR smart ring on their index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpFQxZzWZ4sPi8pmBrniRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Casio)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the end of the day, you have to wonder if Casio saw the weirdly-positive reception to the Casio CRW-001-1JR and decided to bring it to the US — or if this was always part of the plan. With a $120 price, it's expensive for what it is, but isn't actually that overpriced when you consider the going rates for rings, watches, and collectibles.</p><p>This is clearly a novelty item, but with a December 2024 release, it could make for a great gift for a gadget-lover. I know it's something that I'd want in my personal collection, even if I probably wouldn't replace my smartwatch or smart ring for it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A while ago, I saw a video on TikTok from an influencer that absolutely sent my brain into a spiral.</p><p>SamDoll, who is the influencer, went on a rant about how she bought the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> and absolutely hated it. Her rant was infuriating and actually really upset me because not only was she speaking without much knowledge about the actual ring, but she also has the capability of influencing her nearly one million followers.</p><p>While she did make some accurate points <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sam_d0ll/video/7401947251007933702">in her video</a>, I genuinely did not agree with what she was saying for the most part. It made me realize how important it is that I reiterate to you, our valued readers, how important it is to not get sucked into what regular, everyday influencers say about tech products.</p>

<p>More importantly, as you spend your hard-earned money on products this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/black-friday-smartwatch-deal-hunters-should-look-at-smart-rings-instead">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday weekend, then you should be looking to read reviews from trusted sites like Android Central. If you are keen on listening to what influencers say, then you should follow tech influencers who take particular interest in providing the best information that is relevant to help you understand products. <br><br>On that note, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-gen-3-black-friday-cyber-monday-2024-deal">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> is the wearable that pretty much kicked off the smart ring craze, and its best style is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">up to $100 off</a> depending on the color you want, making it a good alternative if you want a great smart ring without breaking the bank.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="ZeL4osJY3BrAb3RHRpgZ9X" name="Oura-app-v6.jpg" alt="Oura app tabs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZeL4osJY3BrAb3RHRpgZ9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the main points that SamDoll makes in her video is how the ring keeps telling her a lot of information that she doesn’t understand, and she also claims that the ring isn’t doing the job right.</p><p>In one example, she complains about how she felt like she had a horrible night’s sleep, but when she woke up, the ring indicated her Readiness Score (but she inaccurately calls it recovery) was at 80 percent. <br><br>What SamDoll didn’t include in this portion of the video is what the Oura Ring Readiness score is and what it is based on:<br><br>“Your Readiness Score reflects how balanced your recovery and activity are. It looks at your sleep quality, body signals, and activity levels to show how prepared you are to take on the day,” according to the Oura website. It is not just based on how well you sleep. Even if you had poor sleep, your body throughout the day could have recovered well.</p><p>When you do not express to your nearly one million followers what the ring actually is collecting and how it contributes to the overall score, you’re providing inaccurate information because they’re not getting the whole picture.</p><p>It deters a user from wanting to buy something because they trust what you are saying. That is why it is important to ensure you, our valuable reader, are going to trusted sources who take a lot of time to test products to give you the information you need.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's worldwide device trackers, reiterated the importance of experience.</p><p>“Advice from experts is simply more valuable and enlightening and consumers should focus on that. However, the reality is that anyone with a loud enough voice can make or break a product, so it’s in companies’ best interest to also collaborate with influencers outside of tech,” he said.</p>
<h2 id="the-oura-ring-is-not-for-fitness-it-is-for-your-health-2">The Oura Ring is not for fitness, it is for your health </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-colors.jpg" alt="Four Oura Rings in different finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1192" height="671" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SamDoll, later in her video, expresses her distaste for how the ring doesn’t automatically detect her workout, and when she plugged her workout into the ring app, it didn’t provide her with accurate information on how many calories she burned.</p><p>In the initial stages of the Oura Ring, which, in my experience, is the gold standard of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a>, it took a while for the ring to actually detect and accurately provide workout information.</p><p>That since has changed and is incredibly accurate. Android Central’s managing editor, Derrek Lee, has noted how the ring is great at detecting common activities like walking and running. He had expressed to me about a time when he went out with friends dancing, and the ring, later on, indicated that he had some activity and labeled it as dancing, something it has accurately deduced on more than one occasion.</p><p>While he often manually tracks workouts with the ring, it will sometimes automatically detect more ambiguous activities like high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and yoga.</p><p>But that being said, I don’t actually think the Oura Ring is for fitness; rather, it’s meant to be an overall health tracker and monitor. I think the purpose of the ring is to help you understand your body, and as such, I actually think it would be better paired with another wearable like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> if your desire is to monitor fitness.</p><p>Ubrani agrees, adding that a smart ring is a “replacement for the health-related aspects of smartwatches.”</p>

<p>While SamDoll made a lot of claims in her video that I did not agree with—and there were more than what I detail in this article—I did agree with her on one major point.</p><p>She expressed how the Oura Ring is already an expensive device (starting at US$299), which it is. But to top it off, if you really want the best experience with the ring, you need to pay an additional $5.99 before tax per month for the subscription service. Granted, the subscription service does come with a lot of features like the following:</p>
<ul><li>Detailed sleep analysis</li><li>24/7 heart rate tracking (Daytime, Nighttime, Activity)</li><li>Integration with third-party health and wellness apps like Strava</li><li>Advanced temperature monitoring</li><li>Blood Oxygen Sensing (SpO2)</li><li>Cardiovascular Age</li><li>Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max)</li><li>Cycle Insights</li><li>Daytime Stress</li><li>Dynamic activity goals with Automatic Activity Detection</li><li>Oura Labs</li><li>Pregnancy Insights</li><li>Resilience</li><li>Weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, and anniversary reports</li></ul>
<p>But that’s a lot of money, especially when no other company that produces a smart ring requires an additional paid subscription to enjoy the ring (even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-gets-permanent-price-drop-and-free-subscriptions">Amazfit got rid of its subscription</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Helio Ring</a>). Basically, all the most useful Oura Ring features are hidden behind a paywall.</p><p>I strongly urge Oura to rethink this idea, as it can also be a deterrent for users who may consider buying a smart ring. That said, Oura explains that it does this because it uses the money to invest in its features and its technology. This is why we see the ring constantly getting new features, even years after the Gen 3 launched.</p>

<p>Oura has been around for many years, and we do know that the company strives to do more to help people with their health, which it has proven with the newer and excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>.</p><p>Like me, Ubrani also agrees that the ring is the gold standard for smart rings only because the company has done a “great job in offering a very polished and well-rounded experience for users, which in turn has set a high bar for competition.”</p><p>Oura has been able to do this only because they had a massive lead up in the market, also providing them much more time to refine the experience of the ring.</p><p>But more importantly, I think, in general, if you’re going to buy something during Black Friday or Cyber Monday, try to do more homework than just relying on one creator.</p>
