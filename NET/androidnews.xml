<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-december-2024-feature-drop-announced">final Pixel update of the year</a> teased Emoji Kitchen changes for Gboard, and now we’re finally seeing them in action.</p><p>Gboard’s redesigned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gboard-emoji-mashups-and-how-create-your-own">Emoji Kitchen</a> introduces a top-row suggestion bar in the Emoji tab, replacing the old recent creations list, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/09/gboard-emoji-kitchen-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This handy tweak makes it super easy to explore fun emoji combos by just tapping a suggestion.</p><p>The update also makes Emoji Kitchen more accessible with a new arrow that opens an expanded "Browse" screen. Here, you’ll find tons of emoji pairings—including quirky ones as shown below. It’s a quicker, easier way to create stickers without scrolling endlessly.</p>

<p>This feature is perfect for anyone who values speed and wants to skip the trial-and-error hassle.</p><p>Furthermore, tapping on any emoji combo lets you break it down into the two originals. Plus, there’s a new history button in the top-right corner for quick access to your favorite or recent mashups. This redesign keeps the top suggestion bar clean and focused on fresh emoji ideas instead of past creations.</p><p>A new floating action button in the bottom-right corner gives quick access to the emoji picker. Pick an emoji, and you’ll see a full list of combo options using that emoji as the base. It makes creating unique emoji mashups way easier.</p><p>The changes might fly under the radar for casual users, but for Emoji Kitchen regulars, they make a big difference in how smoothly everything works.</p><p>The revamped Emoji Kitchen is rolling out as a server-side update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a> beta users on version 14.8. It’s not available for stable users yet, but it’s expected to reach all Android phones, not just Pixels, eventually.</p>

But that hasn't been the case in the last two years, with Xiaomi changing focus to the mid-range category. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12 Pro+</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro+</a> had gorgeous designs and decent hardware, they just didn't deliver on the value side of things, and the increase in price meant they didn't quite have the same mainstream likeability.</p><p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is much the same; it costs just as much as its predecessor, but you get better cameras and powerful hardware. The battery life is where you'll see the biggest difference, with the device featuring a massive 6200mAh battery that easily lasts two days between charges. <br><br>However, Xiaomi hasn't done enough on the software side of things. The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and that just isn't good enough on a mid-range phone at the end of 2024. What's even more annoying is that the device will get just three Android OS updates, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> — which it should have launched with — counts as one. <br><br>While the hardware is arguably better, the software situation continues to be a real problem for Xiaomi, and the brand doesn't seem to care about it — at least not enough to do change its strategy.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi Note 14 series in Q3 2024, and the phones made their global debut in India on December 9. The Redmi Note 14 and 14 Pro are the affordable models in the series, with the Note 14 Pro+ delivering the best hardware and cameras. <br><br>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ starts at ₹30,999 ($365) in India for the variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the 8GB/256GB model costs ₹32,999 ($390). There's also a 12GB/512GB edition that's available for ₹35,999 ($425), and all three variants are available in all three color options — blue, black, and purple — so that's good to see. <br><br>Xiaomi accelerated the launch timeline in India, with the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ debuting a month earlier than its predecessor. There's no telling when the phone will be available in the U.K. and other global markets, but if I had to venture a guess, it'd be sometime in January.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-14-pro-design"><span>Redmi Note 14 Pro+: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GWBwWcxVAhYVdRH5HNkMuS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWBwWcxVAhYVdRH5HNkMuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's clear that design is a key area of focus for Xiaomi, and the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is one of the best-looking devices in this category. In fact, I actually like this design more than that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>; the smooth curves makes the device look elegant, and you don't feel like you're using a mid-range phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XrKnPRVckGiWbZcmNEB9yS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus back leather view with Redmi logo highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XrKnPRVckGiWbZcmNEB9yS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The color I'm using is particularly great, as it has a vegan leather back — the other two models have a regular glass back instead. The leather finish feels great, and there's a stitched pattern that gives the phone a little extra character. There's a new camera island at the back as well, and like the rest of the design, it looks clean and elegant. This area is often an afterthought on most Xiaomi devices, so it's good to see the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ getting a module that accentuates the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rY55FCy8xCQe4Je98J2wyS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus camera housing at the back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rY55FCy8xCQe4Je98J2wyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi did the right things with material choices as well, with the device featuring an aluminum mid-frame that gives it additional rigidity. The sides have a glossy coat, and while you get symmetric curves, there's still enough width at the sides to hold the device. The sides are color-matched to the back, and again, it makes the device that a bit more upmarket.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AR3zHgcgirq3jwMuPqRemS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus side view with power button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AR3zHgcgirq3jwMuPqRemS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons have good tactility, and I didn't see any problems in this area. The only issue I have is that the in-screen module sits a little lower on the screen, making it awkward to access one-handed; this is true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and several other devices I tested recently, so Xiaomi isn't the only brand doing this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cMaJHGRJdGLWJxdpoe6NpS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus IR blaster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMaJHGRJdGLWJxdpoe6NpS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is 6g heavier than its predecessor, you get a significantly bigger 6200mAh battery. Honestly, I didn't notice the added heft, and Xiaomi did a good job with the weight distribution. The in-hand feel is similarly great, and the phone isn't bulky or unwieldy in the least. <br><br>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ retains IP68 ingress protection as well, giving it added resilience against dust and water. Overall, Xiaomi did all the right things with the design of the Redmi Note 14 Pro+, and it doesn't end up looking like a mid-ranger.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-14-pro-display"><span>Redmi Note 14 Pro+: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Q7vzzZtgNeRiG9qbTkbkwS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus home page with colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q7vzzZtgNeRiG9qbTkbkwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ uses the same 6.67-inch panel size as last year, but it gets much brighter, and it gets Gorilla Glass Victus 2 as standard. You get the usual 120Hz refresh and a resolution of 2712 x 1220, but Xiaomi uses the dynamic mode out of the box, so you'll need to go into the settings to enable 120Hz.</p>
<p>Xiaomi usually does a good job with color calibration, but my unit had cooler colors out of the box; thankfully, it's easy to adjust color balance via the settings. Other than that, I didn't notice any issues with the panel as such — it has good contrast and vibrancy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pBeHtMTm5H6HUgTZ3fjFtS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBeHtMTm5H6HUgTZ3fjFtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no problems using the panel outdoors; it gets sufficiently bright, and there's a slight difference from the Note 13 Pro+ in this regard. That said, the ambient brightness sensor is a little slow to adjust brightness, and I found myself having to use the brightness slider to manually adjust it several times.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EyqdUaTwhmgzMLi3nQUkwS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EyqdUaTwhmgzMLi3nQUkwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it won't win any awards, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ holds up well during gaming, but you will notice jitter in demanding titles. Video streaming is good enough; there's HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, but switching to HDR content in YouTube made the video jittery at times. Outside of that, colors looked great, and there wasn't any excessive blooming. <br><br>Like previous years, you get stereo sound, and it's detailed enough that you can use the onboard audio if you're listening to a podcast. There's 1920Hz PWM dimming, and you get a decent amount of configurability when it comes to always-on styles.</p>

<p>After using MediaTek-powered designs for the last three years, Xiaomi is back to using Qualcomm in the Redmi Note 14 Pro+. The phone is powered by the latest Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 platform, and it has a higher-clocked Adreno 710 and is manufactured on the 4nm node. <br><br>Given that Qualcomm was slow to switch to the latest Arm cores in the past, it's good to see the use of Cortex A720 and A520 cores this time. I noticed some lag at times — particularly when switching between a video and a game — but outside of that, there weren't any issues in regular use.</p>

<p>The phone does a good job with gaming as well, but it tends to be aggressive with thermal management, so you will see throttling in extended gaming sessions. There isn't much in the way of overheating, but you will see the occasional lag and jitter in demanding games; turning down the settings makes a difference. <br><br>Xiaomi is selling the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ in 8GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB, and 12GB/512GB configurations, and annoyingly, all storage modules of the device come with UFS 3.1 and not UFS 4.0. You miss out on Wi-Fi 6E as well, but there is Bluetooth 5.4 and NFC. I didn't see any issues with connectivity or calling, and I got a reliable cellular signal. <br><br>There's a new x-axis vibration motor, and while it doesn't deliver the same level of granular feedback as the Xiaomi 14, it is decent enough in its own right — considering how much you're paying for the phone.</p>

<p>One of the best features of the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is the significantly bigger 6200mAh battery. What's particularly great is that Xiaomi slotted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery</a>, so you get much better density, and the phone can withstand extreme cold without any issues. It's great to see brands bringing this tech to the mid-range segment. <br><br>The increased battery size gives the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ a distinct advantage, and the phone manages to last two days without any issues. Even with heavy use, I only had to charge the device every other day, so if you need a phone with the best battery life in this segment, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is the one to get. <br><br>You also get 90W charging, and Xiaomi bundles the requisite charger in the box. It takes just over 65 minutes to fully charge the device, and that's not bad considering the size of the battery. Xiaomi has the usual battery safeguards to extend longevity, including charging limit and optimized charging.</p>

<p>After using 200MP cameras, Xiaomi is once again back to a 50MP main camera on the Redmi Note 14 Pro+, and the device features OmniVision's OVX8000 module, dubbed the Light Hunter 800 by Xiaomi. This is the same sensor that's used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-poco-f6-pro-is-the-most-underrated-phone-of-2024">POCO F6 Pro</a>, Xiaomi 14 Civi, and even the Xiaomi Mix Flip, so the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is in good company in this regard. <br><br>In a similar vein, Xiaomi added a 50MP Samsung JN1 telephoto lens at the back with 2.5x optical zoom, and this makes the phone much more versatile. After years and years of ineffectual auxiliary cameras, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ gets usable auxiliary cameras, and the 8MP wide-angle lens is decent enough in its own right. <br><br>However, Xiaomi is yet to address long-standing issues with video recording on the Redmi Note series; the phone still doesn't get 4K60 video, and what's even more annoying is that it doesn't even have 60fps at 1080p when using the wide-angle lens. The camera interface itself is unchanged in four years, so if you've used a Xiaomi or POCO phone in the past, you'll be familiar with all the settings.</p>

<p>Thanks to the new sensor, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ takes fantastic photos in any situation. Daylight shots have great detail and dynamic range, and accurate colors. You don't get overly saturated images, and foliage rendition is detailed without any aggressive smoothing. The camera does a fantastic job in low-light situations as well, providing good color vibrancy and plenty of detail, and no visible noise levels. It takes a smidgen longer to focus in low-light than high-end phones, but that's about the only shortcoming I noticed. <br><br>The telephotos lens is a good addition at the back, and it produces usable shots at up to 5x zoom. There's no OIS, and it may take a few tries to get the ideal shot, but again, the inclusion of a dedicated zoom lens is a big differentiator. The camera isn't quite as good in low-light, but you still get shots that are decent enough for sharing on social media. You get decent portraits as well, and while you can't adjust the focal length, there's a marked difference over the 13 Pro+. <br><br>The wide-angle lens is better than previous years, and while it doesn't measure up to the likes of the Xiaomi 14, it definitely holds its own against other mid-rangers. To sum up, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ has a versatile camera system that takes great images in most conditions, and it is right up there with the best in this category.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nCTtxpjiJn5omwJKRnwDtS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus Android Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCTtxpjiJn5omwJKRnwDtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ comes with Android 14 out of the box, even though Google rolled out the stable version of Android nearly two months prior to the launch of the phone. Xiaomi's software interface needs an overhaul; the design is four years old at this point, and it's starting to show its age. <br><br>The UI has better fluidity than MIUI skins of yesteryear, and you get a decent amount of customizability. That said, ColorOS and Funtouch OS have better features in this area, and they're optimized much better. You also get plenty of bloatware, and while most of it can be uninstalled, it's annoying that Xiaomi hasn't addressed this yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5scT4zZpiEnAF6mNTCyUxS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5scT4zZpiEnAF6mNTCyUxS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of delivering the latest Android version, Xiaomi focused its attention on AI-assisted utilities, and like every other phone today, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ has a suite of AI tools with questionable usability. Circle to Search and AI-backed transcribing of audio recordings are useful, but I didn't see the utility of AI summaries and translate features baked into the Notes client. <br><br>Gallery has an AI-assisted object eraser, a tool that increases the size of the frame, and one that generates short video highlights from your photos. There's an AI translator and AI subtitles as well, and the main problem is that none of these are available out of the box — they'll be rolling out via software updates down the line. Given Xiaomi's track record at delivering timely updates, I wouldn't hold my breath. <br><br>Then there's the issue with system updates. Xiaomi is guaranteeing three Android OS updates and four years of security updates, but the problem is that Android 15 counts towards one of those updates, and that's just an underhanded move. Xiaomi does this intentionally so it doesn't have to bother with long-term updates down the line, and this practice alone makes me not want to recommend the device.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> is my go-to recommendation in this segment, with the device offering a terrific combination of hardware and battery life. The camera isn't as good as the Redmi Note 14 Pro+, but it comes close, and it does a much better job at gaming. The battery lasts a day and a half, and coming in at ₹29,999 ($353), you get a much better value. <br><br>Obviously, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> continues to be a terrific choice, and while it is costlier at ₹35,999 ($425), you get a better phone in just about every area. The AMOLED panel gets brighter, the phone is significantly faster in regular use, and the main camera takes better photos in just about any scenario. <br><br>Nothing's Phone 2a Plus is also an intriguing choice to consider. It has a distinctive design, great software features, and two usable cameras at the back. And starting at ₹26,999 ($318), you're not paying a hefty premium.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a good-looking mid-range phone</li><li>You want great cameras at the back</li><li>You need the best battery life in this category</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want good software with meaningful extras</li><li>You need long-term updates</li><li>You want a phone that takes good videos</li></ul>
<p>I tested every Redmi Note phone released in the last decade, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to these devices. While the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is costlier than earlier phones that came in the series, there isn't a price hike this year, and that's a good thing. <br><br>The hardware is really rather good, and the cameras are great — the inclusion of a telephoto lens gives it a decent edge, and that's no small feat in this category. The battery life is easily the best I've used on any mid-ranger, and it doesn't take long to charge the battery either. <br><br>But like the last two years, it's the software that ultimately limits the device. If you don't have an issue with the fact that the phone comes with Android 14 out of the box, then yes, the Redmi Note Pro 14+ is a decent choice. But the software makes a bigger difference in how long you can actually the phone, and in this area, Xiaomi is once again found to be lacking.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for holiday deals on Android devices, you&apos;ve come to the right place: a bunch of our favorite tech from Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and beyond is currently being discounted across the web, and I&apos;ve collected the best Android Central-approved options into this guide. </p><p>It was an interesting year for Android! AI took center stage, Android 15 dropped, and it felt like just about every OEM under the sun decided to release its own foldable phone. The OnePlus 12 even overtook Samsung and Google as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">our favorite Android phone</a> of the year! Now that we&apos;re nearing the new year, retailers are ditching their old stock to make room for the next generation, so it&apos;s a great time to shop for deals. </p><p>The holiday deals on display include discounts like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>$500 off the Google Pixel 9 at Mint Mobile</strong></a> when you add an eligible line, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0D84MHZX5/"><strong>this offer that drops a whopping 15% off the brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus</strong></a>. Most of these deals should arrive by Christmas if you place your order today, but I&apos;ll make a note if I think that&apos;s going to be a concern. Either way, we&apos;re getting down to the wire, so act fast if something catches your eye! </p>

<ul><li>Google Docs added 40 new pageless templates aimed to help users "build high-quality, modern documents faster.</li><li>The new templates cover blog posts, press releases, business proposals, and journals, as well as specialized options for business and education Workspace users.</li><li>Google previously added similar modernized templates to Slides last month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's latest addition to Workspace is a set of 40 new pageless templates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-is-tapping-into-gemini-to-whip-up-formatted-documents">Google Docs</a> that are available starting today. The company announced the new templates, which come with integrated Docs features, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/new-templates-in-google-docs.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Google says these are "high-quality, visually modern designs" that can be useful in a variety of situations, with specialized options for enterprise and education users.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-for-android-defaults-to-paginated-mode">pageless templates</a> feature document tabs and placeholder chips, two Google Docs features that were previously available. Document tabs help organize long documents into easily-digestible and navigable sections. Meanwhile, placeholder chips aim to simplify workflows by making it easy to fill in documents with people, dates, files, events, and places.</p><p>Aside from document tabs and placeholder chips, the 40 new templates are outfitted with custom designs, fonts, and structures. Google explains that there are templates for blog posts, press releases, business proposals, and journals, as well as specialized options such as:</p>
<ul><li>A project roadmap, marketing plan, and sales emails for <strong>business users. </strong></li><li>An interview guide, onboarding guide, and training manual for <strong>human resource teams. </strong></li><li>A reading list and class notes templates for <strong>education users. </strong></li></ul>

<p>There are a few ways to add a template to a new Google Doc, starting with a new <strong>Templates</strong> building block that will appear at the top of a blank document. Alternatively, you can choose a template by navigating through <strong>File > New > From template gallery</strong> in the Google Docs toolbar.</p><p>These new templates are available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">all Google Workspace users</a>, though it may take some time for them to show up for everyone. Both rapid release and scheduled release domains are starting to see these 40 new templates starting today, but the rollout can take up to 15 days to complete.</p><p>Google says that users can expect "even more high-quality Docs template options in the coming months."</p>

<ul><li>A rumor on Weibo claims the Galaxy S25 series could support the new Qi2 wireless charging standard, launched in 2023.</li><li>It was stated that the method would only a charging strength of 15W on the S25 series, which is what Qi Power stated during its launch.</li><li>Qi2 support was originally expected for the Galaxy S24 series; however, the only phone (and first) to adopt it is the HMD Skyline.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent Galaxy S25 post spreads rumors about its potential (exciting) upgrade to its charging capabilities.</p><p>The rumors were reportedly started by Ice Universe on Weibo and highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1866139989215760439">Jukanlosreve</a> on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-qi2-magsafe-charging-accessories-rumor/">SamMobile</a>). Per the tipster, the Galaxy S25 series will supposedly utilize the new wireless charging standard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2</a>. Ice Universe supposedly discussed these details over private messages on Weibo.</p><p>The tipster added that the S25 series will support this method; however, devices charging wirelessly may only see 15W capabilities.</p><p>The stated charging strength isn't surprising as Qi Power announced as much when the Qi2 standard was launched late in November 2023.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ice Universe: The S25 series will feature Qi2.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1866139989215760439">December 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Qi2 met a late 2023 holiday season launch and the Wireless Power Consortium highlighted its roots in Apple's MagSafe technology. It's worth mentioning that the tech hit the iPhone 15 series <em>before </em>Qi2 got around to Android devices. Qi Power "promised" that its new standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">could provide</a> "greater energy efficiency, faster charging, and enhanced convenience" for Android.</p><p>Accessory manufacturers like Belkin, Mophie, Anker, and Aircharge entered certification to prepare for a market launch shortly after Qi2 was launched. We were excited, considering this meant Android phones could finally adopt its wireless charging method.</p><p>However, that has yet to happen — at least, in a widespread fashion. The first (and only) Android to support Qi2 wireless charging is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">the HMD Skyline</a>.</p><p>It was also expected that Samsung would jump on this new wireless charging trend, but it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">dropped the ball with the Galaxy S24</a>. Instead, what we received was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">S Pen malfunctions</a> with Qi2 magnet accessories, as noted by manufacturers trying to craft their latest products.</p><p>Qi2 is still a viable option for Samsung to deploy on its upcoming Galaxy S25 series. Though Android Central's Namerah Saud Fatmi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-samsung-galaxy-s24-series">said the method</a> would keep the S24 series "exciting and alive," the same can probably be shifted over to the S25 flagship trio.</p><p>As always, we'll have to wait and see. The Galaxy S25 series is expected to launch during Galaxy Unpacked in January 2025.</p>

<p>Chickens are wonderful, lovable pets. I heartily recommend them to anyone who has space and is allowed to keep them, but they do require a fair bit of work. While they're certainly capable of taking care of themselves throughout the day — heck, they actually put themselves to bed at sundown — ensuring something doesn't eat them is practically a full-time job.</p><p>In the nearly six years since I've started keeping chickens, my flock has grown substantially. What started as three hens turned into 11, and while I've lost a few over the years to disease, it's nearly impossible to resist the urge to get new chicks every spring.</p><p>During that time, I've discovered many ways to keep my chickens safe and my caretaking job easier, most of which involve smart home devices I've either cobbled together or found along the way. Even if you don't have chickens, some of these ideas might be helpful for your other pets, especially if you'll be away from home on vacation during the holidays.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-day-the-automated-way-2">Starting the day the automated way</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mGpLEivWQeaxxyxY4x3PJi" name="Omlet-automatic-chicken-coop-door" alt="An Omlet Automatic Chicken Coop Door in the open position" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mGpLEivWQeaxxyxY4x3PJi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To prevent a predator-caused disaster, chickens have to be locked up at night. When we got our first three hens back in 2019, we kept them in an enclosed run at all times, so keeping the door closed at night wasn't important unless it was freezing outside.</p><p>But as our flock, coop, and run size grew, it made more sense to let them free range during the day. Of course, this introduces a number of potential issues, including waking up at the crack of dawn.</p><p>As the sun rises in the morning, my Omlet Automatic Chicken Coop Door opens by itself once the right amount of light hits its sensor. The latest version of the door connects to Wi-Fi and has an app that allows me to see if it's open or closed, plus remotely open and close it manually if I need to.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.30%;"><img id="vVQhbW7CK8YSaaqMeiGhfn" name="smart-home-chicken-coop-screenshots" alt="Screenshots of smart chicken coop apps including Omlet automatic door, Blink camera with temperature sensor, and Google Home with a Kasa Matter smart plug" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVQhbW7CK8YSaaqMeiGhfn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1235" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I specifically chose the Omlet brand because it not only has a great reputation for build quality and reliability, but I also preferred the design and safety measures built into the product.</p><p>Lots of automated chicken coop doors use what I call a guillotine-style store; they open and close vertically, and I can pretty easily imagine one of my hens sticking her head in it at just the wrong moment. Omlet's door slides side-to-side like a sliding glass door and features pressure-sensitive sensors that ensure errant hens sitting in the doorway don't get crushed.</p><p>The model I have has the option to use batteries or plug into an outlet, but the downside is that you have to choose one <em>or</em> the other. If you plug a plug into it, it bypasses battery power. I wish they would update it with the ability to plug it in and keep batteries as a backup for when power goes out.</p>
<p>You may not have chickens, but it's likely you might have another pet that needs to go outside from time to time. Whether it's a cat, dog, bunny, or something else entirely, an automated door like this could be a great solution for when you're away.</p><p>I've also got several cameras posted around the backyard, including in the coop and chicken run. This lets me check up on them throughout the day, make <em>sure</em> the door is opened or closed, and keep an eye on their food and water situation.</p>

<p>One of my all-time favorite smart gadgets for my chicken coop is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-4th-Gen-1-Camera/dp/B0B1N5HW22/">Blink Outdoor cameras</a>. Blink is notable for its cost and long battery life (up to 2 years on a pair of AA batteries), but I love it specifically for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.blinkforhome.com/en_US/camera-settings/how-to-enable-temperature-alerts">temperature sensor inside</a>.</p><p>Each battery-powered Blink camera has a temperature sensor that you can monitor from the Blink app. Since my chicken coop is, well, outside, it's important for me to be able to monitor the temperature throughout the year. If it's getting too hot, I swap out the solid wood coop door for a more ventilated one to allow for additional breeze in the summer.</p><p>In the winter, the camera helps me keep track of how cold it is in the coop so I can turn on the heater as needed. I've got a ceramic heater designed for chicken coops (it mounts on the wall inside) plugged into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kasa-Smart-Monitoring-Compact-Certified/dp/B0BYGMR4DX/">Kasa Matter Smart Plug</a>, so I can turn it on and off remotely via the Google Home app or through voice commands.</p>

<p>It looks like Amazon sells smart heaters <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/petnf-Chicken-Efficient-UL-Compliant-11-81x15-74/dp/B0D8QBKMWK/" target="_blank">that directly connect to Wi-Fi</a> these days, but my solution is quite ideal if you've already got the heater and just need a way to remotely control it.</p><p>We've also got heaters for our waterers hooked up to separate smart plugs since those waterers are in the run, not in the coop. I've got another Blink camera mounted in the chicken run that monitors the outdoor temperature and can send me alerts for when it drops below freezing, triggering the chicken waterer heater to turn on.</p><p>While I've reduced the number of smart light bulbs throughout my home because most of them use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, I've increased the number of smart appliances and plugs so I can automate and remotely control things to give me and my animals the best life possible.</p><p>One of these days, I'll get the Homey set up and further automate things but, for now, it's amazing to be able to remotely monitor and manage the coop when I'm out of town for the holidays or on one of the many business trips I take throughout the year.</p>

<ul><li>The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently finalized a rule that would place Google's payment services under federal supervision.</li><li>While supervision doesn't mean a particular company has engaged in wrongdoing, it does identify that it poses "risks to consumers."</li><li>Google is claiming that the basis for supervision, complaints regarding Google Pay, shouldn't stand since the service was shuttered in the US, and is no longer available.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau aims to supervise non-bank payment apps, mostly hosted by big tech companies, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-finalizes-rule-to-supervise-apps-like-google-wallet">a finalized rule set to take effect next month</a>. Corporations that handle more than 50 million transactions per year will be subject to supervision, including the likes of Apple, Google, and Amazon. But one company, Google, is trying to block the move with a lawsuit filed last week, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/google-pushes-back-against-federal-supervision-of-its-payment-arm/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.</p><p>The CFPB is targeting non-bank companies that host wallet apps and digital payment services because the body wants these corporations to follow the same rules, and supervisory examinations, as banks and credit unions. The Bureau claims it "always had enforcement authority over these companies." Now, the official rule gives it the explicit authority to conduct proactive examinations of these non-bank companies hosting such services.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-regulator-places-google-payment-corp-under-supervision-2024-12-06/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports that the CFPB took nearly 300 customer complaints into consideration when it determined Google's payment services posed "risks to consumers." It's important to note, however, that this does not mean the company has engaged in wrongdoing. Google Payment Corp., a subsidiary, failed to investigate customer complaints regarding errors and other violations, according to the CFPB.</p><p>Google Payment Corp., meanwhile, is suing on the basis that the CFPB's designation relied on "a small number of unsubstantiated complaints" about Google Pay, which is no longer offered in the US, per Reuters. "As a matter of common sense, a product that no longer exists is incapable of posing such risk," the company wrote in the filing.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">Google Pay was discontinued in the US in June</a>, and Google no longer offers peer-to-peer payment services in the country. However, some Google Pay offerings — such as contactless digital payments at retailers — are now available as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet app</a>. Even though Google Pay is discontinued, the CFPB's rule says it requires oversight.</p><p>"Even when firms choose to discontinue offering payments to other consumers, or have not yet enabled that capability in the United States," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/10/2024-27836/defining-larger-participants-of-a-market-for-general-use-digital-consumer-payment-applications" target="_blank">rule</a> explains, "their general-use digital payment applications still comprise part of the overall market described in the Final Rule, which includes but is not limited to digitally facilitating consumer payment transactions for purchases."</p><p>The rule was published in the Federal Register today, and will take effect on Jan. 9, 2025.</p><p>"This is a clear case of government overreach involving Google Pay peer-to-peer payments, which never raised risks and is no longer provided in the U.S., and we are challenging it in court," a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><p>As Google's lawsuit begins, there are a number of questions whether the CFPB's plan to supervise non-bank digital payment services will continue when President-elect Donald Trump's administration takes over next year. Under President Biden, the CFPB aggressively sought to make new rules, and this effort has reportedly continued even after Trump's election victory in November.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's assumed XCover 8 Pro has appeared in the SafetyKorea database for battery certification.</li><li>The phone is listed with a 4,350mAh battery, which is a 300mAh upgrade over the previous two generations of rugged phones.</li><li>Samsung was reportedly developing two new Pro-level rugged devices, a phone and a tablet, in October, and rumors state both could debut in mid-2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Samsung has another rugged phone in the works, but this one could improve one key element.</p><p>A Samsung device was spotted in the SafetyKorea certification database by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-xcover-8-pro/">GalaxyClub</a> (Dutch), which is assumed to be a new rugged smartphone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_xcover8_pro_battery_certified_with_higher_capacity-news-65681.php">GSMArena</a>). According to the listing, it appears that the next device is the XCover  8 Pro. The publication spotted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.safetykorea.kr/release/certDetail?certNum=XU102099-24104&certUid=5902500">uploaded photo</a> detailing the device's battery information.</p><p>Per the listing, it seems the XCover 8 Pro will debut with a lithium-ion battery capacity of 4,350mAh.</p><p>The listing also states that this battery will not be built into the phone when it launches. It seems consumers might expect a removable battery once again in the XCover 8 Pro, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-announcement">XCover 6 Pro</a> and 7.</p><p>The publication reiterated the rumored existence of another rugged tablet from Samsung. The listing lacks any further information concerning a launch; however, the post speculates the OEM could launch the XCover 8 Pro (and potentially the tablet) in mid-2025.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-launches-galaxy-xcover7-its-first-ever-enterprise-exclusive-smartphone-the-perfect-blend-of-military-grade-durability-work-continuity-and-productivity">launched</a> the XCover 7 earlier this year with a 6.6-inch FHD Plus display with one 50MP primary lens and a 5MP selfie camera. Internally, the company provided it with 6GM of RAM and 128GB of storage with the ability to jump to 1TB via a microSD. More importantly, the rugged phone only offered a 4,050mAh battery.</p><p>This was the same battery Samsung delivered in the XCover 6 Pro, but rumors today suggest a potential upgrade is in the cards for this area. If true, then we're looking at a (roughly) 300mAh jump, which should aid in the phone's overall battery life.</p><p>With the latest listing in our hands, we can return to a previous leak that claims Samsung is working on <em>two </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-next-gen-pro-rugged-devices-early-leak">Pro-level rugged devices</a>. The first is the supposed XCover 8 Pro as it was spotted with model number SM-G766B in October. The device was similar in internal name with the XCover 7, furthering suspicions about it being a successor.</p><p>Moreover, that leak also mentioned a Tab Active 5 Pro or "Tab Active 6 Pro." It was highlighted that Samsung rarely offers a "Pro" for the same generation, which is why some believe is could jump to "6 Pro." Little is known specification-wise about either of these devices (aside from the newfound battery specs).</p><p>Like the current rumors, the discovery from two months ago claims Samsung could launch the next-gen rugged devices in mid-2025.</p>

You&apos;ll have to buy a year of Mint&apos;s unlimited tier to receive the savings, but the carrier is sweetening the deal by carving 50% off that plan, as well.</p><p>In other words, not only are you getting a record-smashing discount on one of the year&apos;s best phones, but you&apos;ll be getting one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a> we&apos;ve ever used for only $15 per month ($180 upfront). Even Black Friday couldn&apos;t touch those savings. </p>

<p>Order the Google Pixel 9 Pro during Mint Mobile's holiday sale and you'll score an incredible 40% off the device when you pair your purchase with one year of any data plan. As if that wasn't enough, Mint is also dropping 50% off the Unlimited plan, which means you could be getting one of 2024's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> AND a full 12 months of T-Mobile-powered wireless for as little as $779 (or $33 per month using affirm). That's cheaper than the phone was <em>by itself</em> during Black Friday! </p>
<p>👀<strong>Alternative holiday deal: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>Get $500 off the Google Pixel 9, plus 50% off a year of Unlimited at Mint</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9-pro/6810410/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="40c4ebdc-ec19-4147-b3db-938bee54a5d1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro 128GB: $999" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9 Pro 128GB: $999">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>This offer is quite similar to a recent Mint Mobile deal that gives you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>$500 off the base model Pixel 9</strong></a> when you buy the phone alongside some wireless, but if you need more power in your devices, this Google Pixel 9 Pro deal is tough to beat. </p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro triumphs by packing premium specs and AI-powered technology into a compact, easy-to-hold frame. Both the Pro and its XL big sibling come with seven years of guaranteed OS and security updates, plus you get unrivalled camera tech, the lightning-fast Tensor G4 chipset, and some truly remarkable battery life straight out of the box.</p><p>At full price, the Google Pixel 9 Pro may be a tough sell, but this Mint Mobile is changing everything. Let me put it this way: during Black Friday/Cyber Monday, the price of the unlocked Pixel 9 Pro dropped to $799, which was a record low at the time. By comparison, you can head to Mint Mobile right now and get the phone for a full $20 less, AND your phone bill will be covered for a year by one of the world&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a>. If you&apos;re in the market for a new wireless plan, yeah, it&apos;s that good. </p>
