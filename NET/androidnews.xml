<ul><li>Google Pixel 8a recently appeared on the UScellular website ahead of the expected launch.</li><li>The device has been listed on the carrier's "Device Tutorials" listing.</li><li>The listing reveals the device's design, which is very similar to the previous leaked renders.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After seeing the upcoming Pixel 8a appear in a new Mint color, another leak gives away the device&apos;s manual and tutorials.</p><p>The Pixel 8a was spotted by Evan Blass on the UScellular&apos;s Device Tutorials&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uscellular.com/support/device-tutorials?page=device/google/pixel-8a">support page</a>, showcasing the front pane of the mid-range device alongside several how-to&apos;s related to the next Google handset, which is expected to be unveiled at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a>. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So it's about 1AM early Saturday morning at Google HQ. How long will it take the right person to notice this and reach out to someone at the carrier, who will then presumably need to ping yet a third individual at the vendor responsible for posting (and removing) these tutorials? pic.twitter.com/4neK48wGUZ<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1779060659247849549">April 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The listing also showcases the device&apos;s front panel, which looks much more familiar than the renders we have seen earlier — a punch-hole display and more rounded corners than its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>.</p><p>The listing showcases tutorials like downloading and installing apps, pairing a device through Bluetooth, resetting and restarting the phone, etc.</p><p>For example, the "Enable Fingerprint Security" tutorial confirms that the device will be sporting Face Unlock next to the traditional biometrics. Aside from such nifty features, the listing hasn&apos;t revealed concrete specs about the device yet.</p>
<p>With the listing spotted on a US-based carrier site, the launch seems imminent at Google I/O 2024, which is a couple of weeks away. The recent Mint variant is spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-google-pixel-8a-renders-reveal-color-options">recent renders</a> next to the conventional obsidian, porcelain, and bay colorways.</p><p>The Pixel 8a will be the toned-down version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series from last year, which is expected to be powered by the same Tensor G3 SoC underneath. At least one of the prominent cameras from the flagship Pixel will also likely be carried to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>Earlier rumors have also hinted at a 6.1-inch screen featuring a 90Hz to 120Hz refresh rate on the Pixel 8a. Other reports have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-a-bigger-battery">indicated</a> that we could see a bigger battery capacity despite the device being tailored to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a> segment.</p>

<ul><li>A new Instant Replay feature is now available in Horizon Worlds, letting players instantly save gameplay footage.</li><li>Instant Replay automatically saves "select gameplay moments" in supported worlds, sending them to the Meta Quest app gallery for review when they occur.</li><li>Meta is also testing a new "Frame Budget Boost" feature to boost performance in Horizon Worlds.</li></ul>
<p>Every gamer has had a "did you see that?" moment. On consoles like the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch, players just have to long-press the share button and the last 30 seconds (or more) of gameplay will be saved, making it easy to share those moments with friends. Now, Meta is testing a similar feature in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/horizon-worlds-explained">Horizon Worlds</a> social app so gamers can spend more time playing and less time recording.</p><p>Meta calls the feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/quest/meta-horizon-worlds-v157-release-notes/">Instant Replay</a> and it automatically saves "select moments" from a world when set up by the world&apos;s creator. When these moments are captured, they&apos;re automatically sent to the gallery on your headset — also accessible via the Meta Quest smartphone app — where you can review and choose if you want to share them.</p><p>In Horizon Worlds, any world that supports the new feature will have a new camera icon on the world page. You&apos;ll also receive a notification of the supporting feature on your headset when you enter a world that supports Instant Replay. Meta allows players to disable the feature by heading to Settings, General, then Selecting “Off” for Instant Replay in the Horizon Worlds app.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Meta to find out if Instant Replay could appear in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>Over the years, Meta has significantly improved the gameplay capture experience on Meta Quest headsets. Capturing used to be low resolution and unreliable on the original Oculus Quest but that was improved on the Meta Quest 2. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> launched with an option to record gameplay in 16:9 1080p quality.</p><p>Late last year, Meta released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-quest-pc-casting-2-0-uncropped-widescreen/">Casting 2.0 for developers</a> which allowed ultrawide video capture at the expense of some capture performance. This mode is only available in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh/">Meta Quest Developer Hub</a>. Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2k4cCNG_7s">some tutorials exist</a> to make it relatively easy to get started.</p><p>An automatic capturing feature would be the best new addition yet, as it would mean players wouldn&apos;t need to manually start a recording before beginning their gameplay session.</p><p>In addition to Instant Replay, Meta is testing out a new "Frame Budget Boost" feature that will be enabled for all worlds automatically and can improve performance in some situations. Meta encourages world creators to review the new tool and see if it makes sense to keep enabled for their worlds.</p><p>All of this is part of Meta&apos;s push to make Horizon Worlds more accessible and available. The company began expanding Horizon Worlds beyond VR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/horizon-worlds-web-mobile-social-vr-free/">last Fall</a>, and better performance and automatic capture features could help propel the game&apos;s popularity among similar apps like Rec Room and Roblox.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the years, Wear OS watches have become more useful and powerful, but one thing has mostly stayed the same: battery life. Most Wear OS watches require a full charge every day or so, while light use might get you through two full days.</p><p>The introduction of dual architecture designs, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, will certainly change this conversation going forward, but for the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, we&apos;ve got some tips and tricks that&apos;ll help extend battery life when you need your watch to stay around for a few hours longer until you can make it to a charger.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-switch-to-battery-saver-mode"><span>Switch to battery saver mode</span></h2>
<p>All Wear OS watches have some kind of battery saver mode, whether it&apos;s the Google Pixel Watch series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a> series, or one of the many excellent companies making other Wear OS watches. Battery saver will automatically turn off things like the always on display, disable the tilt to wake functionality, and sometimes turn off other sensors to keep the watch in deep sleep for longer.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do it on a Google Pixel Watch or other watches that use the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>battery icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Confirm that you want to <strong>enable </strong>battery saver mode.</p><p>To turn it off, follow steps one and two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="szYVxdNG72yT3fmsZ782VV" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-battery-saver-mode.jpg" alt="Turning on battery saver mode on a Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szYVxdNG72yT3fmsZ782VV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="542" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here&apos;s how to enable battery saver mode on a Samsung Galaxy Watch:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Swipe <strong>over one page</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>battery icon </strong>with the recycle symbol inside.</p><p>4. Confirm that you want to <strong>enable </strong>battery saver mode.</p><p>To turn it off, follow the steps again.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t worry too much about this mode, as you should still be able to take advantage of many features of your watch, such as automatic workout tracking, although that also depends on your preferences. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fossil-smartwatch">Fossil smartwatches</a>, for example, allow you to customize your battery save mode.</p>

<p>While it can be convenient to use your watch hands-free by just saying the words "hey Google," this feature can be a real battery drain. Since the watch is listening for the keywords at all hours of the day, the low-power processor is always sipping from the battery.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to turn it off on all Wear OS watches:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>Google</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Assistant</strong>.</p><p>5. Disable <strong>"Hey Google"</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-always-on-display"><span>Disable always-on display</span></h2>
<p>Having an always-on display can look super cool on a smartwatch, but it also can cause screen burn-in and drains your smartwatch battery quicker. Battery saver mode will turn this off automatically, but we recommend keeping it off all the time if you&apos;re looking for the best battery life and screen health.</p><p>The process is the same on all Wear OS watches:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Display</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down to and <strong>disable always-on-display</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reduce-screen-brightness"><span>Reduce screen brightness</span></h2>
<p>Modern Wear OS watches have automatic brightness sensors, but you can still let your watch know that you&apos;re comfortable with a lower average brightness level. That means your watch will still get brighter when it needs to — like in direct sunlight — but it&apos;ll try to prioritize lower brightness levels when you&apos;re indoors or in dark areas.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to adjust the brightness level on a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>brightness icon</strong>. It looks like a Sun.</p><p>3. Reduce the brightness by tapping the <strong>minus icon</strong>.</p><p>4. For further battery savings, turn off <strong>Adaptive Brightness</strong> and leave the brightness at minimum.</p>

<p>The benefit here is obvious, although smartwatches are coming with brighter and brighter screens each year for better outdoor visibility, which is important for fitness enthusiasts who tend to use their wearables outdoors while exercising. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-raise-to-wake"><span>Disable raise to wake</span></h2>
<p>Raise to wake is a great alternative to having an always-on display, as it makes it effortless to raise your arm and see your watch display. But, like the always-on display, this one can drain the battery as it&apos;s always monitoring your wrist movements to ensure it turns the display on at the right time. Disabling this gesture will improve battery life.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do it on a Google Pixel Watch or other watches that use the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>gestures</strong>.</p><p>4. Disable <strong>raise-to-wake or tilt-to-wake</strong>. The wording depends on the watch you&apos;re wearing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="NvWTfNPHgxcAL6wTLmRkeK" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-tilt-to-wake.jpg" alt="How to disable tilt-to-wake on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvWTfNPHgxcAL6wTLmRkeK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="542" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Without raise to wake, you&apos;ll still be able to turn on the display by tapping it or pressing any button on your smartwatch.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-lower-screen-timeout-duration"><span>Lower screen timeout duration</span></h2>
<p>Most of the time when you look at your watch, you only need to glance at information for a second or two. By default, most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> will keep the screen on for 15 seconds at a time but this value can be lowered for extra battery savings. Here&apos;s how to adjust that.</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>display</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down to and select <strong>screen timeout</strong>.</p><p>5. Pick a <strong>lower screen timeout value</strong>, such as 10 seconds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:813px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="cqc7SQ3DRvrZoco98iBVVU" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-screen-timeout.jpg" alt="How to adjust screen timeout on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqc7SQ3DRvrZoco98iBVVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="813" height="271" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is not all that different from a smartphone, although given the limited engagement with a smartwatch, reducing the timeout may not prove to be as bothersome.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-off-sunlight-boost"><span>Turn off sunlight boost</span></h2>
<p>As you might expect, Wear OS watches with the Sunlight Boost feature allow the display to temporarily get brighter when in direct sunlight. This feature uses the auto brightness sensor to activate but will drain the battery faster, especially if you spend a lot of time outdoors.</p><p>Not all watches have this feature, but here&apos;s how to disable it on watches that do.</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>display</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Sunlight Boost</strong>.</p><p>5. <strong>Disable</strong> the feature.</p>

<p>Again, the benefit of a feature like this is invaluable to users that find themselves utilizing their wearables outdoors much of the time, especially while out on hikes and the like. In such circumstances, it may be helpful to turn on this feature, unless you absolutely need to conserve battery.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reduce-or-disable-vibration"><span>Reduce or disable vibration</span></h2>
<p>Having your watch vibrate when a notification or call comes through can be extremely handy, but that little vibration motor can sap a lot of battery if it&apos;s being used all day long. If this is a must-have feature, you might want to consider reducing vibration intensity which will help prolong the battery life of your watch.</p><p>Otherwise, if your watch makes noise with a notification or a call and you don&apos;t feel like you need the vibration feature, you can turn it off entirely.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do that on a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>vibration</strong>.</p><p>4. If you want to disable vibration entirely, <strong>disable vibration & haptics</strong>.</p><p>5. Otherwise, scroll down to the individual sections and <strong>reduce vibration </strong>for calls, notifications, and other categories.</p>

<p>On a Samsung Galaxy Watch, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down and tap <strong>Sounds and vibration</strong>.</p><p>4. If you want to disable vibration entirely, tap <strong>Mute</strong>.</p><p>5.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-only-enable-notifications-for-a-few-apps"><span>Only enable notifications for a few apps</span></h2>
<p>This step is best done on the watch app on your smartphone. By default, most Wear OS watches will display notifications for any app you have installed on your smartphone. If you&apos;re getting too many useless notifications, your watch&apos;s battery life will be reduced for no good reason.</p><p>Instead, be a little more choosy about which apps give you notifications on your watch and you&apos;ll likely be pleasantly surprised at how much better battery life can be. This step is very dependent on the app that your watch uses since each company has to use its own app for Wear OS 3 and beyond.</p><p>Here are the steps for the Google Pixel Watch:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>the Watch app</strong> on your smartphone. It&apos;s called Watch.</p><p>2. Select <strong>notifications</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll through the list and <strong>deselect apps </strong>for which you don&apos;t want to receive notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.80%;"><img id="m2NXNbY9ioqRUZgjsJ5QAK" name="google-pixel-watch-screenshot-phone-app-notifications.jpg" alt="Changing notifications in the Wear OS app for the Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2NXNbY9ioqRUZgjsJ5QAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, you can automatically deny notifications for new apps by disabling the "<strong>allow new app notifications</strong>" feature. That way you&apos;ll have to manually enable notifications for any new apps.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Watch users should follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Galaxy Wearable </strong>app on your smartphone.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Watch Settings</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>App notifications</strong>.</p><p>5. Scroll through the list and <strong>deselect apps </strong>you don&apos;t want to receive notifications for.</p><p>6. Go back to the <strong>previous screen</strong>.</p><p>7. Select <strong>Advanced notification settings</strong>.</p><p>8. Disable any <strong>applicable options </strong>such as Turn on screen and Auto turn on watch notifications for new phone apps.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-unused-radios"><span>Disable unused radios</span></h2>
<p>A smartwatch is as much a communication device as it is a watch, but not every radio needs to be enabled all the time. If you&apos;ve got a watch capable of LTE or 5G connectivity, turning off that radio when it&apos;s not needed will <em>substantially</em> improve battery life. Disabling Wi-Fi can further help battery life if you&apos;ve always got your phone tagging alongside your watch, as well.</p><p>In addition to that, you can turn off the NFC radio if you have no plans to use Google Pay or another type of tap-to-pay app on your watch.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to do it on a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Connectivity </strong>or <strong>Connections.</strong></p><p>4. Tap <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.</p><p>5. <strong>Turn off </strong>Wi-Fi.</p><p>6. Swipe from the left to <strong>go back</strong> to connectivity.</p><p>7. Tap <strong>NFC</strong>.</p><p>8. <strong>Disable </strong>NFC.</p>
<p>If you have an <strong>LTE or 5G watch</strong>, then the following steps are for you:</p><p>9. Swipe from the left to <strong>go back</strong> to connectivity.</p><p>10.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-a-battery-efficient-watch-face"><span>Use a battery-efficient watch face</span></h2>
<p>You can find an unlimited number of watch faces to customize your smartwatch to your liking but, until developers get on board with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">new Watch Face Format</a> from Google, many of them could be draining your battery needlessly.</p><p>Using the built-in watch faces that ship with your watch will give you the best result, but some of those can be boring. If you&apos;re looking at a third party watch face store like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeremysteckling.facerrel">Facer</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pujie.wristwear.pujieblack">Pujie</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=slide.watchFrenzy">Watch Maker</a>, look for faces with the following qualities:</p>
<p>- <strong>Lots of black space</strong>. OLED display pixels are completely off when pure black is displayed. More black pixels = more battery savings.</p><p>- <strong>Fewer animations</strong>. Watches with lots of animations needlessly use CPU power and drain battery.</p><p>- <strong>No built-in apps</strong>. Some watch faces have features like a built-in calculator or calendar. These are handy but can drain your watch&apos;s battery as if you were running an app all the time.</p><p>- <strong>Lower weather refresh rate</strong>. Some watch faces offer weather services that can drain your battery by checking for updates too often. Choose watch faces that use Wear OS&apos;s built-in weather service, instead.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-bedtime-mode-or-turn-off-at-night"><span>Use bedtime mode or turn off at night</span></h2>
<p>If you like to wear your watch to bed to track your sleep, it&apos;s important that you activate bedtime mode before you lay your head on the pillow. Otherwise, your watch&apos;s display might turn on every time you toss and turn, wasting precious battery while it&apos;s trying to track your sleep.</p><p>On a Google Pixel Watch or another watch that uses the stock Wear OS UI, here&apos;s how to do it:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>bedtime icon</strong>. It looks like a crescent moon with stars.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>checkmark </strong>to turn on bedtime mode.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-off-location-tracking"><span>Turn off location tracking</span></h2>
<p>A watch that&apos;s constantly checking for your location could create an obvious drain on your battery, but turning off location tracking should only be a last resort battery-saving measure. If you turn location off on your watch, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/find/">Find My Device</a> feature won&apos;t work. That means it won&apos;t be easy to locate your watch if you ever lose it.</p><p>Additionally, turning location services off will result in some features not working properly. You won&apos;t be able to get weather results based on current location, and Google Maps and other similar location-based services likely won&apos;t work at all.</p><p>If you&apos;re not worried about that, here&apos;s how to disable location tracking:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>location</strong>.</p><p>4. <strong>Disable</strong> location.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-check-for-rogue-apps"><span>Check for rogue apps</span></h2>
<p>Last but not least, if you&apos;re still experiencing poor battery life after trying any of the above steps, your real problem could lie in a rogue app. Every so often, an app will get stuck running in the background, causing heavy battery drain. This can happen on any computer or mobile device, but there are ways to detect it on some smartwatches.</p><p>Unfortunately, Pixel Watch owners don&apos;t have a good way to do this. The Samsung Galaxy Watch does, though, and here&apos;s how you can find it:</p>
<p>1. On your watch face, <strong>swipe down </strong>from the top of the display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down to and tap <strong>Battery and device care</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Battery</strong>.</p><p>5.

<p>Wear OS isn&apos;t the most battery-efficient smartwatch OS out there, but we hope that these tips will help you squeeze every bit of battery you can before you have access to your charger. If weak battery life is a constant problem for your watch, you may want to consider getting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-got-heavier-instead-of-fixing-battery-life-woes">smartwatch with a beefier battery</a>, although these tend to be much larger and aren&apos;t for everyone.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>WearOS and WatchOS have a couple dozen smartwatch games apiece, with a cult following of gamers who like puzzles and arcade games on tiny screens. However, one type of game would go with smartwatches like PB&J: a virtual pet watch face/ game, like the Tamagotchi or Pikachu wearables of the &apos;90s. </p><p>I owned the original Bandai Tamagotchi from 1996 and the Pokemon Pikachu in &apos;98. I have vague, nostalgia-tinted memories of raising my Tamagotchi to adulthood and running with my marathoner dad wearing my Pikachu pedometer to make the little monster happy. They both felt larger and more real than the dozens of pixels that displayed them.</p><p>Also, they <em>definitely</em> didn&apos;t die from neglect or abandon me for my lack of steps. You&apos;d have to dig them out of boxes in my parents&apos; garage to prove it. In my mind, they&apos;re still alive, just like Schrödinger&apos;s cat.</p><p>Anyway, as someone with a sedentary job, I rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">smartwatch move alerts</a> or stand reminders to stay healthy, but I&apos;m always looking for new ways to stay motivated. Most people push themselves to close their daily rings or keep up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">10,000-steps-a-day streak</a>, but it&apos;s very impersonal, and once you fall short, it can be hard to reestablish a routine. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing two Pokemon cheering for you on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Imagine a combination of Pokemon Sleep and Pikmin Bloom on your wrist </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Either a fitness watch&apos;s watch face or a smartwatch app would be the perfect place to revive &apos;90s virtual pets as a cute way to reward you for working out — or emotionally torment you for slacking off. </p><p>Imagine a little Pikachu (or copyright-safe critter) that responds to your activity. If you&apos;ve walked 500 steps in the last hour, he&apos;ll be strolling along happily. Complete a tracked activity, and you&apos;ll see a custom animation like lifting weights or swimming next to a Goldeen. But if you spend all day sitting, your virtual pet lays down and looks sulky. After enough days or weeks of neglect, it leaves, and you have to start over by catching a new critter.</p><p>If you wanted to capture that original Tamagotchi vibe, you could make it so you have to feed, entertain, and clean up after your pet, with it getting sick or dying from neglect in a worst-case scenario. Or you could make it sync with a goal-setting phone app like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finch.finch&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Finch</a> that rewards you for finishing all kinds of activities, not just fitness ones. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon-2.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing Mewtwo in a pod on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I lean towards simplicity and style, which would make such a feature ubiquitous enough to catch on. While an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> has the display space and RAM for an in-depth app, an active care system would lead to most people abandoning their virtual pets after the novelty wears off.</p><p>An automatic, <em>reactive</em> virtual pet tuned into your fitness data and customized to your fitness level or personal goals would be a really cute motivator. It could appear on your main watch face or as a tappable icon in a watch complication. The latter probably makes the most sense to preserve battery life, so you only see animations when actively checking on your virtual pet&apos;s condition. </p><p>Ideally, you could choose a different kind of pet based on how active you are in everyday life. A virtual cat would be more okay with long, lazy stretches, while serious athletes might raise (or level up to) a more active animal.</p><p>If I could see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> pet based on Fitbit Premium data throughout my day, that&apos;d be pretty darn cool! Samsung, which already has sleep animals to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-watch-4-update-watch-faces-setup-youtube-music-google-assistant">judge your sleep quality</a> and intends to launch a "My Vitality Score" this summer, could easily expand on its current system and use Samsung Health data to control your pet&apos;s health on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. For example, if you sleep badly, your virtual pet will have bags under its eyes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RKwCcUwPQqU8LdnarQWBAV" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-snowman.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 with a festive watch face showing a half-built snowman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RKwCcUwPQqU8LdnarQWBAV.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;d assume this kind of feature would require a proper smartwatch with enough processing power for animations. But I&apos;d like to see this feature on battery-saving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, too, since they&apos;re the most likely to have in-depth training data to pull from.</p><p>Last year, I spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-adds-four-free-christmas-watch-faces">Garmin holiday faces</a> (like the one above) that would start empty and then build a snowman or decorate a tree based on how many intensity minutes you completed. And other dynamic watch faces adjust to different pictures as the day progresses. </p><p>Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> have started adding more AMOLED displays, sleep coaching, and enough storage space for massive topographical maps or music playlists, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they could squeeze in more variable watch faces that adjust based on your weekly mileage, monthly steps, or other data, without needing a ton of RAM. The same applies to other fitness brands, too!</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe the virtual pets fad died out because the stakes were just as virtual. Once you forget to play with it and it dies, you realize how little impact it has on your life, and you move on. </p><p>In this scenario, there&apos;s something symbolically unsettling about neglecting your virtual pet — an avatar for your bodily health and fitness. It&apos;s easy to ignore an empty graph if you don&apos;t close a ring for a day, but harder when you see Pikachu tapping his foot impatiently. </p><p>Gamifying your fitness is nothing new, and we already have plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-favorite-running-and-walking-apps-for-motivation">motivational running and walking apps</a> to inspire us. But having a cute, animated creature on your wrist to celebrate your victories and nudge you into restarting your workout routine would be especially inspiring. </p><p>Here&apos;s hoping brands like Samsung or Apple decide to bring back this &apos;90s fad for the kids-at-heart like me who need help staying fit!</p>

Carsifi does this while adding a unique element in enabling drivers to share the connection with others in the vehicle. However, uncertainty over app and product support cast a shadow over an otherwise effective device.</p>
<p>To start, Carsifi first started out as a crowdfunded device before it became available to anyone in the U.S., Canada, and Australia in 2022. The initial $110 price has since dropped to around $90, making it more competitive against other Android Auto adapters like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/motorola-ma1-review">Motorola MA1</a>. The one catch is that the device seems to only be available through Carsifi&apos;s website.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wXiF8vm8jhCTGVbzw2DgXA" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-hand.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wXiF8vm8jhCTGVbzw2DgXA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wireless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories">Android Auto adapters</a> come in different types, mostly aiming to perform one task, which is to ensure a stable wireless connection between an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and a vehicle infotainment system. I&apos;ve tested several of them, and Carsifi is among the smallest adapters I&apos;ve seen thus far. Smaller in length and height than a credit card (though naturally thicker), its lightweight build and diminutive frame mean it won&apos;t feel cumbersome in the car.</p><p>Carsifi also includes two short cables, one with a USB-C port and the other with USB-A, thereby covering vehicles that might have one or the other. There&apos;s also a two-sided 3M adhesive strip in the box to mount it on the dash, or anywhere you prefer in the car within reach. It&apos;s also easy enough to use your own longer cable if you prefer something else for placement. In my case, I used the adhesive from the Motorola MA1, which I thought might hold the Carsifi better (it didn&apos;t), but ultimately tucked it away in a basin in front of the shifter.</p>

<p>Setting up the Carsifi was one of the easiest processes I&apos;ve experienced thus far. Plug the device into your vehicle&apos;s USB port, and it goes into pairing mode right away. Simply pairing it with an Android phone is enough to get it up and running, and the Android Auto interface appears onscreen within 30 seconds. </p><p>Other adapters or dongles sometimes require extra steps, be it setting up a Wi-Fi Direct connection or in some cases, using a dedicated app to establish everything. Carsifi is as plug-and-play as it gets, which is great for those looking for something less technical. The included instructions are barebones, so it is best to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.carsifi.com/support/home">full support page</a> to learn more about what it can do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vEt3FjxMprzsBWPPH6B2k9" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-front.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter next to Android Auto screen front view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vEt3FjxMprzsBWPPH6B2k9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, there is so much that works well with Carsifi that the app situation just feels downright confusing. The brand hasn&apos;t updated its Android app to work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> — much less <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. I reached out to the media relations staff and didn&apos;t get a response about software support, so I went to tech support, who told me they weren&apos;t updating it because of "Play Store rules," whatever that means. Instead, they suggested downloading an APK file of the previous app, which is easy enough to download and install but not a practical solution.</p><p>Mind you, the app doesn&apos;t do much anyway, and you don&apos;t need it to set up the device because settings are stored on the Carsifi itself rather than your phone. The problem is it&apos;s the only method available to update the firmware. Again, this is not something you see with every adapter, including the Motorola MA1, so it would just be more convenient for everyone to download an app from the Play Store and take it from there.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sewCJdYuNTMNb9sTLm9GJ9" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-connected.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter connected loose on car seat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sewCJdYuNTMNb9sTLm9GJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s possible to pair the Carsifi with other phones as well, allowing a passenger to run their Android Auto connection instead. While this might not seem useful at first glance, I think it makes a lot of sense because it all works wirelessly.</p><p>Double-click the Carsifi button, and it switches over to the other phone, eventually displaying that user&apos;s Android Auto setup. In cases where a passenger wants to listen to their music, contact people, or navigate maps, it makes things much easier. For example, if you, as the driver, have a Spotify account, but the passenger is on Apple Music, Tidal, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, switching phones negates any cumbersome account changes on the road.</p><p>You have to be careful with double-clicking because a single click pauses Android Auto, a feature that I still can&apos;t find much use for. Also, you have to exercise some patience because it can take a good 10 seconds before the adapter switches to the other phone, leaving a brief period of silence during which the "Is it working?" questions start to arise. After a while, though, you recognize these nuances, and it becomes old hat.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>More good news is that Carsifi works just fine in both factory and aftermarket systems.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Also, bear in mind that the adapter remembers the last phone it connected to, so there is no "master" device here. That&apos;s why you might want to double-click the button in case Android Auto doesn&apos;t appear for you or you forgot which phone might have been the last one.</p><p>The good news is that Carsifi works just fine in both factory and aftermarket systems. My Pioneer aftermarket head unit has no issues at all, and even better, steering wheel controls work like a charm, which doesn&apos;t always happen with all adapters.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-close-up.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter close-up stuck to dash." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The clunky support behind the product gives me pause. On the plus side, tech support was highly responsive, so if you have issues, someone should get back to you, but I can&apos;t be absolutely sure it will be the same for everyone, given the strange refusal to update the app.</p><p>That said, there are plenty of Android Auto dongles and adapters out there, many of which create wireless connectivity under similar conditions. Certain nuances or functional points put some distance between them, like how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/aawireless-review">AAWireless</a> has a dedicated app and technical features that others don&apos;t. The Motorola MA1 comes from a recognizable brand, though it doesn&apos;t feel as seamless to me. Plus, it may have a successor model coming sometime this year.</p><p>Carlinkit and Ottocast are two others that continue to produce Android Auto adapters, though make sure to read any fine print about incompatibilities. They may not work with certain automotive brands or aftermarket head units. Carsifi wades through a lot of that in ways that make it appealing as a plug-and-play product.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Once you go wireless with Android Auto, it's hard to go back.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Ultimately, once you go wireless with Android Auto, it&apos;s hard to go back. Even more so if you have a wireless charger in the car. Carsifi accomplishes the key task of making the transition feel simple and painless, establishing a connection in little time, and ensuring it stays that way. Out of all the adapters I&apos;ve tested, this one felt more stable than the others.</p><p>As I noted, the weird lack of support at the app level is hard to understand, and it&apos;s still only available through direct sale from Carsifi, so not something you will readily find from other online retailers. For the price, though, you do get something that works as advertised, taking away the kind of frustration you don&apos;t want to deal with on the road.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A follow-up to the first OnePlus Pad is anticipated, likely launching later than its predecessor.</li><li>A reliable tipster suggests a late 2024 debut for the OnePlus Pad 2, but details remain scarce.</li><li>While specific specs are unknown, hints about the OPPO Pad 3 suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, possibly indicating similar features for the OnePlus Pad 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like OnePlus is working on the next-generation version of last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a>, and there&apos;s word on when we might see it hit the market.</p><p>The first OnePlus Pad is tipped to be getting a follow-up, and it&apos;s expected to launch a bit later than when the inaugural version was released to the market. However, details on its exact release date or any specs and features are still under wraps for now.</p><p>That said, Max Jambor, a notable tipster on X (previously Twitter), suggested that the OnePlus Pad 2 is set to debut in the latter part of 2024. Yet, there&apos;s a lack of additional information about the tablet from this leaker.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus Pad2 will be launched in the second half of 2024<a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1778688197041504646">April 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As a quick rewind, the original OnePlus Pad hit store shelves in China as the OPPO Pad 2 just a month after its global launch. Now, the big question is whether we&apos;ll see a similar move with the OnePlus Pad 2.</p><p>Fingers crossed that the OnePlus Pad 2 steps up its game in areas where the first one fell short, especially in processing power and overall productivity experience.</p><p>Though concrete specs are still under wraps, there&apos;s one potential hint floating around for the OPPO Pad 3. This matters because, remember, the OnePlus Pad is essentially the global version of the China-exclusive OPPO Pad 2.</p><p>So, if the OnePlus Pad 2 follows suit with the OPPO Pad 3, there&apos;s a chance it could rock a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, as per leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/O8UhjzV9n#comment" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-could-be-months-away-but-it-might-be-a-very-powerful-upgrade" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>).</p><p>Waiting until fall or winter for a follow-up to a device unveiled back in February 2023 and released just two months later might be a bit of a bummer. However, it&apos;s reassuring to know that OnePlus isn&apos;t giving up on the tablet market or slowing down its efforts to rival some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">beloved Android tablets</a> for the long haul.</p>

You can find them posted in stores or online from companies like T-Mobile or Comcast, and any wired or wireless provider with over 100,000 customers is required to post them.</p><p>This got me thinking about the state of high-speed internet in North America — specifically how some of the biggest issues are still the same as they were years ago. </p>
<p>There are two real problems: unavailability and overcrowding. I&apos;m sure industry experts have fancy names for them, but in the end, many people have limited or no access to high-speed internet because of these issues.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-other-carriers-still-havent-covered-rural-areas-regardless-what-they-say">In rural areas</a>, there just isn&apos;t enough to go around. It costs a lot of money to bring service to an area, and service providers are reluctant to make it happen without enough customers to pay for it (and then provide huge profits). You have to remember that businesses are in it to get rich, not provide a service.</p>
<p>The flip side is in places where there are too many people. Fast, reliable service has a user cap, and when it&apos;s exceeded, the quality starts to go downhill. Usually, it&apos;s just an inconvenience at certain times of the day or on certain days, but internet providers are like airlines and will sell, sell, sell, regardless of actual capacity.</p><p>Nutrition labels aren&apos;t going to fix this. Maybe nothing can fix this. We can&apos;t let that stop us from demanding more from the companies that send us a hefty bill every month, though.</p>

<p>In rural parts of North America, there are two types of internet service — poor and none. In 2024, it&apos;s almost impossible to take advantage of the technology age or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">latest new phone</a> when internet is in the state it&apos;s in.</p><p>It is getting better, but just barely. Take where I live, for example. I&apos;m in one of those weird areas where rural isn&apos;t really rural — I live in the mountains 43 miles from Washington, DC. It&apos;s a cool place to live but it used to be the place where the internet went to die.</p>
<p>Up until a few years ago, "high-speed" just wasn&apos;t a thing. In 2012, the Obama administration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/13/we-can-t-wait-president-obama-signs-executive-order-make-broadband-const">started an initiative</a> to make high-speed internet access along all federal highways feasible. That has trickled away from the highway, and now I have 5G wireless and fiber internet at the same address that I had to pay for Comcast to bring cable to in 2007. </p><p>Not everyone, especially those away from any major city, is so lucky. There are areas with no internet service of any kind, but those are few and far between. The issue becomes clear when you look for high-speed coverage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:742px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.34%;"><img id="A29W5onipSs32WG9EsUNjU" name="verizon-5g-2024.png" alt="Verizon 5G service in 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A29W5onipSs32WG9EsUNjU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="742" height="559" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhistleOut)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">Starlink make things better</a>, but Starlink is expensive and requires a lot of maintenance. It&apos;s not like DirecTV, where it just works. </p><p>I understand the problem — there just aren&apos;t enough people to justify it. But this is not what we were led to believe high-speed wireless would be like in 2024.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4h78XuaD9ax7nMUyySH3L4" name="dupont-circle.jpg" alt="Dupont Circle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4h78XuaD9ax7nMUyySH3L4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone has heard stories about how bad connectivity is at a place like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O</a> or a New York Giants football game. When you cram that many people into one place at one time, it&apos;s very difficult to provide service to them all.</p><p>The thing is, it doesn&apos;t take a major tech conference or football game to make service bad. All it takes is just one user beyond what the total capacity can handle.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll use another anecdotal example here. I have some friends who live in DC, and at lunchtime through the week and all day Saturday and Sunday, their service slows to a crawl. This happens because everyone checks their phone at lunch and on the weekend a million extra people are in DC to see the sights. </p><p>AT&T provided the infrastructure based on the people who actually live there. Quadruple that number, and things get bad. This can made better using portable cell towers for things like ball games or during DC&apos;s Cherry Blossom Festival when the crowds are huge, so more infrastructure is the fix.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nutrition labels are fine for telling how the service we&apos;re paying for is supposed to work. The only way to fix anything is to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-proposes-new-5g-fund-rules">throw money at the problem</a>, though. </p><p>You probably don&apos;t see these issues — I admit they are fringe cases. However, they are the same fringe cases that have affected the same users for a decade. Before we move on to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/6g">6G</a>, they must be addressed, or North America will fall further behind when it comes to high-speed connectivity.</p>

<ul><li>Google has overhauled the Fitbit app since it officially acquired the company in 2021, making it fit in line with Material You design language.</li><li>In an interview published to the Google Design website, the Fitbit UX team explained how it decided to adapt the Fitbit app to integrate it with Google platforms. </li><li>The designers share the thought process behind the transition, which has spanned two years and is still ongoing. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google officially closed its deal to acquire Fitbit roughly three years ago, and it is still working to integrate Fitbit into its health portfolio and larger devices and services ecosystem. We can see the effects of this project in a few ways, like the Fitbit app redesign matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You design language</a>. However, we just got a rare look at the thought process behind Google&apos;s visual redo of the Fitbit app through an interview with the Fitbit UX team posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://design.google/library/the-goal-behind-the-goal" target="_blank">Google Design website</a>.</p><p>While it&apos;s obvious that the new Fitbit app — which has been rolled out in parts starting last year — fits the Material You theme, designers had to start working on the project before it was finalized. They started work two years ago and leaned into the Light and Space art movement that originated in Google&apos;s home state of California in the late 1960s. </p><p>"We knew there was momentum around the concept of &apos;form follows feeling,&apos; we knew it was about personalization, and we knew it was all about you — that worked really well for celebrating the best of Google with Fitbit," said Mat Helme, a Fitbit product and brand design lead. </p><p>This approach towards design is how we got the Fitbit app as it appears today, with light backgrounds, rich colors, and multiple pastel shades. We can see the effects of Google and Fitbit&apos;s design preferences still directing app updates, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-app-sleep-view-redesign">just-released Fitbit Sleep revamp</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ" name="Fitbit-Sleep-Redesign-2.jpg" alt="A Fitbit app image edited with a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Having Fitbit lean into rounded forms and softer colors feels fairly unique, and the circular form factor is a big part of how we design for that uplifting and compassionate feeling," said Judy Zhao, who is a leader of the Fitbit visual motion and systems team. "We&apos;re able to do this because we&apos;re combining multiple worlds into one holistic health journey experience."</p><p>However, it&apos;s about more than just design. The designers at Fitbit also wanted to make health and fitness metrics available in a way that was easy to digest. </p><p>"We&apos;re on a journey as a product team to become less about data collection and more about giving you insight and actionable information to take charge of your health journey," said Fitbit UX Design Lead Sarah Wilson. In practice, Wilson says that this entails using charts and text to explain all the fitness and health jargon that might not be naturally understood by everyone. Going a step further, Fitbit wants to make it easier for users to take recorded data and apply it to make the right fitness and lifestyle changes.</p><p>That leads us back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a>, which has the circular form factor to match Fitbit&apos;s rounded design preferences. It also includes the sensors required to provide the data Google wants to share in a simple way. So, it stands to reason that the Pixel Watch — and its circular form factor — is a big part of the Fitbit strategy moving forward. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung declared a new "Samsung Smart Wearable" in the Bluetooth SIG database on Friday, April 12.</li><li>The model number, SM-L305U, matches the leaked model number of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7.</li><li>According to the listing, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 will feature Bluetooth 5.3 support, just like the current Galaxy Watch 6. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re likely only a few months away from Samsung debuting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 series</a>, which may coincide with a new Wear OS upgrade. Leaks are starting to intensify ahead of that impending launch, but a new listing in the Bluetooth SIG database looks to be a rare confirmation of the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s model number and specs.</p><p>The official declaration matches the model number reported in prior Galaxy Watch 7 leaks, providing more evidence that listing is indeed referring to the upcoming smartwatch. </p><p>The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) certifies products that are licensed to use the Bluetooth specification, and devices that complete the Bluetooth Qualification Process appear in the Bluetooth SIG&apos;s database. This occasionally gives us a look at products before they are released, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-might-launch-pro-variant-of-its-google-tv-competitor">Walmart&apos;s upcoming Google TV device</a> from a few days prior. A listing in the Bluetooth SIG database dated Friday, April 12, concerns a "Samsung Smart Wearable (Smart Watch)," but doesn&apos;t clarify further (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-bluetooth-june-2024-launch/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). </p><p>However, the listing does state that the model number for this smartwatch is SM-L305U, and that is familiar. Late last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-could-double-the-amount-of-onboard-storage-with-the-galaxy-watch-7">a prior Galaxy Watch 7 leak</a> revealed the suspected model numbers for up to three potential smartwatches in the upcoming lineup.  SM-L300 and SM-L305 were tied to one model, SM-L310 and SM-L315 represented another, and the premium model uses SM-L700 and SM-L705. The new entry in the Bluetooth SIG database confirms this report to be accurate. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q4VWhTuQwUTcSNBztxvfs7" name="Galaxy-Watch-7-Bluetooth-SIG.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 7 listing in the Bluetooth SIG database." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4VWhTuQwUTcSNBztxvfs7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the model number, all the Bluetooth SIG listing tells us is that the Galaxy Watch 7 will feature Bluetooth 5.3 support. This was also the case for last year&apos;s lineup, so there is no change in terms of Bluetooth connectivity coming this year. </p><p>Still, there are a lot of rumored features related to the Galaxy Watch 7 series that are still up in the air. There will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-chip-performance-rumors">reportedly be three models this year</a> instead of two, and rumors suggest Samsung is exploring a rectangular design. It&apos;s unclear whether a fresh design might make its way to the Galaxy Watch 7, though. What&apos;s more likely is that the new lineup will feature increased on-device storage space, getting a boost to 32GB. </p><p>Samsung usually holds a Galaxy Unpacked event in the summer of each year, so that&apos;s when we expect to see the Galaxy Watch 7 officially revealed. </p>

<ul><li>TCL is releasing an AI-generated movie called Next Stop Paris, and a trailer just dropped for it on YouTube. </li><li>The short film features an original script and human voice actors, but uses generative artificial intelligence for animation. </li><li>Next Stop Paris will appear on TCLtv+, the free streaming service offered by TCL, and is the company's first foray into original content. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TCL, the company we know for budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TVs</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android smartphones</a>, is now diving into original content creation. Its new content will appear on its free streaming service, TCLtv+, and there will be one short movie to start. However, these aren&apos;t just any movies: the newly-created TCLtv+ Studios will be making animated films using generative artificial intelligence. </p><p>Generative AI has been used in a number of mainstream applications, including text generation, image generation, and even custom animations. However, the technology is still maturing, and AI hasn&apos;t been used by a major company for full-length video animation just yet. That changes with Next Stop Paris, which TCL calls an "AI-generated special." It&apos;s a short romance film written by human writers and voice actors, with contributions from human artists as well. However, the bulk of the animation is handled by artificial intelligence.</p><p>TCL hasn&apos;t made any major breakthroughs in generative AI animation if the Next Stop Paris trailer is any indication. It looks as if the company used an AI image generator to create stills and then added some motion to them. It&apos;s very apparent that the trailer was made with artificial intelligence, as you can see abnormalities, especially in the characters&apos; faces. The voice track doesn&apos;t seem to line up perfectly with moving lips either, creating a viewing experience that can only be described as awkward. </p><p>You can see for yourself what TCL&apos;s animated romance movie will look like from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhQnnISdDIU" target="_blank">YouTube trailer</a>: </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhQnnISdDIU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Again, it isn&apos;t as bad as past examples of AI animation have been — you might recall the viral videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti — but it certainly isn&apos;t good either. People at the helm of TCL want to push boundaries with this AI-generated film and see whether viewers enjoy it. While it isn&apos;t explicitly stated, there are obvious cost benefits to TCL making original content that leverages AI rather than using human animators or a live-action format. </p><p>"Story will be at the heart of everything we do," says Chris Regina, chief content officer of TCL. "We are empowering creators and storytellers to use this new technology so the human experience is enriched, and we believe that Creatives with limitless imagination will drive endless innovation. We view &apos;Next Stop Paris&apos; as an early experiment and we&apos;re excited to see how it&apos;s received in the town square."</p><p>TCL says that Next Stop Paris will be released this summer, both online and through the TCLtv+ app.</p>
