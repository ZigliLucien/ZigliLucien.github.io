<ul><li>Xiaomi Pad 7 and its Pro model are the next mid-range tablets that will likely launch soon.</li><li>A new leak reveals its processors and screen sizes ahead of the anticipated launch.</li><li>The upcoming tablets will likely carry displays similar to those of the previous models yet could feature faster charging speeds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi has got some impressive Android tablets lined up for various regions, including the Xiaomi Pad 6 series, which is due for a refresh. A recent leak from China spills some details on the upcoming Xiaomi Pad 7 and Pad 7 Pro.</p><p>The leak comes from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3108827753/OB2cHt3cv">Weibo post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_pad_7_and_pad_7_pro_specs_leak-news-64900.php">GSMArena</a>), which indicates that the Xiaomi Pad 7 and the Pad 7 Pro may share the same 11.6-inch LCD screen with a 144Hz refresh rate display.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&apos;s current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">flagship tablet</a>—the Pad 6S Pro—also has the same refresh rate, although it has a larger screen measuring 12.4 inches. The leaked specs further reveal that the Pad 7 might be powered by Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, and the Pro model could have Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</p><p>The upcoming tablets also differ significantly in battery charging speeds. The non-Pro model will have charging speeds of up to 45W, while the Pro model supports Xiaomi&apos;s 67W super fast charging.</p>

<p>The latest leak suggests that the upcoming Xiaomi Pad 7 and Pad 7 Pro are looking promising. While the previous models had 11-inch screens with 144Hz refresh rates, the new versions are set to get upgraded SoCs and faster charging speeds. Battery capacities, however, are still under wraps.</p><p>While the launch timeframe of these upcoming tablets is still unclear, they are believed to see daylight alongside the Xiaomi 15 series, which has a rumored launch date later this month.</p><p>Currently, Xiaomi is selling the Pad 6S Pro as its flagship Android offering in China and other regions. The company also sells the Xiaomi Pad 6 and Pad 6 Pro, which saw a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomis-pad-6-goes-global">global launch</a> last year and an initial launch in early April 2023.</p>

<p>Roku introduced a refreshed Roku Ultra device in September 2024 with a new quad-core processor that Roku claims delivers 30% faster performance. The box also gets Wi-Fi 6 and comes bundled with the Roku Voice Remote Pro (2nd Gen). This is the best streaming device that Roku offers, but it&apos;s also the most expensive at $99.99, although it&apos;s often on sale for $79.99. </p><p>The Roku Ultra (2024) supports all the major HDR formats like Dolby Vision and HDR10+. It has an HDMI 2.1 port which allows it to offers smoother transitions between different refresh rates or content sources on compatible TVs. If you have a Wi-Fi 6 router at home, you&apos;ll be able to take advantage of the faster speeds with the new Ultra streaming box. Roku says the Ultra offers the best Roku experience, whether your watching live TV, free streaming apps, or the one&apos;s you&apos;ve subscribed to. The new powerful box allows you to pair Bluetooth headphones directly with it, so you don&apos;t have bother with a wired headset plugged into the remote.</p><p>Speaking of the remote, the new Voice Remote Pro supports voice commands and quick access to volume buttons, but it is also backlit, making it easier to use in the dark. If you&apos;ve misplaced the remote somewhere in the house, simply press the remote finder button on the box or use a simple voice command to help you find it.</p>

<p>The Roku Streaming Stick 4K is just about the perfect streaming device for most people with a 4K TV. As it&apos;s a streaming stick, it hides behind the TV and is powered by USB so if you wall-mount your display, you don&apos;t have any extra wires hanging down from behind. On the technical side, this device is one of Roku&apos;s most capable streaming devices with support for 4K HDR with Dolby Vision, HDR 10/10+, and even HLG which mostly means that if it&apos;s in HDR and you can stream it, this stick can play it. Wi-Fi 5 with MIMO is supported so you also get plenty of speed to stream without buffering.</p><p>This cheaper model works with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri for voice control. There is no USB port on this device and as a result, no local storage playback will be possible. The Micro-USB port on this streaming stick is only for power.</p><p>With a low price and great support for 4K and HDR, this streaming stick is the best bet for most people looking for a high-quality image without spending money on extra features they won&apos;t use like the Pro remote or local playback.</p>

<p>The Roku Express 4K+ streaming device keeps both, the improved design and great starter price of the previous Roku Express. The Express 4K+ comes with an adhesive tape so you can stick it to the bottom of the TV, which is great if your TV is wall-mounted and you don&apos;t want dangling cables.</p><p>While the standard Roku Express tops out at HD resolution, the Roku Express 4K+ streams HD, 4K, and HDR content for just $10 more. It also features a more powerful processor, dual-band Wi-Fi support, and an upgraded voice remote. Unlike the previous remote, the upgraded Roku voice remote allows you to navigate the streaming service and control your TV&apos;s power and volume from the same device.</p><p>Roku is marketing the Express 4K+ as "the most affordable way to stream in 4K," and it&apos;s not wrong. The device is also easy to set up, making it a great option for first-time streamers. However, experienced streamers who want to add a high-quality and affordable streaming device to every room with a TV should also consider grabbing a Express 4K+ or two.</p>

<p>Roku seems to have discontinued the Streambar Pro, which was it&apos;s most powerful and premium soundbar. The Roku Streambar is not its direct replacement, but it&apos;s the best soundbar that Roku offers at the moment. You can plug this into your existing TV and stream Roku&apos;s services without needing a Roku streamer, which is its main selling point. You&apos;ll also get much better audio quality than your TV speakers thanks to the four 1.9-inch full-range drivers in the soundbar.</p><p>The Streambar supports up to 4K streaming with HDR support. Sadly it can&apos;t do HDR10+ or Dolby Vision, but ironically, the cheaper Streambar SE does support HDR10+ playback. The latter is also far cheaper if you can get it on sale, but it lacks Ethernet, voice search funtion on the remote, and doesn&apos;t support Dolby Audio. </p><p>You can expand the audio fidelity of the Streambar by adding in two Roku Wireless Speakers and the Roku Wireless Bass subwoofer, for a proper home-theatre experience. The Streambar can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker or you can pair your headphones to it so you don&apos;t disturb your partner at night.</p>

<p>Roku has its own line of smart TVs now, ranging across three different series. If you&apos;re looking for the best though, there&apos;s only the Roku Pro Series that you should be considering. These 4K QLED TVs come in 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch screen sizes. There&apos;s full-array local dimming Mini LEDs for the backlighting, which means you should expect greater control over bright and dark areas in HDR content with little blooming. The panels also support Dolby Vision IQ, along with the other usual HDR formats. </p><p>Roku Pro Series also feature AI-powered picture corrections like Roku Smart Picture Max which intelligently cleans up the source signal and optimizes it for the TV&apos;s size. The TVs also feature slim bezels and a stylish frame, which should blend well with most entertainment setups. Roku also has a feature similar to Samsung Frame series called Backdrops. You can choose a static shot of a painting from famour artists and photogrphers or even upload your own personal photos and use the TV as a giant photo frame.</p><p>The Roku Pro Series 4K TVs ships with the Voice Remote Pro (2nd gen), giving you all the benefits like backlit buttons and USB-C charging. The TV&apos;s built-in speakers support Dolby Atmos, but you can take it a step further by pairing it with other Roku speakers and subwoofers for a vastly better audio experience.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Roku Wireless Speakers is that they promise to deliver outstanding sound for your Roku TV setup. They are bundled as a stereo pair and are incredibly easy to set up with your Roku TV or Streambar. They support Bluetooth streaming so that you can enjoy your favorite audio from any compatible Bluetooth device. Each speaker contains a 0.75-inch tweeter and a 3.5-inch woofer.</p><p>If you want to enhance your Roku TV&apos;s audio setup, the Wireless Speakers is a great place to start. Depending on how far you want to go, you can add a subfoofer and a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar into the mix, or add another pair of these stereo speakers for a full, surround sound experience. Keep in mind that these speakers won&apos;t work with any other TV or even Roku streaming players, as they only pair with Roku TVs and the Streambar series.</p>

It offers terrific specs, has great features, and is good competition to the newly introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>. However, if you are looking for an all-in-one Roku solution, the Roku Pro Series 4K TV is the best place to start. Alternatively, if you&apos;re getting into high-definition streaming or if you want to outfit multiple spaces, you can&apos;t go wrong with the updated Roku Express 4K+.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can the Oura Ring 4 automatically detect workouts?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>Best answer: </strong>Yes! The Oura Ring 4 smart ring is designed to automatically detect exercise, workouts, and other distinct movements, like gardening or walking the dog. That’s thanks to a feature called Automatic Activity Detection (AAD) that can track more than 40 different activities automatically. This ranges from runs and walks to even housework or swimming.</p></article></section>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-2.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AAD feature in Oura Ring enhances the experience by providing and tracking even more information. Along with logging duration and distance for certain activities, it can also provide an average heart rate and heart rate zone information once the Oura Ring 4 detects that you’re in the middle of a specific activity among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063022993-Automatic-Activity-Detection">40 supported activities</a>. (It can do this if you manually queue up a workout as well). </p><p>When the activity is done, you can look in the app and see a heart rate chart that shows how long you spent in each of the six heart rate zones. This will help you determine the intensity of the workout and if you need to ramp up the next time or slow down because you’re staying in a target heart rate zone for too long. It will also give you an idea of which activities get your heart rate up the most or help you keep consistent numbers. </p><p>There’s also a bar chart at the bottom of the Activity detail card that will add up your total activity minutes for the week and how these relate to metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. </p><p>Oura calculates the heart rate zones, which range from slow movements and recovery to all-out all-out effort whereby your heart and respiratory system are working at maximum capacity, by using a formula that takes into account your maximum heart rate combined with your age, how long the activity lasted, and additional metrics. </p><p>The feature, which is coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> members as well as Gen 3 members, means even if you forget to start tracking a workout, the ring will detect that you’re doing something, potentially even know what specifically you’re doing, and start tracking it so you get credit for your hard work. So, no more frustratingly stamping your feet because you&apos;re halfway through a 5K run and forgot to start the workout.</p><p>Oura says that AAD is about 89 percent accurate within one minute, and it is able to detect all types of activities based on the way you’re moving, your heart rate, and other factors. Some of the most popular activities it can track, according to Oura, include walking, yoga, hiking, yard work, and housework. Once you are doing the activity for at least 10 minutes, the ring should kick in and realize what’s going on. The more you perform any of these activities or others Oura Ring can detect, the better the smart ring will get at automatically detecting them. </p><p>Introduced in early October 2024, Oura Ring 4 is the latest generation of the company’s smart ring. At its heart is Smart Sensing technology that works with research-grade sensors to adapt to your finger and deliver continuous and accurate data. Lightweight with a smooth interior and thin shape, Oura says it’s also more comfortable than previous generation models. It’s also available in an expanded range of sizes, from 4 up to 15. </p><p>We have already named the Oura Ring Gen 3 smart ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">the best smart ring</a> you can buy. We’re confident the Oura Ring 4 will overtake this model as the new favorite for smart ring buyers.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next flagship trio is (likely) a few months away, and a new report claims it&apos;s already making grand success goals.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30535">The Elec</a> (Korean), Samsung is supposedly aiming to produce a substantial amount of Galaxy S25 devices to meet its estimated demand (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Samsung-expects-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-to-be-half-of-all-S25-series-sales_id163650">Phone Arena</a>). Per the company&apos;s supply orders, the goal is to produce roughly 22 million Galaxy S25 series devices by June 2025. The publication claims Samsung expects its Galaxy S25 Ultra model to make up ~11 million of its produced devices.</p><p>The report states Samsung will begin "mass production" of the Galaxy S25 series parts in October. Moreover, the actual assembling of the devices could start in December. Samsung is expected to have 2 million S25 devices ready by December with 5 million on the assembly line in January.</p><p>The publication states Samsung expects its base model to account for ~30% of the sales in North America and Europe. Samsung reportedly sees its S25 Plus as a hit (again), as its outlook puts it around 35% to 40% in sales for North America.</p><p>Samsung allegedly sees Galaxy S25 Ultra sales in North America strive for 30%, but they may stay closer to 20% in Europe.</p><p>All in all, the "volume" and sales number of the S25 series are estimated to be similar to the Galaxy S24 series. The publication notes that Samsung could seek 30 million S25 devices produced by the end of 2025.</p><p>What’s really interesting about Samsung’s estimates for the Galaxy S25 Plus is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">how well the S24 version did</a>. It gave Samsung an 8% revenue boost compared to the S23 Plus. The S24 Plus came with cool upgrades that users loved, like more RAM, a sharper QHD+ display, and powerful on-device AI.</p><p>There were also rumors that Samsung may drop the Plus model, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-discontinued-rumors">those were quickly refuted</a>, likely because it found success in 2024.</p><p>The next flagship trio is expected to debut sometime in January if Samsung&apos;s past behavior is any indication. Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">leaked renders</a> suggest the series is moving into a thin phone era with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">flat sides and rounded corners</a>.</p>

<p>The Brushed Silver option is a rather unique hue that seems to shift as the light hits it at different angles. It's also great for hiding scratches and scuffs if you have a more active lifestyle, meaning you can lift weights without worrying too much.</p></p>

<p>You&apos;ll find a lot more to choose from here than you will with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-samsung-galaxy-ring-should-you-buy">Galaxy Ring color options</a>. Every hue of the Oura Ring 4 looks great and it&apos;s important that you take into account your current jewelry and that types of things you like to wear. You should also consider your lifestyle; are you more active and often using your hands? If so, the glossy options like silver and gold may not be the best options, as they may likely be easier to scratch and scuff. The brushed metal colors like the Brushed Silver finish may be better options, as it would be much better at hiding those.</p><p>However, not every Oura Ring 4 is created the same, and how much you pay will depend on the color option you select. Here&apos;s the breakdown of the Oura Ring 4 colors/finishes and their cost:</p>
<ul><li>Silver, Black: $349</li><li>Brushed Silver, Stealth: $399</li><li>Golf, Rose Gold: $499</li></ul>
<p>Itching for the Gold or Rose Gold Oura Ring 4? You&apos;ll be paying the most for those options. Silver and black are rather common options, which is likely why they cost the least, with Brushed Silver and Stealth sitting between these (just $50 more, but $100 less than the pricer options).</p><p>That said, no matter which color you choose, you&apos;ll end up with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> on the market, featuring an impressive all-titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/is-the-oura-ring-4-waterproof">waterproof build</a>.

<h2 id="how-much-water-can-the-oura-ring-4-resist-2">How much water can the Oura Ring 4 resist?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> is a good-looking wearable that you&apos;ll want to take everywhere you go, but can you? For example, you may want to go scuba diving, but there are some details you need to know before you head out with your flashy new Oura Ring 4.</p><p>Is the Oura Ring 4 waterproof? The smart ring is waterproof up to 100 meters or 330 feet. Oura confirms you can take it with you while swimming, showering, or participating in water activities such as snorkeling. However, due to the higher water pressure, the company does not recommend using it while scuba diving in depths greater than 100 meters or submerging it for over 12 hours.</p><p>The ring&apos;s operating temperature is between -10 Celsius and 52 degrees Celsius, meaning you can take it with you to ice baths, hot tubs, showers, and even cryotherapy tanks. However, it&apos;s important to remember that you shouldn&apos;t expose the ring to these activities for too long. You should also avoid exposing the Oura Ring to any scenarios where it&apos;s exposed to extreme pressure since it can also affect the smart ring&apos;s water resistance.</p><p>Repeated drops and poor maintenance are factors that can degrade your ring&apos;s water resistance. Oura provides some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402031939475-Caring-for-Your-Oura-Ring" target="_blank">fantastic tips</a> on caring for your smart ring and expanding its lifespan. For example, Oura recommends cleaning the sensors approximately once a week with either mild dish soap and water or wiping the ring with a piece of cloth or your T-shirt.</p><p>Another helpful tip is to wear your Oura Ring on your non-dominant hand. Using your less dominant hand reduces contact with objects that collide with your Oura Ring 4. You can also avoid using rings adjacent to the Oura Ring 4 and prevent scratching as you move your fingers.</p><p>It&apos;s also essential to avoid exposing your Oura Ring 4 to harsh chemicals, such as cleaning products, sunscreen, lotions, and other chemicals that can weaken the watertight seals. If you expose it to water or any chemicals, dry it immediately to avoid permanent damage. So, when it&apos;s cleaning time at home, it&apos;s best to put the ring in a safe place. Therefore, even though Oura says you can expose your ring to specific temperatures, it would be best not to since it contributes to your smart ring&apos;s water resistance lasting longer.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 has the same rating as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>; it can be submerged for 100 meters.

While I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">initially excited about the hardware button</a>, it was unwieldy to use in the two weeks I tested the iPhone 16 Pro Max — it should have been integrated into the power button, similar to what ASUS did on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a> last year.</p><p>While there&apos;s plenty of new stuff on the phone, there&apos;s a glaring omission: Apple Intelligence. Apple&apos;s much-touted AI features won&apos;t be available until early 2025, and that puts the iPhone 16 Pro Max in an awkward position; the hardware itself is an iterative upgrade over last year, and you&apos;ll need to wait at least three months to unlock what is arguably its best feature.</p><p>So should you wait until next year to buy the iPhone 16 Pro Max? Let&apos;s take a look.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max made its official debut on September 9, and the phone went on sale globally on September 20. Similar to last year, the base model has 256GB of storage, and it is available in 512GB and 1TB variants as well — I&apos;m using the 512GB model.</p><p>In a positive move, Apple is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max at the same price as last year&apos;s models, and this is true not just in the U.S., but also key global markets like the U.K. and Germany. This is what the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs in various regions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB):</strong> $1,199 / £1,199 / €1,449 / ₹1,44,900</li><li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max (512GB):</strong> $1,399 / £1,399 / €1,699 / ₹1,64,900</li><li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max (1TB): </strong>$1,599 / £1,599 / €1,949 / ₹1,84,900</li></ul>
<p>Interestingly, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is more affordable than its predecessor in India, and that&apos;s a great move by Apple. The brand is seeing sizeable momentum in the country, and each variant of the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs roughly $178 less this year.</p>


<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-design"><span>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w63feHSnHDcojSGuUD5xQ" name="iphone-16-pro-max-1.jpg" alt="Back view of iPhone 16 Pro Max against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w63feHSnHDcojSGuUD5xQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple didn&apos;t change the design of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the phone looks identical to its predecessor. The only way to tell both phones apart is that the latest device is taller and wider than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, but other than that, they share the same design.</p><p>That means you get a titanium mid-frame with a glass front and back, and the glass protection is touted to be even better this year. While I tend to test the effectiveness of these claims with Android phones (inadvertently, most of the time), I wasn&apos;t willing to risk that with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and I put it in a case shortly after setting it up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="thiPfamgYcLDGJKVcbwKy4" name="iphone-16-pro-max-11.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max metal sides" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/thiPfamgYcLDGJKVcbwKy4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has the same flat sides with rounded edges, and the beveled sides make it easier to use than previous years. The build quality is predictably great, and while this isn&apos;t a brand-new design, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is immediately recognizable. The phone retains IP68 dust and water resistance, and like last year, it can be submerged in up to 6 meters of water — most Android phones are only rated at up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gxY5SbV74pEEWQUjYEu563" name="iphone-16-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max angled view highlighting logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gxY5SbV74pEEWQUjYEu563.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design itself hasn&apos;t changed, the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in an interesting Desert Titanium color option, and this is the variant I&apos;m using. Apple switched out the Blue Titanium model of the iPhone 15 Pro Max with the new color option, and it looks terrific. The subtle gold hue looks great on the frosted glass back, and the color-matched camera rings and mid-frame give the phone a distinct character.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U4rPVcQ7Vu75kqfLLuLJi3" name="iphone-16-pro-max-6.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max back view showcasing camera modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4rPVcQ7Vu75kqfLLuLJi3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don&apos;t like the color, you can pick up the device in White Titanium, Black Titanium, and Natural Titanium options instead. The camera housing has the same distinctive design as previous years, and is slightly raised; thankfully, there are no issues with usability.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max is 4.1mm taller and 0.9mm wider than its predecessor, and the increased dimensions make it a bit unwieldy to use one-handed. It is taller than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Nubia Z60 Ultra</a> dwarfs the iPhone 16 Pro Max in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5" name="iphone-16-pro-max-9.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max side view with power button and Camera Control" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A major highlight this year is the introduction of Camera Control, a button that sits to the right. It is an intriguing addition in that not many brands provide hardware controls for the camera, and it is versatile: you can use it to take photos with a short press, and a long press switches to video. The best feature is the ability to adjust zoom level by sliding your finger across the capacitive button, and a double tap allows you to unlock additional controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pMexFshkZtjCt7RQHyvto4" name="iphone-16-pro-max-10.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Control button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pMexFshkZtjCt7RQHyvto4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the idea is undoubtedly novel, the button is in a non-optimal location. It&apos;s awkward to access, and while adjusting the zoom level isn&apos;t that much of a hassle, it was always a bother to switch to other controls. Then there&apos;s the fact that video recording is only enabled as long as you press down on the button. After a week of use, I realized it was easier to just use the settings on the viewfinder to change controls than rely on the button. I also inadvertently pressed the button whenever picking up the phone off a table, and that was irksome.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fQgnkaDhArev4zxRqaK946" name="iphone-16-pro-max-8.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max side view with volume buttons and Action Button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQgnkaDhArev4zxRqaK946.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The left side of the frame contains the usual options: volume up and down, and the Action Button that debuted last year. The SIM card tray sits to the left as well, and you get the ability to slot in a physical SIM alongside an eSIM — if you&apos;re outside the U.S. USB-C charging is intact, and it makes using the iPhone 16 Pro Max that much easier. I wrote about how the switch to USB-C last year allowed me to use the iPhone 15 Pro Max a lot longer than I usually would, and that&apos;s true this year as well.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-display"><span>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R7Bo4K4RuQT8tFDCS4n8a4" name="iphone-16-pro-max-13.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7Bo4K4RuQT8tFDCS4n8a4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After four years of using 6.7-inch panels, Apple is increasing the screen size in the Pro Max series to 6.9 inches. The size difference is immediately evident when using the iPhone 16 Pro Max next to its predecessor, and what I like the most about is that the phone itself isn&apos;t noticeably bigger; Apple achieved this by trimming the bezels, and the overall effect is quite striking.</p>
<p>In real-world use, that means you get an additional line of text when browsing. The OLED panel itself is one of the best on any phone today; it has ProMotion tech — dynamic 120Hz refresh — along with HDR10 and Dolby Vision. The resolution is slightly higher at 2868 x 1320, but the pixel density is the same as last year, and the Ceramic Shield protection delivers 50% increased resilience against tumbles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YPc5MmDPQSfvnwrSR3y758" name="iphone-16-pro-max-19.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Dynamic Island highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPc5MmDPQSfvnwrSR3y758.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, this is one of the best screens available today, and that&apos;s evident when streaming HDR content or playing games. You get vibrant colors with excellent contrast, and while there isn&apos;t as much customizability when it comes to color tonality, True Tone automatically tweaks color balance based on ambient light, and it does a good job in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jAbTLUkofY6oM9xkicnETD" name="iphone-16-pro-max-20.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jAbTLUkofY6oM9xkicnETD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t see any issues with brightness levels either, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max is among the best in this area as well. That said, the Pixel 9 Pro XL got noticeably brighter in outdoor use, and Google somehow managed to outdo every other brand this year. </p><p>Dynamic Island is unchanged from last year, and while the pill-sized cutout is bigger than what you get with Android devices, it isn&apos;t as unsightly as the previous notch. The ability to use this area for actionable things like music control and navigation alerts is still great, and while Android brands have tried to emulate it, no one came close.</p>

<p>Apple is in a unique position in that it controls both the hardware and software stacks, and that gives it greater freedom when it comes to delivering the best possible performance. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Pro, and it brings considerable upgrades — it has 20% greater efficiency under similar workloads as the A17 Pro, increased memory bandwidth, a 16-core neural engine that&apos;s more efficient than last year, and 2x gains in ray tracing.</p><p>As you&apos;d imagine, there are no issues in daily use; the iPhone 16 Pro Max is one of the fastest phones around, and that is noticeable when playing demanding titles. I didn&apos;t see any slowdowns or lag whatsoever, and overheating wasn&apos;t a problem during marathon gaming sessions.</p>

<p>While there are gains around ray tracing, rasterization is in line with last year, with the phone delivering similar scores in 3DMark&apos;s Wild Life Extreme as its predecessor — this has allowed Qualcomm to take the lead in this area. That said, the phone has the best single- and multi-core results of any device, and that&apos;s unlikely to change.</p>
<p>The base model of the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes with 256GB of storage, and you can pick up the phone in 512GB and 1TB variants as well, with all three models featuring 8GB of RAM as standard — just like last year.</p><p>There isn&apos;t anything missing on the connectivity front either, with the phone offering Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, dual-band GPS, satellite connectivity (in select regions), and a second-gen UWM module. The USB-C charging port uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard and has the full 10Gbps bandwidth, and the best part is that it includes DisplayPort, giving you the ability to connect the phone to XR glasses like the RayNeo Air 2S and external monitors.</p><p>Similar to previous years, the vibration motor continues to be one of the best of any device, offering granular feedback when using the keyboard, navigating the interface, and other system events.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a bigger 4685mAh battery, and you get noticeable gains in daily use. I got an hour and a half of additional screen-time versus the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and that&apos;s a sizeable achievement in and of itself. The phone lasts a day even with heavy use, and most of the time, I averaged a day and a half between charges.</p><p>The charging situation is where things aren&apos;t any better. The iPhone 16 Pro Max takes an agonizing amount of time to charge, and while it gets to 45% in 30 minutes, it takes an additional 80 minutes to charge the battery entirely. While the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S24 Ultra don&apos;t have fast charging either, these devices don&apos;t take anywhere as long to charge, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max continues to lag behind its rivals.</p><p>Chinese brands are in a league of their own in this area, with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Vivo X100 Ultra taking under 45 minutes to charge their batteries. That said, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has an advantage with wireless charging, with MagSafe now going up to 25W. The phone also works with the Qi2 standard — something Android phones haven&apos;t gotten around to yet — and you can get 15W charging via a Qi2 stand.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max doesn&apos;t have drastically different camera hardware, with the phone using a similar 48MP main camera with sensor-shift OIS as last year. The 12MP telephoto lens is unchanged as well, and it delivers 5x optical zoom and OIS. There&apos;s now a 48MP wide-angle lens, and up front is a 12MP lens with OIS.</p><p>Camera Control is a key hardware addition this time, and while it is good to quickly pull up the camera and take a photo, the button isn&apos;t in the best location, and it isn&apos;t intuitive to use. After trying out the button for a week, I went back to adjusting viewfinder controls the usual way.</p><p>What you&apos;ll like better is the overhauled Photographic Styles, which now allows you to drastically change the look and feel of a photo. There are 15 preset tones you can use out of the box, but where the feature truly comes into its own is the ability to tweak these presets to your liking by changing the undertones and contrast selection. The result is that you get wildly different photos by switching up the tones, and there is extensive customizability in this regard.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve always enjoyed shooting macros with iPhones, and the 16 Pro Max lets you take high-res macro shots. Video is an area where the phone continues to dominate, and this year, you can shoot 4K in 120fps with HDR, and that&apos;s just incredible. The new ISP encoder able to handle the increased bandwidth, and what I like the most about this feature is that you can slow down footage to 60fps or 30fps after the fact via the built-in editor.</p><p>You can also record spatial audio, and it is enabled by default. What&apos;s cool about this feature is that you can then reduce background noise, or create a cinematic effect with ambient noises pushed to the background. You can do this by selecting Audio Mix in the editor, and it works incredibly well.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max doesn&apos;t deviate too much from its predecessor when it comes to color rendition, with resultant daylight shots having good white balance and color accuracy. You don&apos;t get saturated photos like Samsung&apos;s phones or the contrast-rich images that are a characteristic of Pixels. The phone does just as good a job in low-light conditions, but it is a bit aggressive with smoothening details. That said, the new Styles give you incredible customizability with tonal balance, and you can easily change the look of your photos. </p><p>The wide-angle lens is similarly great, and it doubles as a macro shooter, giving you the ability to take close-up shots. There is some noise in low-light shots taken with the wide-angle lens, and while it has good color rendition, it doesn&apos;t measure up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a> in this regard.</p><p>The zoom lens is relatively unchanged, and it manages to deliver clean shots at up to 5x. You get usable photos at 10x as well, but there&apos;s visible noise — more so than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Portraits are similarly great, and you get good background segmentation. That said, they&apos;re nowhere as detailed as the Vivo X100 Ultra or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>; these two devices still have a distinct edge when it comes to portrait shots.</p><p>Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does a better job than its predecessor, and it holds up incredibly well against the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Vivo&apos;s X100 Pro and X100 Ultra and the Find X7 Ultra are much better in low-light situations and portrait shots, but as an all-round package, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does more than enough to stand out against its rivals.</p>

<p>Apple introduced a ton of new features in iOS 18, but not all are available out of the box — all the AI-focused features will debut at a later time. There&apos;s an increased focus on customization this time, and much-needed updates to a lot of the stock apps. A big update includes RCS integration in Messages, something that took a long time to arrive. You get to use emoji or stickers with Tapback, the ability to schedule messages, and so much more, and while I don&apos;t use iMessage, it clearly has a lot going for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jMYJeCPxqyiyHiRp2f6aW9" name="iphone-16-pro-max-25.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max extended Control Center details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMYJeCPxqyiyHiRp2f6aW9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Control Center has much better customizability, and you can easily add and change toggles as needed. It has scrollable pages, and if you need additional widgets that don&apos;t fit into the default pane, you can set up additional ones according to your preferences. I didn&apos;t get much utility out of this feature as I like to limit the number of toggles I use, and most of my interactions are focused on the media player.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC" name="iphone-16-pro-max-28.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max tinted icons on the home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can now change icon size and choose between various styling options. There&apos;s the default light and dark, and automatic modes, and the tinted option in particular is interesting, as it gives you granular control in tweaking the colors of the icon. Unlike Google&apos;s Themed icons (which is still in beta), the iOS 18 implementation is consistent across all apps, and it works incredibly well. You can change lock screen controls as well, switching out the flashlight and camera toggles with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JHgnkPjNYtf9AGJXEMAZy9" name="iphone-16-pro-max-26.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JHgnkPjNYtf9AGJXEMAZy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, you get the ability to leave blank spaces between app icons on the home screen — something that was long overdue. The default Photos app has been overhauled and now uses collections-based sorting to organize your photos and videos, and you get better control in arranging your media library. iOS 18 also gives you the option to hide and lock apps behind Face ID, which is ideal with financial utilities or messaging clients.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iTPz5yqj256K6tLk9ugDVA" name="iphone-16-pro-max-27.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max extended Control Center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTPz5yqj256K6tLk9ugDVA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Apple Intelligence is a key addition to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and you get a suite of AI-enabled features around writing, image generation, and so much more. However, Apple Intelligence isn&apos;t available at the moment, and the initial set of AI features will go live starting October 28 in the U.S. with the iOS 18.1 update.</p><p>Customers in other countries have a lengthier wait, and not all features showcased at the launch event will be accessible immediately; there&apos;s going to be a staggered availability instead, and you&apos;ll need to wait until end of Q1 to get most of the AI features.</p><p>This is a unique situation; Apple usually has all of its features available on launch day, but because of the scale of the undertaking, the brand is taking its time — and that&apos;s something I can get behind. Most brands have been too hasty to introduce AI features, and they&apos;re half-baked at best. Having said that, you&apos;ll need to wait several months to unlock the full potential of the iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-the-competition"><span>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xiQzkBM5cbAGgGccwEM6CB" name="iphone-16-pro-max-30.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiQzkBM5cbAGgGccwEM6CB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the obvious alternative to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It feels like Google went out of its way to make the 9 Pro XL look like an iPhone, and it does a good job in that regard. You still get a distinctive camera housing at the back, but the flat sides and chunkier design makes it feel like an iPhone in everyday use. The 9 Pro XL doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of hardware, but it has an OLED panel that gets brighter, outstanding cameras, and the best AI features of any phone available today.</p><p>If you need a phone with plenty of power, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a good choice to consider as well. The software isn&apos;t as good as what you get on the Pixel — or the iPhone 16 Pro Max — but you get seven years of updates, and Samsung bundles a decent set of AI tools with Galaxy AI.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uEvqz8uoPtbpCCzWVmprB7" name="iphone-16-pro-max-18.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max back view against gold-colored background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEvqz8uoPtbpCCzWVmprB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an iPhone with a sizeable OLED panel</li><li>You want the best hardware on a phone</li><li>You need standout cameras</li><li>You want better battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest AI features</li><li>You need the best charging tech</li><li>You have an iPhone 15 Pro Max</li></ul>
<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a great phone that promises to get even better when Apple Intelligence becomes available. You don&apos;t need to wait until the AI features roll out if you&apos;re looking to upgrade from an older iPhone; there are enough new features to distinguish it from its predecessors. The most noticeable difference is the bigger OLED panel, and while it makes the phone even taller, it is a welcome upgrade.</p><p>But what you&apos;ll actually end up liking is the battery longevity; the iPhone 16 Pro Max lasts significantly longer than its predecessor, and that in itself is enough of an upgrade to entice older iPhone users to make the switch. Other battery-related tweaks should curb battery degradation — something that was a major issue on the iPhone 14 series — and while the charging situation is in need of an overhaul, 25W MagSafe is a decent workaround in the meantime.</p><p>There&apos;s little incentive to move if you&apos;re already using the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but if you&apos;re on an older device and are mulling an upgrade, you should get the iPhone 16 Pro Max. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The home laser projector market is seeing meteoric growth, and a big part of that push is the rise of Chinese manufacturers. Brands like XGIMI and Dangbei have made huge inroads into the west with their products, and AWOL Vision is another brand that&apos;s of particular interest. The brand&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-4k-ust-laser-projector-review">LTV-3000 Pro</a> is a standout choice, and after using it for nearly a year, I&apos;m convinced that it is one of the best UST projectors available today.</p><p>AWOL Vision is doing things slightly differently with its latest product launch; the manufacturer recently launched a sub-brand called Valerion, and it is rolling out the VisionMaster series. There are four products available: VisionMaster Plus, Plus 2, Pro 2, and Max. Valerion is taking the crowdfunded route with these projectors, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/valerionvisionmaster/valerion-visionmaster-cinematic-grade-rgb-laser-projector">turning to Kickstarter</a>.</p><p>What I like about the VisionMaster series is the design; the models have similar designs with metallic fins going around the chassis, and it looks pretty cool. There&apos;s also decent connectivity, and the usual table stakes features: auto keystone, autofocus, and obstacle avoidance.</p><p>The Plus is the basic model in the series; it delivers a projection of 1500 lumen, and is sold in a blue chassis. It is available for $1,199 now, which is a sizeable 40% discount from its retail price. The Plus 2 is the interesting choice in the series, offering a 2000-lumen projection and coming in at $1,499.</p>

<p>The VisionMaster Pro 2 is the one I&apos;m testing later this month, and this version goes up to 3000 lumen, has 0.9- 1.5:1 optical zoom, and is available for $2,099. To round out the portfolio, there&apos;s a Max model that also has the same 3000-lumen brightness, but it has a unique vertical lens switching system and Dynamic Iris, which automatically adjusts the lens to deliver the best contrast levels in any lighting condition.</p><p>Outside of the differences in brightness, all models share the same tri-laser light source, and are powered by MediaTek&apos;s MT9618 platform. They come with built-in Google TV, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and you get Dolby Vision integration as standard. Clearly, there is a lot to like with these projectors, and while Valerion is a new brand, it is owned by AWOL Vision, so that gives it some amount of legitimacy.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/valerionvisionmaster/valerion-visionmaster-cinematic-grade-rgb-laser-projector">head to Kickstarter</a> to get your hands on the VisionMaster series. The Plus, Plus 2, and Pro 2 will be going out to backers starting December 2024, with the Max available in May 2025.</p>

<ul><li>As we await the Galaxy S25 series launch, new details of the Galaxy S25 FE emerge.</li><li>A new report indicates Samsung might bring the Fan Edition phone in a slimmer form factor.</li><li>The company might opt for a thinner battery while maintaining the same screen size as the predecessor Galaxy S24 FE.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is probably prepping for the launch of the Galaxy S25 series as we just entered the fourth quarter of this year. While the Fan Edition isn’t technically part of the flagship series, a new report reveals some interesting information about the Galaxy S25 FE, including its name change and other specs.</p><p>The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30535">The Elec</a> (via tipster Abhishek Yadav on X) about the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE handset. It is believed to be slimmer this time and should tentatively be called Galaxy S25 Slim.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung's Galaxy S25 FE will reportedly launch as Galaxy S25 Slim, powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 chipset and sporting a 6.7-inch dynamic AMOLED display, to rival Apple's iPhone 17 Slim, says The Elec (Korean publication).#Samsung #GalaxyAI #GalaxyS25Slim<a href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1845477499532370400">October 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The publication has revealed Samsung is trying to make the handset thinner by choosing a thinner battery with a larger surface area to bring the next Fan Edition phone in a slimmer form factor. While the device would still carry a 6.7-inch display like the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, we should see a slimmer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a> overall.</p><p>According to the tipster Yadav, the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE/ Slim would use a MediaTek chipset instead of Qualcomm or Samsung's own Exynos, which would certainly be an interesting choice from the Korean tech giant. The chipset, in this case, is likely the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC. The device is also likely to be paired up against the rumored iPhone 17 Slim from Apple.</p>
<p>While these details certainly appear interesting, we recommend considering them with a pinch of salt. The launch is probably several months away, and that too in 2025.</p><p>The Elec further notes that the Galaxy S25 FE or Slim is still in the product development phase while Samsung is gearing up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series launch early next year. Interestingly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">some of the renders</a> of the upcoming flagship series have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">surfaced online</a>, revealing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">its design</a> and some of the specs through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4-hits-benchmark">leaked benchmark tests</a>.</p><p>Alongside the Fan Editon phone, the outlet has shared the Galaxy S25 series phones' screen sizes. The regular Galaxy S25 has a 6.2-inch screen, followed by a 6.7-inch screen for the Plus model and a massive 6.9-inch screen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. These screen sizes are, however, a tad bit larger than the existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> models.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is experimenting with a Quick View feature in Google Search in a limited test.</li><li>Users searching for online recipes can use Quick View to see ingredient lists, instructions, and more without clicking a webpage.</li><li>The experimental feature makes it easier to parse digital recipes, but makes it harder to find the original source of the content.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Search is excellent at making its highlighted results to your query so insightful that there&apos;s little need to click through to the original source it came from. The company uses things like Featured Snippets, AI Overviews, and more to pull content from webpages that are shown front-and-center in search results. Now, it&apos;s exploring using a feature called Quick View to show you a full recipe without needing to open the webpage. </p><p>The test was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-quick-view-button-on-recipes-38222.html" target="_blank">Search Engine Roundtable</a>, which documented how Quick View works. When you search for a recipe with Google, you&apos;ll see a collection of links in the results — that&apos;s normal and to be expected. What&apos;s new is that select recipes and sites will have a new "Quick View" icon overlayed on the thumbnail. If you click this button, a streamlined overlay appears with everything you need to complete the recipe, from ingredients to step-by-step instructions.</p><p>For those that have used a reader view before, the experimental Quick View feature works in a similar way. The idea is simple — provide a simple view for parsing recipes that can be increasingly hard to navigate on sites filled with ads and other distracting  elements. Of course, the benefit for Google is that Quick View keeps you on its search results page, rather than directs you to another site. </p><p>"We’re always experimenting with different ways to connect our users with high-quality and helpful information. We have partnered with a limited number of creators to begin to explore new recipe experiences on Search that are both helpful for users and drive value to the web ecosystem," a Google spokesperson told Android Central in an email. "We don’t have anything to announce right now.” </p><p>The spokesperson added that this is a limited, early-stage experiment. Additionally, the participating sites with recipes appearing in Quick View results reached agreements with Google to showcase their content. Though Google did not explicitly confirm that publishers are being paid for their recipes appearing in Quick View, it would stand to reason that these agreements include some form of compensation. </p><p>Google tests out new features in Search all the time, and being that this is a limited test, there&apos;s no way to know whether Quick View will become widely available in the future. It&apos;s easy to see how Quick View benefits Google and its users — Google gets to keep users on its search results pages, while users get to view streamlined recipes. However, to make this idea work at scale, the company would have to get recipe publishers to buy in. </p>

<p>Google, and search engines at large, initially served as a way to direct users to the webpage they were looking for. Advertisements and sponsored results are mixed in to drive revenue back to the search engine provider. However, in recent years, Google has tried the limit the need for users to navigate to the original source of content on the web. Through Featured Snippets and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">AI Overviews</a>, it hopes to answer your question before you need to quick through to a third-party site.</p><p>The company even went as far to say that it wants Google to "do the Googling for you" at its developer conference this year. Part of that involves the use of AI Overviews, which extract the key points of one or more articles that aim to answer your search query. However, AI Overviews and Feature Snippets work best with a specific question. For things like recipes, there needs to be another solution. That could, one day, become Quick View.</p><p>A natural concern for publishers is how they will be fairly compensated for the content they create that appears in Quick View. If there&apos;s no reason for a user to click through to the original webpage, there&apos;s no way for a site to earn advertising revenue. While it appears Google is compensating publishers at the moment, it&apos;s unclear if that will be the case forever. Another valid concern is that if publishers become dependent on Google, they&apos;ll lose bargaining power when creating future deals. </p><p>We&apos;ll have to see how it all plays out. For now, Quick View looks like a good idea, and participating publishers have reached an agreement with Google for their recipes to be included. </p>
