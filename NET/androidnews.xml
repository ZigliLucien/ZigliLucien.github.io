<h2 id="how-long-can-the-pixel-buds-pro-2-apos-s-battery-last-2">How long can the Pixel Buds Pro 2&apos;s battery last?</h2>
<p>Google presented the first model of the Pixel Buds in 2022, and now you can enjoy the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. But how long they last depends on what you do and don&apos;t do with them. Google promises that you get up to 1.5 hours of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation off, and you only need a five-minute charge for it. They are the first model to have a Google Tensor chip to power features such as Clear Calling and improve the battery life.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">In his testing, Android Central&apos;s Tshaka Armstrong mentions</a> that after wearing the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for eight hours with mixed-use, switching between ANC and transparency, listening to music, or just having them in his ears, he had 40% battery left at the end of the day. During his testing, he also discovered that while sitting at his desk, an hour of ANC used at 50% of max volume used roughly 20% of the battery in the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">earbud</a> and 10% in the left.</p><p>Google claims up to eight hours of listening time with ANC, but that leaves you with only 50% on the left side. Tshaka will do more testing in the future to get more numbers for real-world use since that doesn&apos;t add up.</p><p>The battery life for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is better than the original model since you get one more hour of listening time and 10 hours more of total listening time with the charging case with Active Noise Cancellation on. With it off, you get one more hour of listening time and 17 more hours of total listening time with the charging case.</p><p>Google also promises up to five hours of listening time with the charging case and up to 24 hours of listening time with the buds. If you&apos;re happy with the battery stats, the only thing left is to decide <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/what-color-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-should-you-buy">what color Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 you should buy</a>. You can choose from four great colors and listen to your favorite music while looking great.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-drain-your-earbuds-battery-faster-2">What can drain your earbuds battery faster?</h2>
<p>Everyone wants their earbuds&apos; battery to last as long as possible. However, some standard practices, such as listening to music at a high volume or with a lot of bass, can quickly drain the battery. So, the higher the volume, the more load you put on the battery.</p><p>You can also turn off extra settings, protect them from extreme temperatures, and keep them out of direct sunlight. If you drop the earbuds, that can also damage them, resulting in a faster battery discharge. So, whether you&apos;re using one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> or not, taking care of your earbuds is a must.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The new Google Pixel 9 represents a bit of a departure from its predecessor, offering not just a new look but a number of spec bumps that inch this phone closer to a "Pro" device. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not quite there, despite Google inflating the price by $100 to match some other competitors, but it gets close, offering plenty of fun AI features that users are sure to love (or ignore).</p><p>So what&apos;s new with the Pixel 9, how is it different from its Pro siblings, and is it worth getting over the cheaper Pixel 8 or the more expensive Pixel 9 Pro? Last year&apos;s phone was priced well at just $699, but has Google justified the price increase of its latest model?</p><p>After spending some time with the Pixel 9, I can confidently say that this is a very good phone, with enough power and good enough cameras to get the job done. The Pixel 9 may not be the most powerful phone out there, but it is good at what it does, and that should be enough for most people. And what&apos;s great is that you don&apos;t even need to pay for a subscription to experience some of its best AI features.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-pixel-9-series-boasts-a-faster-chip-brighter-screens-and-new-ai-features">announced</a> in early August 2024 during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google 2024 event</a> and went on sale on August 22. The phone starts at $799 for the 12GB/128GB variant, while the 256GB version is priced at $899. However, if you shop around enough, you will most likely find some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals" target="_blank">compelling Pixel 9 deals</a>.</p><p>The phone is available in four different colors: Peony (pink), Wintergreen (green), Obsidian (black), and Porcelain (silver/white).</p><p>Google sells the Pixel 9 in the following countries: U.S., Canada, U.K., Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.</p><p>Unlike the Pixel 9 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which receive a one-year free trial of Gemini Advanced, the Pixel 9 may only receive a one-month trial in regions where the offer is available.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-design"><span>Google Pixel 9: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qDtA2xuQDU4ADb44YoMAQD" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-11.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDtA2xuQDU4ADb44YoMAQD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> looks quite different from its predecessor, but many of the main design cues are still there. Notably, the camera visor is no longer connected to the device&apos;s frame; it&apos;s now a floating camera bar with an all-aluminum side and a rounded cutout for the dual camera system. In fact, the shape of the camera bar reminds me of the Pixel&apos;s rather large and bubbly Quick Settings button, which brings an unexpected level of cohesion.</p><p>One thing I was concerned about regarding the new Pixel 9 design was the new flat design, particularly the frame. After using phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, I&apos;ve become a bit weary of sharp edges as they tend not to play nice with my poor finger when handling the phones one-handed. Fortunately, that&apos;s not the case here, as the satin metal frame is surprisingly soft, and Google gave it a very slight curve where the frame meets the front and rear panels, which keeps the phone from digging into your pinky finger.</p>

<p>I do agree with Android Central&apos;s Phones editor, Nick Sutrich, who said in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 hands-on</a> the new design reminds him of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">the latest iPhones</a>, at least if you look at it from the front and the sides. In fact, whenever I use the Pixel 9 out and about, friends would comment on how similar it looks to an iPhone, even when looking at it from the back. They could go so far as to say Google "stole" the design, which I think is going a bit far, but the resemblance is a bit uncanny.</p><p>The phone is surprisingly comfortable to hold. Beyond its soft frame and somewhat slick glass panels, the phone is still fairly small despite being a couple of millimeters larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. Given its size, I wouldn&apos;t exactly put this among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small Android phones</a>, but the 6.3-inch OLED panel is handled well thanks to the minimal and uniform bezels. My only complaint is that despite not having the smallest bezels I&apos;ve dealt with, I find my finger accidentally activating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> pretty often. It&apos;s not a huge annoyance, but something to point out if you enable the feature.</p>

<p>I would also suggest investing in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9 case</a>. As nice as it is to feel your phone in its natural, naked state, this phone is just too slippery for its own good. There have been several times when I&apos;ve set it down on a surface, only to hear it fall onto the ground a mere minutes later. Fortunately, the aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 make the phone pretty tough, but I would rather not risk it any more than I should.</p>

<p>The OLED display looks great, and while I normally leave phones on Natural color mode, the Adaptive display mode doesn&apos;t overly saturate colors as I find on other phones. You will have to remember to turn on Smooth display to kick up to the 120Hz refresh rate, but once you do, it&apos;s smooth sailing.</p><p>The added brightness also means that viewing content outdoors should be no problem. Just make sure to slap on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors" target="_blank">Pixel 9 screen protector</a>, as I&apos;ve already noticed some very light scratches across the display on my unit. These scratches aren&apos;t really noticeable until I view it with the display off from a certain angle (but they&apos;re still enough to annoy me).</p><p>I also have no complaints so far about the new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which feels fast and accurate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-14.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> sports the same size display, it comes with a higher QHD+ resolution. However, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll miss it on this phone, which is only a FHD+ panel. Everything still appears sharp and content looks great. Would a higher resolution have been nice? Perhaps, but at this size, it doesn&apos;t really matter much, and the slightly smaller and just as costly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> has the same resolution.</p>
<p>Yet, while I find the display to be quite nice, others may not fare as well. Google still keeps the display at a particularly low PWM rate, meaning people that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> may find it difficult to use the display.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chipset isn&apos;t a huge upgrade over its predecessor, but that matters very little here. Coupled with 12GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 performs quite well when opening and juggling apps. I think most people buying this phone will be pleased with its performance, especially when it comes to AI tasks. I also haven&apos;t noticed the phone getting too warm when playing games like Honkai: Star Rail or Fall Guys, which is a good sign to me, although touch input does seem ever-so-slightly delayed at times.</p>

<p>The phone has pretty decent haptics and good audio, which doesn&apos;t surprise me. The dual stereo speakers sound very full, with plenty of depth and good bass response, while the haptics remain quite subtle when navigating the phone or when receiving notifications.</p><p>Storage is also a problem for the Pixel 9. The base model comes with just 128GB, which just seems small for a flagship phone in 2024. As such, after setting up the Pixel and moving apps and audio over from my daily driver, the Pixel told me I had used 90% of my available storage. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-still-cant-get-the-basics-right-on-pixels">pointed out</a> by Android Central senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> that have double this amount of storage, so the fact that the three Pixel 9 series phones start with 128GB is a bit ridiculous.</p><p>The Pixel 9 supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and Bluetooth 5.3, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/wi-fi-7-is-here-but-should-you-care">I personally don&apos;t own a Wi-Fi 7 router</a> and probably won&apos;t for some time, it&apos;s nice to see it here. I&apos;m also hoping we&apos;ll get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">proper Auracast support</a> soon, hopefully after Android 15 rolls around.</p><p>I am sad to see the lack of UWB support, meaning you can&apos;t take advantage of more powerful location-tracking features or digital car key functionality. Whether it&apos;s truly necessary remains to be seen, but it&apos;s one of the things setting this phone apart from its Pro siblings.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mdjwk9zUDLj8BpV4L2ZGwX" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-16.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 battery life" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdjwk9zUDLj8BpV4L2ZGwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I&apos;ve been quite impressed with the battery life so far. The phone easily lasts me until the end of the day, and I get around seven or eight hours of screen time, which is pretty good. Google claims 24+ battery life and even longer with Energy Saver (since that&apos;s kind of how it works), and while I haven&apos;t gotten more than a day of battery life, I imagine it will vary based on your usage.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are other aspects of the battery that I&apos;m less impressed by. The 27W charging is almost unbearably slow, which is something that has always annoyed me about Pixel phones. Unlike the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which charged up to 70% in just 30 minutes, the Pixel 9 takes the same amount of time to just reach 50%, although those figures are based on a 45W Google charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="exhBULrSUFiKmvkxr7f8pU" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-15.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/exhBULrSUFiKmvkxr7f8pU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t have a Google 45W charger, and my experience has been quite different, with the phone taking a bit longer to reach 50% and then having to wait another hour to get to full when using a 100W charger from Anker. Fortunately, 50% still lasts you a good amount of the day, but wired and wireless charging speeds fall behind many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> with fast charging capabilities.</p><p>You also won&apos;t find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2 wireless charging</a>.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-cameras"><span>Google Pixel 9: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4231px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4TXmJfVXGYaC89kvK8erVU" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-04.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4TXmJfVXGYaC89kvK8erVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4231" height="2380" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m normally quite impressed with Pixel cameras, and while images captured from the Pixel 9 aren&apos;t bad, they&apos;re not particularly remarkable to me. Images are detailed and crisp, and there&apos;s a great deal of dynamic range, even in lower lighting conditions.</p><p>That said, I do find that images sometimes lack that extra punch of vibrancy or saturation that I like, and as a result, sometimes photos can appear a bit dull. I&apos;ve also seen instances where the sky might get blown out, but this doesn&apos;t happen too often. Otherwise, images have nice natural bokeh, and Macro Focus takes it to another level by letting you get really close.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Pixel 9 still lacks a third rear camera. This becomes particularly clear when compared to the Galaxy S24, which is also priced at $799 and sports a third lens for 3x telephoto images. Sure, the Pixel takes pretty good images with up to 8x Super Res Zoom, but the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera limits the zoom capabilities when compared to the Pixel 9 Pro.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been comparing the camera to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which has been my main driver for the past couple of months. To my surprise, I find that I often prefer the Razr Plus over the Pixel 9, which is something I never thought I&apos;d say. Images from the Razr just have that extra bit of vibrancy that I like in images, even if the Pixel often brings more depth to photos. I also find that post-processing on the Pixel tends to make photos look a bit artificial, while the Razr tends to keep things a bit more natural, even with lighting.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=42fdc3e8-7c3c-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>

<p>Still, the added dynamic range on the Pixel 9 can help make certain details stand out better than they would on the Razr Plus 2024, which isn&apos;t as consistent on this front. The Razr also falls behind on low-light images, whereas the Pixel 9 retains plenty of detail.</p><p>The two phones sometimes trade blows depending on the lighting conditions, and I prefer many Razr images over the Pixel. That said, while Motorola has clearly put in some work to improve its foldable camera, the Pixel is much more consistent overall in its shots.</p>

<p>One cool feature I like to show off is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>, which lets the person taking a photo add themselves to the image after it&apos;s been taken. It&apos;s a very neat feature, and I&apos;ve seen some excellent examples that make it look pretty convincing that everyone was in the photo.</p><p>My example (below) is admittedly a bit different from what Google had in mind, and at first glance, it looks fine until you squint and realize something&apos;s off. The result isn&apos;t perfect, but capturing yourself twice in the same frame is a very cool effect that I wouldn&apos;t be able to replicate easily using photo editing applications.</p><p>For a more traditional use of Add Me, Nick Sutrich has seen a result from the feature with him and his family, and you can check it out on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro review</a>. It&apos;s a much better example, but even then, it takes a squint to realize something&apos;s off and that someone has essentially been added to the photo. Still, it&apos;s a very cool feature that I think many would find useful when the moment calls for it.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the Pixel 9 is still running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> as Google prepares to roll out stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its devices and others. It&apos;s a little odd that it didn&apos;t launch with the update, but it&apos;s not a huge deal. After all, Google was able to include plenty of new features on its Pixel 9 phones that we will likely see come to older Pixels down the road. The company is also extending its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven-year update promise</a> to the Pixel 9, which is good to see, even if you don&apos;t plan to keep the phone for that long.</p><p>The Pixel 9 supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> with Multimodality, meaning it can handle some pretty complicated stuff. I&apos;ve played around with a few of the new AI features, and so far, I&apos;m pretty impressed. Among them, Pixel Studio is probably my favorite new app. It&apos;s a text-to-image generator powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">Google&apos;s new Imagen 3 model</a>. It&apos;s pretty easy to use, allowing you to go into existing images available in the studio or to create your own from scratch.</p><p>The results are pretty damn impressive, and more often than not, they put a smile on my face. The app does quite well in generating clear, high-quality images, and the results can be spot-on, including how the app generates text like book or movie titles.</p>

<p>Of course, there have been some examples of both Pixel Studio and Reimagine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos">generating some unfavorable things.</a> However, Google is continuing to gain feedback and adjust things accordingly, so we should see much less of that when using these features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> is a useful way to record and transcribe calls, and it not only lets you replay the recording or search through the transcription, but the feature also summarizes the details of the call, in case you just need to remember what the gist of the conversation was.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Pixel Weather, which is a beautiful app that provides AI-generated reports of the rest of your day and what you can expect the following day, complete with weather animations. It does a decent job of covering the basic points of the forecast without overloading you with information, although I can see how some people would want even more detail. That said, I&apos;m not sure how useful the AI-generated reports are, as their main purpose seems to be to summarize the information already presented to you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nWBmaJnqaCTwXrBXQntggk" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-26.jpg" alt="The Pixel Weather app on the Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nWBmaJnqaCTwXrBXQntggk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of usefulness, I still can&apos;t find a reason to actually use the Pixel Screenshots app, as it&apos;s simply just a way to search screenshots and create AI summaries of them. My thing is that most of the screenshots I take are of funny memes or photos that I find interesting or need for work (which are used immediately), and it&apos;s rarely anything that I ever need to recall. I&apos;m sure some people will find it useful, and I may end up changing my mind as I continue testing the phone, but right now, it just feels a bit superfluous.</p><p>I will say that I&apos;m coming around to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>, although I also haven&apos;t found much use for it beyond having fairly mundane or asinine conversations. It actually sounds surprisingly natural in its responses and appears to understand my queries well, even if they&apos;re multilayered or if I&apos;m seemingly rambling a bit. I asked for some diet tips to achieve my goal weight, and it provided some sound advice. I then followed up by asking for exercises that could help, and it gave equally sound advice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gbE7NDe2Rut6zCprCEjsVE" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-24.jpg" alt="Gemini Live UI on the Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbE7NDe2Rut6zCprCEjsVE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, Gemini Live couldn&apos;t remember the weight goal I gave it just a day prior, so I had to remind it during follow-up queries. Basically, I can see this being a useful feature occasionally when you have very specific and multi-layered questions, but I already don&apos;t use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> very much, so I&apos;m not sure how much I would use Gemini or Gemini Live on a regular basis.</p><p>On the plus side, Gemini Live is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">no longer tied to Gemini Advanced</a> (which is locked behind a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscription). That means you can try it yourself to see just how useful it can be for you. Plus, the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini assistant</a> continues to gain more functionality, making it a more viable replacement for Google Assistant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3994px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="nEak9zPJYRAV3TWUPKyrNg" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-23.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nEak9zPJYRAV3TWUPKyrNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3994" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Google limits the Pixel 9 compared to its Pro siblings, and it&apos;s not clear why. Despite sporting the same Tensor G4 chip and 12GB of RAM, enough to handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, Google has omitted certain camera features from the base Pixel 9, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, Pro Controls, High-Res photos, and more.</p><p>When asked why there&apos;s such a feature disparity, Google couldn&apos;t provide a clear answer, making it seem as though it&apos;s just gatekeeping features for its more expensive phones. It&apos;s a bit unfortunate since I don&apos;t think Samsung does the same thing with the base Galaxy S24, and that only has 8GB of RAM.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-the-competition"><span>Google Pixel 9: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE" name="oneplus-12-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the base Pixel 9 model, there are a few other phones you can consider at or below this price point from companies like Samsung and OnePlus.</p><p>The base Galaxy S24 is the closest competitor to the Pixel 9, offering a similarly small, mostly flat chassis and comparable specs. One major difference is the presence of a telephoto camera, something the Pixel 9 lacks. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 comes with 12GB of RAM, which should make it more capable when it comes to on-device AI processing. It also has a larger battery, which should theoretically help it last longer on a single charge. Otherwise, both offer similar software promises and great camera quality for the same price.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is another similarly priced option for anyone looking for a flagship. As far as specs go, the phone bests the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S24 in many areas, sporting a larger battery, much faster charging, and up to 16GB of RAM. The downside to getting a OnePlus is that the software isn&apos;t for everyone, and support isn&apos;t as robust. The phone also isn&apos;t as water resistant, so you can&apos;t submerge it.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a new Google flagship without spending $1000.</li><li>You want the latest AI features on your phone before anyone else.</li><li>You want some of the best cameras on the market.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You own a Pixel 8.</li><li>You want a phone with fast charging capabilities.</li><li>You want a phone with a telephoto camera and Pro camera controls.</li></ul>
<p>I&apos;ve never been a big fan of Pixel phones, but after using the Pixel 9 for a month, I think that it&apos;s a great phone that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-or-pixel-9-pro">you should consider purchasing for your next upgrade</a>, especially if you&apos;re not trying to drop $1000 on a Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>Tensor G4 may not be the most powerful chip on the market, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">it&apos;s perfect for the Pixel</a> and how Google is positioning this phone, especially when paired with 12GB of RAM. Its performance is great, battery life is great, and you won&apos;t be disappointed by its cameras unless you&apos;re hoping for a telephoto lens with strong zoom capabilities.</p><p>Yes, the Pixel 9 still doesn&apos;t get all the features you&apos;ll find on the Pro phones, and that&apos;s a problem. If you think you would want some of those missing features, then you <em>should</em> spring for the Pro phones. Otherwise, the Pixel 9 is still a good phone if you can stomach the $100 premium over its predecessor.</p>

<p>Apple&apos;s iPhone 16 lineup is finally official, and it&apos;s all set to go against Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series and other heavy hitters of the Android world. As has been the case for the past few years, both manufacturers have launched multiple smartphones, but we&apos;re going to be focusing specifically on the &apos;Plus&apos; models, namely the iPhone 16 Plus and the Galaxy S24 Plus.</p><p>Comparing Apple iPhone 16 Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus makes perfect sense, as these are two of the best high-end phones available in the market right now. Each offers top-of-the-line hardware specifications, AI-enhanced software features, and a truckload of other goodies. But as stacked as both of these devices are, which one of them is a better value for money? Let&apos;s find out.</p>
<h2 id="apple-iphone-16-plus-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-design-and-display-2">Apple iPhone 16 Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus: Design and display</h2>
<p>Barring a few changes, both the Apple iPhone 16 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus are virtually identical to their respective predecessors. This isn&apos;t meant to be a criticism; there&apos;s only so many ways you can design a rectangular slab, and these are still two very premium and well-built smartphones. Both feature flat front and back panels (made by Corning), a brushed aluminum frame, as well as an IP68 rating for ingress protection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1260px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="ZxqXhqbXN26Qsqc2ULxDke" name="apple iphone 16 plus all color options.jpg" alt="apple iphone 16 plus all color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZxqXhqbXN26Qsqc2ULxDke.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1260" height="708" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S24 Plus has a triple-lens rear camera setup with the lenses arranged vertically, similar to the last-gen model. The iPhone 16 Plus sports a dual-lens camera system with a similar lens arrangement, ditching the diagonal lens layout of the previous-gen model. With the iPhone 16 Plus, you also get the new &apos;Camera Control&apos; pad, as well as the customizable &apos;Action Button&apos; that debuted with the iPhone 15 Pro and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review" target="_blank">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.</p>
<p>Although both Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus and Apple iPhone 16 Plus have absolutely gorgeous 6.7-inch OLED panels, only the former&apos;s display uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-does-ltpo-mean-and-why-is-it-important-on-your-device" target="_blank">LTPO technology</a> for better energy efficiency. The screen on the Galaxy S24 Plus also has a faster 120Hz refresh rate, and its slimmer bezels allow the smartphone to have a slightly smaller physical footprint.</p>
<h2 id="apple-iphone-16-plus-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-hardware-and-cameras-2">Apple iPhone 16 Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus: Hardware and cameras</h2>

<p>To no one&apos;s surprise, both smartphones come with the absolute best in terms of hardware. While the iPhone 16 Plus is helmed by Apple&apos;s homegrown A18 (3nm) chip and has 8GB of RAM, the Galaxy S24 Plus is driven by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (4nm) SoC and packs 12GB of RAM. The former can be had with up to 512GB of internal storage, while the latter is available with up to 1TB of onboard storage.</p><p>So, what do these specifications mean? To put it simply, blazing-fast performance. Whether it&apos;s multitasking, 4K video recording, or playing resource-heavy titles like Genshin Impact, the iPhone 16 Plus and the Galaxy S24 Plus rank up there with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> available in the market. These hardware specifications also power the various AI-based features (discussed later) that the two smartphones are packed with.</p>

<p>Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus and Apple iPhone 16 Plus have all kinds of connectivity and I/O options including multi-band 5G, Bluetooth 5.3, and USB Type-C with DisplayPort functionality.</p><p>Coming to cameras, now this is where things are a bit different. The iPhone 16 Plus features a dual-lens rear camera setup with a 48MP main sensor and a 12MP ultrawide module. The main &apos;Fusion&apos; sensor can capture full-resolution photos or use sensor crop to shoot 2x &apos;optical-quality&apos; zoom images, whereas the ultrawide module can also capture macro photos.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus, on the other hand, comes with a proper triple-lens primary camera system having a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultrawide module, and a 10MP ultrawide unit with 3x optical zoom. Of course, the camera arrays on both of these smartphones are complemented by a wide range of software-based features such as auto HDR, live photos, creative image filters, editing tools, and more.</p>

<p>We already know that the Galaxy S24 Plus is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> out there, and even though it&apos;s probably too early to comment, the iPhone 16 Plus is quite likely to have a comparable camera performance as well. However, there&apos;s no denying that among the two, the Galaxy S24 Plus has a more versatile camera setup. No matter how good things like &apos;Fusion&apos; and &apos;Camera Control&apos; are, you just can&apos;t beat a dedicated telephoto sensor.</p>
<h2 id="apple-iphone-16-plus-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-software-and-battery-2">Apple iPhone 16 Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus: Software and battery</h2>
<p>Running iOS and Android, respectively, the iPhone 16 Plus and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> are different yet similar when it comes to their software. Sure, these are competing operating systems we&apos;re talking about, but both platforms have matured quite a lot, thanks to years of continued development. As far as things like app support, data security, and general user experience are concerned, you can&apos;t go wrong with either of the two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N7Nvx7CVWYiToqZw8BHgM9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-translate-messages-official-01.jpg" alt="An official Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus promo image showcasing the message translate feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N7Nvx7CVWYiToqZw8BHgM9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s AI, because it&apos;s 2024 and every single gadget needs to have some kind of AI functionality baked into it. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus and Apple iPhone 16 Plus have their own collections of AI-based tools, clubbed under the monikers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-ai" target="_blank">Galaxy AI</a> and Apple Intelligence, respectively. These enable things like live translation of calls, summarizing of textual content, and more.</p><p>While I still find the majority of these AI-powered features to be a bunch of hogwash, your mileage may vary. However, even if you do like them, it&apos;s worth noting that only Galaxy AI is available as of writing this article. If you prefer Apple Intelligence, you&apos;ll have to wait until later this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:980px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="bjSYbDdHEXshVsmcktidUG" name="apple intelligence feature highlights.jpg" alt="apple intelligence feature highlights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bjSYbDdHEXshVsmcktidUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="980" height="551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, let&apos;s talk about endurance. As noted by Android Central&apos;s Derrek Lee <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review" target="_blank">in his review</a>, the Galaxy S24 Plus comes with a 4,900mAh battery that can easily keep the phone running for an entire day. When you do need to top it up, there&apos;s support for 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging.</p><p>Conversely, the iPhone 16 Plus sports a slightly smaller 4,674mAh battery, but given the energy-efficient hardware, the phone should last quite a while before needing to be juiced up. You get support for 20W wired charging and up to 25W wireless charging with &apos;MagSafe&apos; as well.</p>
<h2 id="apple-iphone-16-plus-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-which-should-you-buy-2">Apple iPhone 16 Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus: Which should you buy?</h2>
<p>Apple iPhone 16 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus are both exceptional mobile devices. They offer premium hardware, top-tier software, class-leading cameras, and just about everything else you could possibly want in a modern-day flagship. With iOS finally allowing home screen customization and Android now offering years of platform updates, the operating systems that power these two smartphones have achieved sufficient feature parity as well. So, the question is, which one should you go for?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rWQcJWAiQR89YC4cFXV3vJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-lockscreen-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rWQcJWAiQR89YC4cFXV3vJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s our take! With a starting price of $899, the iPhone 16 Plus is the ideal choice if you&apos;re already comfortable with Apple&apos;s ecosystem and want things to stay that way. The phone has industry-leading performance, customizable physical controls, and the build quality is just amazing.</p>
<p>But if you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/switching-iphone-android" target="_blank">switch from iOS to Android</a>, or simply don&apos;t care about platforms and just want the most bang for your bucks, then the Galaxy S24 Plus is clearly the overall winner. Sure, it does have a higher starting price of $999, but those extra $100 give you a smartphone with a much better and power-efficient display, twice the storage, and a superior primary camera system.</p>

<p>Gmail on Android is picking up a smarter, contextual update for those crafting quick messages on the fly.</p><p>Google is refreshing the "smart replies" feature in Gmail with a Gemini upgrade. As noted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/09/contextual-smart-replies.html" target="_blank">Workspace update</a>, their AI model is enhancing Gmail&apos;s replies to be more contextual. This means you&apos;ll get smarter responses that pack in more information and personality when you need it.</p><p>Google states smart reply&apos;s contextual version will deliver "more detailed responses to fully capture the intent of your message."</p><p>When crafting a reply, the post states users will notice a few message suggestions (provided by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>) regarding the current thread of messages. Users can hover over each suggestion and see what Gemini could send on your behalf. An edit button will be available if you enjoy an AI suggestion but would like to change certain aspects.</p><p>These "contextual" replies will likely consider extra bits of information like dates, times, places, and more. The post states Google wanted to give users more options for quicker, basic replies that are nothing more than acknowledgment.</p><p>This feature is preparing to roll out for Workspace customers with the Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, and Education Premium add-ons. Those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> will receive this as well.</p><p>Users on rapid and scheduled release domains started receiving it on September 26. Contextual smart replies by Gemini in Gmail will continue to arrive for users over the next 15 days.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s Gemini has continued to spread its influence in Gmail. Recently, the app picked up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-q-and-a-gmail-android-timesaver">new "Q&A" feature</a> powered by the model, which makes email searching a breeze. Users can ask Gemini to surface emails left unread from the day or week. The AI can also scour through your messages to find the status of an order you&apos;re waiting on.</p><p>Similarly to contextual smart replies, users can craft unique commands for Gemini to search in Gmail. Using it will let users tell Gemini to find messages from a specific person or contact.</p><p>Searching for the words to say can be difficult, so Google brought in Gemini to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmails-new-gemini-feature-turns-messy-notes-into-polished-emails-in-a-snap">bolster the "Help me write" tool</a>. An update in August rolled out the AI to help "polish" your drafted emails. Essentially, users can scribble in some rough notes in a draft and let Gemini sort it out and make them presentable.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Meet is set to be removed from Android TV and Google TV devices, as indicated by an APK teardown.</li><li>The app remains functional on Android TV at the moment, but users should start scouting for alternatives just in case.</li><li>The app likely didn’t gain much traction since most TVs lack built-in cameras and microphones, requiring extra devices for calls.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;ve been loving video calls on your Android TV with Google Meet, brace yourself for a switch. Google Meet is apparently getting the boot from Android TV and Google TV devices, so you might need to hunt for new video conferencing options soon.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-meet-android-tv-deprecation-apk-teardown-3485766/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>’s deep dive into the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet">Google Meet</a> update hints that Google is about to pull the plug on the app on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv">Android TV</a>. The wording in the code makes it pretty clear that this change is coming soon.</p><p>Based on some pretty telling code strings found in the update, Google Meet is likely being fully yanked from Android TV.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-apacheconf" language="apacheconf" ><code><string name="atv_deprecation_body">Soon you won't be able to use Google Meet on your Android TV to make calls. Click below for alternatives and to learn more.</string>
<string name="atv_deprecation_title">Meet on Android TV is going away</string></code></pre>
<p>Google Meet, which used to be Duo, was introduced to Android TV back in 2020. It allows users to hop on video calls on the big screen by connecting a webcam to their TV.</p><p>There’s been no official word from Google on this change yet. Android Central has reached out for a comment and will update the post when we get a response.</p><p>The Google Meet app is still working on Android TV for now, but it’s a good idea for users to start looking for backup options, just in case it gets removed.</p><p>The Google Meet app on Android TV probably didn’t get much love since using its features demands a decent investment. Most TVs don’t come with built-in microphones or cameras, so users need to plug in external devices for video calls.</p><p>Google Meet isn’t new to getting the boot from TV platforms. Earlier this year, it was taken off Samsung TVs, which was probably the first hint that Google was planning to phase out the app on TVs altogether.</p><p>With Google Meet’s likely exit from Android TV, plenty of users who rely on it for video calls are going to feel the sting. Whether it’s for meetings or staying connected with loved ones, that easy TV setup will be missed.</p>

<ul><li>Code within the recent Google Messages beta shows the company's plans to upgrade the app with spam detection for international texts.</li><li>The feature could come in the form of a "Cross-Country" folder, which may function similarly to the current Spam & Blocked bin.</li><li>Google recently rolled out Gemini in Messages to more devices and added texting with 911 through RCS-enabled chats over the summer.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A deep dive into Google&apos;s messaging app may hold a few clues about some upcoming extra protection against spam.</p><p>Code in the recent beta build for Google Messages shows the company is working on a "cross-country" spam folder. The unreleased feature has been spotted by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-cross-country-3485507/">Android Authority</a>) in the app&apos;s recent <strong>messages.android_20240923_01_RC00</strong> beta version.</p><p>There are multiple strings within the app&apos;s beta code about this new cross-country folder and its uses. Google&apos;s early description of the function states international messages from "non-contacts" will be placed in a new cross-country "folder."</p><p>However, if you received a message from a person, business, or anyone else, there may be options to move those texts. Messages shows options to shift texts from cross-country to your inbox. Additionally, it seems Google will deliver more insight about the feature through a "why is this message here" button.</p><p>The publication suggests Google could implement different detection parameters for overseas messages to improve its spam detection and avoid false positives. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q5z7wdpDeFQNn6hVd5hTpH" name="pixel-google-messages-oops.jpg" alt="Pixel Google Messages Oops" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5z7wdpDeFQNn6hVd5hTpH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Spam detection and "prevention" is a feature within Messages called "Spam & Blocked." Texts from senders that the app deems spam-worthy will be tossed into this inbox variant. The app already notifies users of a new message in Spam & Blocked in case it got it wrong, so perhaps we&apos;re looking at something similar for "Cross-Country."</p><p>What&apos;s more, an option in <strong>Google</strong> <strong>Messages > Settings > Spam Protection</strong> lets you toggle this feature on or off. The tipster discovered that Google may give users a toggle for international spam, as well, to keep user agency at play.</p><p>Spam detection for overseas texts is likely taking more time to develop as the tipster didn&apos;t have much to say about its potential launch.</p><p>New happenings in Messages have been relatively quiet aside from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-finally-available-for-more-android-phones-in-messages">Gemini becoming available</a> for more people. The AI model is available in the app for devices with at least 6GB of RAM. Its use and experience mirrors that of the app or web-based version. Gemini in Messages lets users draft ideas, plan an upcoming event, and more.</p><p>Additionally, Google Messages also welcomed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-announces-911-rcs-texting-to-android">texting with 911 authorities</a> via RCS-enabled chats.</p>

<p>Vivo just hit a big milestone by being the first to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its users, with Funtouch OS 15 now rolling out to a few flagship phones, leaving Google and Samsung in the dust.</p><p>Ishan Agarwal’s scoop on X (formerly Twitter) says Vivo is pushing out the stable version of Funtouch OS 15, based on Android 15, to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">Vivo X Fold 3 Pro</a>, and iQOO 12 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/vivo-rolling-out-android-15/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My vivo X Fold3 Pro just received Android 15 update.Crazy how Vivo is the 1st major brand to be rolling out this out to their flagships. Not even Google Pixel has stable update yet.Hoping for a just as good of an experience with FuntouchOS 15. Good job @Vivo_India. #Android15 pic.twitter.com/f4oSkKxfy1<a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1839685950798254427">September 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google and Samsung have usually led the charge when it comes to Android updates, with Pixel phones often being the first to get new versions. But even though the search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-is-officially-launching-on-pixel-phones-near-you">recently dropped Android 15 to the Android Open Source Project</a>, there’s been a noticeable lack of updates for the Pixel lineup.</p><p>In a surprising twist, some Vivo users have already started receiving the Funtouch OS 15 update a few days ago, even though its official release was set for September 30.</p><p>In theory, any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> brand could&apos;ve pulled off what Vivo did, thanks to Google making the Android 15 source code available on the AOSP at the start of September. This means any company can jump in and start creating their own customized versions of Android 15.</p><p>Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series is on standby for the Android 15 update, which is likely to drop in mid-October. Meanwhile, Samsung hasn’t revealed anything about the One UI 7 beta update.</p><p>Vivo&apos;s Funtouch OS 15 has added several AI-powered tools for its flagship devices, including an AI Eraser in the Gallery that’s expected to work like Google Photos’ Magic Editor, a shadow removal tool, and Live Transcribe.</p><p>The updated software also steps up user privacy and connectivity with new perks like partial screen sharing and satellite connectivity support. The update is being rolled out in phases, so all eligible devices will be getting it over the next few days.</p><p>While the Android 15 beta is out now, it’s not the final version just yet. If Google doesn’t wrap things up quickly, a few more manufacturers might just beat it to delivering stable Android 15 updates on their devices.</p>

<p>Everyone who watched Meta Connect was understandably excited by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion AR glasses prototype</a>. Still, its most consumer-ready feature had nothing to do with glasses themselves; it&apos;s the electromyography (EMG) band controller for reading neural signals that I expect to see soon on store shelves or in Quest boxes.</p><p>Meta&apos;s EMG tech is too good to be a mere accessory, though; it should be the centerpiece for a Meta watch or tracker. And we already have evidence Meta is working on a watch.</p><p>Anyone who heard Mark Zuckerberg say on stage that Meta&apos;s EMG band allows you to "send a signal from your brain to the device" via a "neural interface" may have gotten visions of some creepy mind-reading tech, but it&apos;s fairly straightforward.</p><p>Right now, a smartwatch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> can detect hand gestures like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-apple-watch-double-tap-on-galaxy-watch-6">double taps</a> or fists by using the HR monitor and accelerometer/ gyroscope. A VR headset (like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a>) or AR glasses use computer vision to interpret pinch gestures for hand-tracking controls. Either way, you get missed inputs or false positives.</p><p>An EMG band cuts out the visual or tactile middleman. If you make a pinching gesture, your brain sends a neural signal to your hands to trigger this. The band perceives that you&apos;re pinching your fingers even if they barely move, so tracking errors are unlikely and you don&apos;t have to exaggerate the motion. </p>

<p>It worked perfectly well in our hands-on Orion glasses demo, proving EMG isn&apos;t just some gimmick. And there&apos;s no actual brain reading required; it just reads the neural signals in your arm.</p><p>Samsung and Apple love using gestures to make their smartwatches look futuristic and accessible, but I rarely use them on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> because elaborate fist- or wrist-shaking to dismiss calls or open apps feels a bit too finicky and annoying to remember.</p><p>A Meta smartwatch with the right EMG shortcuts would make the big watch brands look amateurish, and allow subtler shortcuts that wouldn&apos;t feel as awkward.</p><p>Such a watch could offer other sensors <em>besides</em> electromyography, too. I&apos;ve thought for years that Meta needs to make a fitness tracker, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3-mixed-reality-is-tailor-made-for-fitness">how popular Quest headsets are for fitness</a>. Quest headsets guess vaguely how many calories you&apos;ve burned based on head and arm movements, but actual heart rate data viewable in-headset during exercise routines would be fantastic. Or imagine if these exercise games could use your live HR data to decide to make the tempo harder or easier.</p><p>The big question, of course, is software. Meta has plenty of iPhone-using fans and has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">contentious relationship with Google over XR software</a>; a Wear OS watch is unlikely, in other words. So would a Meta wearable OS without serious mobile integration and third-party apps be viable? Can it catch up for both traditional smarts and fitness training plans to compete in a crowded market?</p><p>I don&apos;t have the answer to those questions, but I know Meta has been working on smartwatch tech on and off for years.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-milan-smartwatch-shelved">canceled its first Project Milan smartwatch prototype</a>. A Bloomberg report revealed that the watch lasted 18 hours per charge, had a 5MP camera mounted to the watch face, and a 12MP camera built into the bottom that you could use by detaching the watch face.</p><p>It had Wi-Fi, LTE, and GPS tracking, as well as "daily activity tracking, workouts, the photo gallery, heart rate monitoring, calendar, settings, and breathing." It had popular Meta apps like Instagram and WhatsApp built in, and cost $349. </p><p>Allegedly, the biggest hang-up Meta had with this prototype was that the bottom camera "caused issues with another feature for translating nerve signals from the wrist into digital commands." In other words, Meta killed the whole project because the EMG tech didn&apos;t work with the design.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23454019/meta-portal-smartwatch-efforts-shutting-down-hardware">The Verge</a>, Meta began working on two new smartwatch prototypes that year. But by November 2022, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-abandoning-smartwatch-portal-development">killed both designs and its Portal smart displays</a> while laying off 11,000 employees.</p>

<p>The following year, we learned from tipster Kamila Wojciechowski that Meta had allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-meta-smartwatch-reportedly-in-development">restarted in-house smartwatch development</a>, using Android software (not Wear OS) and a Qualcomm CPU. The new design had some sensor changes, but may have kept the detachable watch face for taking photos.</p><p>After that, it was mostly radio silence from Meta on the smartwatch front; instead, Zuckerberg bragged about their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-says-neural-interface-controls-are-close-to-ready">new EMG band in a 2024 podcast</a>, saying it would be "in a product in the next few years."</p><p>But last month, leaker Evan Blass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1825260438483075152">posted on X</a> a list of Meta Quest project codenames, and said a source claimed one "may be a watch, I&apos;m told -- the follow up to a killed model codenamed Milan -- while the Vegas are tipped as two generations of budget Quest headsets." The Vega 1 and 2 did turn out to be the 128GB and 256GB Meta Quest 3S, giving this some legitimacy.</p>

<p>My colleague Nick Sutrich asked the Meta Orion team about the possibility of the EMG tech appearing in a smartwatch design, particularly one with fitness capabilities. </p><p>"Right now our focus is on using MEG technology for wearables like smart and AR glasses, but it has the potential to be the best way to control any device," they answered.</p><p>That puts a bit of a damper on my hopes of an EMG-powered smartwatch in the near future. At the moment, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview">The Verge</a>&apos;s sources claim that Meta "will start selling [the EMG band] soon," but for another AR glasses prototype called Hypernova.</p><p>Still, if Meta really is working on a new smartwatch, I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised if the EMG band would be its way of standing out from the pack, more than cameras that couldn&apos;t take high-res, on-the-go photos as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta&apos;s own Ray-Ban glasses</a> (or any smartphone).</p><p>The EMG band can still be a standalone controller for smart glasses, but paired with watch tech, it would help Meta start to form its own family of devices like other big tech brands offer.</p>

<p>Four of the five cases were unanimous decisions, while the case against Ryter was authorized 3-2, with Commissioners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/dissenting-statement-commissioner-melissa-holyoak-joined-commissioner-andrew-n-ferguson-matter-rytr">Melissa Holyoak</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/dissenting-statement-commissioner-andrew-n-ferguson-joined-commissioner-melissa-holyoak-matter-rytr">Andrew Ferguson</a> voting against taking action. The FTC makes it very clear it will not tolerate "unfair or deceptive practices in these markets, [and] is ensuring that honest businesses and innovators can get a fair shot and consumers are being protected.”</p>
<p>It&apos;s about time, I say. I&apos;m very familiar with the weirdly inaccurate terms <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-leveraging-machine-learning-make-duo-calls-sound-better">machine learning</a> and AI. I understand the strong points of software that can use one sort of information to present a different sort, and I understand how useful it can be. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">I also hate reading and writing about AI</a> because of its reckless addition to everything and the actual harm it brings.</p><p>I&apos;m not talking about smart robots that destroy humanity or how people with bad intentions can do bad things using AI instead of other tools. I&apos;m talking about how AI can be used to trick even the most tech-savvy among us and how this happens every day.</p>

<p>These five cases from the FTC showcase why AI is bad. AI will never replace a living, breathing lawyer, and the claims that it can are simply lies. People who believed those lies were not properly represented when they took it upon themselves to appear in front of judges without an actual attorney.</p><p>AI is not able to build an online storefront that will make you millions. That requires hard work from you and a great idea or a large gift of cash from your parents. AI can write fake reviews for products to try and manipulate potential buyers, but that&apos;s not legal. None of these five businesses have any right to exist because they prey on consumers with bogus promises and deceptive schemes. The FTC says these companies were using AI to "turbocharge deception" and I could not say it any better.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that it took this long for a small sample of offensive companies who used the AI buzzword to steal money from the unsuspecting public. I&apos;d also like to see much harsher penalties, so I guess I have a second complaint.</p><p>I do understand at least part of the problem, though. It seems like everyone is sitting around waiting for some magical AI regulations to happen at the federal level. While waiting, it seemed that nothing was being done using existing laws to weed out the predators. Again, I also realize I&apos;m not a lawyer and have no idea what it takes to build a solid case against a business, and an AI lawyer is very vague on the subject.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:729px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.38%;"><img id="nCBgSvnguYP9iKdTxmZ4EB" name="AI-lawer.jpg" alt="AI replies are bad." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCBgSvnguYP9iKdTxmZ4EB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="729" height="360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We need some common sense federal AI regulations. Not the kind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/california-ai-bill-makes-companies-liable-for-users">that causes undue levels of bureaucracy</a> and red tape or the kind that stifles honest innovation, but the kind that protects consumers like you and me against deceptive businesses like the ones mentioned by the FTC. I have no idea if that can ever happen with the current level of division between political parties, but I have my doubts. We&apos;ll have to settle for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">executive orders</a> in the meantime.</p><p>Until then, using the laws that already exist to protect us from fraud sounds like a grand plan. Deceptive business practices don&apos;t become less deceptive because AI wrote the web page that describes them. The people committing the potential fraud will do it with or without AI, just like people who make fake political ads.</p><p>If we get that sorted out, maybe we can start using AI to do a few good things instead of constantly bickering about how bad it is.</p>

Among these early offers is a discount that slashes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B09BG56K7R" target="_blank"><strong>54% off on the Amazon Fire HD 8 (2022) tablet</strong></a>, bringing an already-affordable device down to under $60 — and to its lowest price ever.</p><p>The Fire HD 8 is really nothing special on the performance side, but at this price, it may be a good option for kids or casual users who just want a basic tablet. It&apos;s worth noting that this version comes with lockscreen ads, though it also includes 64GB of storage or 1TB of expandable storage via a microSD slot.</p><p>Even if the Fire HD 8 isn&apos;t quite what you&apos;re looking for, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale"><strong>Amazon&apos;s early deals</strong></a> include a handful of deals on tablets, phones, and other devices. Again, Amazon is also holding its next Big Deal Days sale on October 8th and 9th, which will undoubtedly feature a lot of great tech discounts for Prime members. Haven&apos;t joined up yet? Sign up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> and you&apos;ll enjoy all of the benefits of the sale without paying a dime. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-review">2022 Amazon Fire HD 8</a> is an impressive 54% off for a limited time, weeks ahead of the upcoming Prime Day sale. Don't expect a high-performance tablet with this effort from Amazon, but those wanting something cheap and basic certainly won't mind this price point.</p>
<p>This Fire HD 8 includes 64GB of storage and 13 hours of battery life, though it also comes with lockscreen ads.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B09BG56K7R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f06bc46a-a7b3-46c1-87fe-cf7a3c7b2583" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$129.99" data-dimension48="$129.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a casual user looking for a cheap tablet or couch companion; you have other Amazon services that you regularly use; you need a tablet that&apos;s small and lightweight.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a high-performance tablet; you want easy access to more than just what the Amazon App Store has to offer; you need something with fast charging.</p><p>The affordability of the Amazon Fire HD 8 is probably its biggest strength, perhaps even making this the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">best Amazon tablet</a> there is. Despite its performance being pretty basic, it also boasts 13 hours of battery life and easy access to Alexa and the Amazon ecosystem. It&apos;s a great option for kids or those who just need another device around, featuring 2MP cameras, a USB-C port, and easy-to-set parental controls.</p><p>The cons of this cheap Amazon tablet are that it only has 2GB of RAM, so performance is really nothing special, and it doesn&apos;t feature fast charging despite featuring a USB-C port. Still, you&apos;re unlikely to find anything this good at such a low price, and it&apos;s hard to say how long this deal will stick around.</p>
