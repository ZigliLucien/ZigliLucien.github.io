                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>AWOL Vision isn&apos;t a brand that would be familiar to many; I didn&apos;t hear of the brand until last year, when I was researching ultra short throw (UST) projectors with a high brightness. While most brands have a selection of products — mostly aimed at the budget and mid-range tiers — AWOL Vision does things a bit differently; it only sells UST laser projectors, and given the tech on offer, they&apos;re aimed at the high-end segment.</p><p>I used a half-dozen UST projectors over the course of the last five years, and there has been a steady increase of new entrants rolling out enticing new features in the last 18 months. AWOL Vision&apos;s LTV series stands out because of Dolby Vision; there aren&apos;t many UST projectors that offer the feature, so I was automatically interested in taking a look at what the brand is doing in this category.</p><p>The only other projector I tested that had Dolby Vision was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-horizon-ultra-4k-projector-review">XGIMI Horizon Ultra</a>, but it was a regular laser projector. What makes AWOL Vision&apos;s LTV-3000 Pro all the more alluring is that it uses UST tech, so you can position it right up against a wall and still get a large image. I used the LTV-3000 Pro for just over three months now, and here&apos;s what I think of the UST projector.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-pricing-and-release-date"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Pricing and release date</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RbX6fSZpgzmZUDATUm6XUG" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-11.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RbX6fSZpgzmZUDATUm6XUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AWOL Vision unveiled the LTV-3000 Pro in December 2023, and the projector is now available in select global markets. It retails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AWOL-VISION-LTV-3000-Projector-Theater/dp/B0CR13MB4F">for $3,999 on Amazon U.S.</a>, but you can get $500 off, bringing the cost down to $3,499. The LTV-3000 Pro sits in the middle of AWOL Vision&apos;s portfolio; the base variant is the LTV-2500, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AWOL-VISION-LTV-3000-Projector-Theater/dp/B0B6HXCMQJ">available for $2,599</a> as of writing. There&apos;s a high-end model dubbed LTV-3500 Pro that has 3,500 lumens of brightness, and that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AWOL-VISION-LTV-3000-Projector-Theater/dp/B0CR15NXFD">currently retailing for $5,599 on Amazon</a>.</p><p>All three models have the same design and connectivity, and the only difference is the brightness of the projection; the LTV-2500 goes up to 2,600 lumens, and the LTV-3500 Pro hits 3,500 lumens. You get Dolby Vision and a 4K projection as standard, and plenty of customizability when it comes to color balance and picture modes.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-design"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ptfs7rKeTHZXcLgrWgg3uD" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-12.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ptfs7rKeTHZXcLgrWgg3uD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LTV-3000 Pro has a bold design that immediately grabs attention. I previously used the XGIMI Aura as my go-to UST projector, and while it also has a distinct styling, it doesn&apos;t look quite as futuristic. The smooth lines combined with the liberal use of metal trim gives the LTV-3000 Pro a lot of visual flair, and I love the way the projector curves around the front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nJUdKngEp78jkFdTQNd3TC" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-3.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJUdKngEp78jkFdTQNd3TC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LTV-3000 Pro is just as massive as some of the other 4K UST projectors I tested, and it delivers all the features you need in a stylish package. My only quibble is the choice of color; the projector is available in black, and the glossy plastic that&apos;s used on the sides is a dust magnet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6Q3dzoFUbxf3pjsAvPKAmJ" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-15.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Q3dzoFUbxf3pjsAvPKAmJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there are no issues with the design. There are large vents on the sides to deliver airflow into the chassis, with the vent on the right serving as the intake and the one on the left the exhaust. There&apos;s a power button up top, and you get AWOL Vision branding along with the usual Dolby labels, and a Tri-Chroma Laser moniker on one side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R8ykdXzVSQp3D4pt2auWwC" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-22.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R8ykdXzVSQp3D4pt2auWwC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The four rubber feet at the bottom make it easy to position the projector, and you can make any necessary adjustments to elevation. The projection lens sits in an island, and it has a larger outlet than some of its rivals, with AWOL Vision noting that it delivers better clarity even at a 150-inch projection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dkFnJaQuJd4sMjtjJ9pfnG" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-20.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkFnJaQuJd4sMjtjJ9pfnG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s the usual proximity sensor that switches off the laser when it detects an object, and I found that it was a tad too sensitive — it would switch off the screen even when I was walking by the projector. Overall, the LTV-3000 Pro certainly looks the part of a high-end UST projector, and the bold design combined with the build quality make it a great choice in this category.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-features"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qSBydbxy5ZF2txYzBApZvB" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-1.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qSBydbxy5ZF2txYzBApZvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LTV-3000 Pro isn&apos;t lacking when it comes to features; the UST projector is able to deliver a projection of up to 150 inches, and it uses a Texas Instruments 0.47 Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) along with a custom Ricoh lens to deliver a 4K projection with a contrast of 2500:1.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6GzF4ZTtMsUxXVJgfhxW8D" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-19.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6GzF4ZTtMsUxXVJgfhxW8D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the Tri-Chroma Laser branding suggests, it uses a three-laser light source that goes up to 3,000 lumens of brightness, and AWOL Vision touts a longevity of 25,000 hours for the laser, which is significantly more than what you get with traditional projectors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cyCdRpRYcP9c27CN8B3iNJ" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-13.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cyCdRpRYcP9c27CN8B3iNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of connectivity, the LTV-3000 Pro has Wi-Fi ac and Bluetooth 5.0, and you get three HDMI 2.0 ports at the back (one with eARC), two USB 2.0 ports that let you connect an external drive to the projector, digital audio out, and Ethernet. As for the hardware, you get 3GB of RAM and 128GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>There&apos;s 8-point keystone correction, and like other UST projectors, the LTV-3000 Pro has a standby mode where it consumes just 0.5W of power.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-picture-quality-and-sound"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Picture quality and sound</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3LEkYA3fCoMszCMQu4Wb5J" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-27.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LEkYA3fCoMszCMQu4Wb5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest selling point of the LTV-3000 Pro is that it is able to deliver an image that goes up to 3,000 lumens. That&apos;s significantly higher than the 1,800-lumen that the XGIMI Aura manages, and having used that projector for the better part of two years, there was an immediate difference when switching over to the LTV-3000 Pro.</p>
<p>Most UST projectors don&apos;t get as bright, and that doesn&apos;t make them as versatile as TVs; you&apos;ll mostly need to position them in a dark room with the blinds closed. But this is not an issue with the LTV-3000 Pro, and even with plenty of ambient light in the room, the projector was able to deliver a bright image that&apos;s more than serviceable. Heck, this UST projector gets brighter than most regular laser projectors, and that&apos;s no small feat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9FyZqyBzWmgrTPLcHr5DLG" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-28.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FyZqyBzWmgrTPLcHr5DLG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The projector has six modes — Standard, Vivid, Movie, Sport, Game, and User — and in my usage, I found the Movie mode to have the best color rendition. Both SDR and HDR content was rendered with plenty of detail and color vibrancy, and AWOL Vision did a great job calibrating the colors out of the box. What I also like is the sheer customizability on offer; you can easily change the white balance, contrast, saturation, and tweak the color balance as needed (in User mode).</p><p>I streamed a lot of content on the LTV-3000 Pro in the three months I used the projector, and I had zero issues with picture quality. Color balance and black levels are terrific throughout, and it does a far sight better than any other UST projector I tested thus far, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/vava-chroma-4k-laser-ultra-short-throw-projector-review">VAVA Chroma</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6XoamSQSx3KqzLtez9cm7G" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-26.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6XoamSQSx3KqzLtez9cm7G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The projector does a terrific job with HDR content, and it played Netflix&apos;s Dolby Vision titles without breaking a sweat. It is just as enjoyable for watching movies as well as sports, and its biggest differentiator is the high brightness levels. What&apos;s particularly great is that you get a 24fps option, and at the other end of the scale, there&apos;s MEMC.</p>
<p>You can also use the projector for gaming, and the dedicated Game mode lowers the latency down to 15ms. It doesn&apos;t manage 4K at 120Hz, but if you&apos;re looking to connect a console to a large screen, the LTV-3000 Pro is a great option. You can get 120Hz in 1080p, and the latency is as low as 8ms in this mode.</p>
<p>I set up the LTV-3000 Pro to deliver a 95-inch projection, but it goes up to 150 inches, using a throw ratio of 0.25:1. . The projector has two built-in audio drives that deliver 36W of sound, and it does a decent enough job in its own right. That said, you&apos;ll ideally need to pair it with a good soundbar.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-remote"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Remote</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AZDTmGbEDRrYw7b5FkdJcD" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-8.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZDTmGbEDRrYw7b5FkdJcD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design of the LTV-3000 Pro is clearly futuristic, the same cannot be said of the remote. It looks a bit chintzy and something out of the &apos;90s, and it doesn&apos;t have any similarities to the projector itself. The silver design looks gaudy, and it has too many buttons that are of little to no use.</p><p>The biggest issue is that there&apos;s no backlight, and that makes using the remote more cumbersome than it needs to be. The only good thing about it is that you won&apos;t have to use it after setting up the projector to your preferences.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-software"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HPH6x9CiZRAqqH2p7DtRqE" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-5.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPH6x9CiZRAqqH2p7DtRqE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AWOL Vision has a barebones software interface based on Android 9.0, and it doesn&apos;t offer any smarts; there&apos;s no way to install the usual set of streaming services, or do much with the UI at all. Other than switching HDMI sources and changing the projector&apos;s settings, you don&apos;t get many features.</p><p>Thankfully, AWOL Vision offloaded the software problem by bundling Amazon&apos;s streaming stick with the package. Most Chinese brands miss out on Netflix certification on their projectors — this is a constant bugbear on XGIMI&apos;s products — so by just bundling a streaming stick in the box, AWOL Vision doesn&apos;t have to worry about any of that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2pkC2oDvsCqbsdfsFeqRcC" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-7.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2pkC2oDvsCqbsdfsFeqRcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As such, there isn&apos;t much to talk about on the software front. There is a provision at the back of the projector to house the streaming stick — and power it natively — and it is a decent workaround to setting up a custom software interface or go with Android TV and worry about Netflix certification.</p><p>I used the LTV-3000 Pro with my go-to streaming device, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-pro-vs-standard">NVIDIA&apos;s Shield TV Pro</a>, and it turned out to be a terrific combination. The Shield TV Pro is incredibly fluid in daily use, has plenty of customizability, and lets me download all the streaming services I care about.</p>

<p>The XGIMI Aura shares a lot of similarities with the LTV-3000 Pro; it also uses a similar laser light source and delivers terrific colors out of the box. It doesn&apos;t get as bright as the LTV-3000 Pro, but it is more than adequate if you don&apos;t have too much ambient light. And at $1,699, it is much more affordable.</p>

<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want Android TV out of the box</li></ul>
<p>Honestly, AWOL Vision ticked all the right boxes with the LTV-3000 Pro. The projector is the brightest I tested yet, and it does a terrific job even if you have a lot of ambient light coming through. You get excellent colors and contrast levels, and there&apos;s enough customizability that you can tweak the color balance to your preferences.</p><p>The LTV-3000 Pro does a standout job with HDR content and Dolby Vision in particular, and the various modes make a difference in daily use; this is a versatile projector that can be used in a variety of settings. A big drawback with most new entrants in this segment is the software, and that&apos;s not an issue here. The only downside is the remote, but other than that, I don&apos;t have anything to fault with the LTV-3000 Pro.</p><p>It is costlier than its rivals, but if you want a bright projection with Dolby Vision and a decent amount of customizability, the LTV-3000 Pro is a standout choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>This week, Google agreed to clear a trove of browsing data in an attempt to settle the infamous Incognito mode lawsuit, which was first brought to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tracking-private-incognito-browsing-lawsuit-proceeding">light in 2020</a>, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-pledges-to-destroy-browsing-data-to-settle-incognito-lawsuit-1febfde5">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>The lawsuit alleged that Google Chrome was tracking its users&apos; browsing data even while in &apos;incognito&apos; mode, which allows users to browse without saving their browsing history. It also claims that the tech giant was not upfront about its data policies and misled its customers.</p><p>Earlier in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-incognito-mode-update">January</a>, Google admitted that it tracks users while in Incognito mode, even if Chrome doesn&apos;t save their browsing data. Even though it clearly states each time you open a new Incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session.</p><p>According to the publication, the settlement details were filed at the San Francisco federal court, stating that the company will now work on changing its policies around private browsing. </p><p>Additionally, Google has agreed to destroy billions of data points that the lawsuit alleges were improperly collected, to update disclosures on its website stating the corrected policies on private browsing, and also to give Chrome users the ability to turn off third-party cookies.</p><p>"At a high level, we made several important changes to our disclosures to provide clarification on how your data is collected and how visible your activities are when you visit a website using Incognito Mode," a Google spokesperson stated.</p><p>The lawsuit alleged that Google violated federal wiretapping laws through this discrepancy. As compensation, the plaintiffs asked for a minimum of $5 billion, although Google confirmed to Android Central that it would not pay these damages. Nonetheless, Boies notes that the settlement represents "a historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies." Boies said.</p><p>WSJ states that the agreement still needs final approval from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the Northern District of California.</p><p>Android Central contacted Google about this settlement, and a spokesperson said that they were pleased to settle this lawsuit, which they always believed was meritless. </p><p>"We never associate data with users when they use Incognito mode. We are happy to delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalization," Castañeda added.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 may introduce a significant overhaul for the volume control panel, enhancing both its appearance and functionality.</li><li>The latest developer preview showcases a redesigned volume panel with prominent pill-shaped sliders, visual indicators for volume levels, and streamlined functionality for muting streams.</li><li>Animated adjustments to the text on the sliders add a visually appealing touch to the volume control interface.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been tweaking Android&apos;s Material You design across different parts of the interface. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> coming up, the search giant might introduce a big makeover for the volume control panel, both in looks and functionality.</p><p>The old volume panel definitely needs a facelift. Currently, it has five skinny sliders for media, calls, rings, notifications, and alarms, plus buttons to dive into the sound settings or just get rid of the panel altogether. And if there&apos;s something playing, you also get a switcher to change where the sound comes out.</p><p>It&apos;s handy, no doubt, but it&apos;s been pretty much the same over the past few years. According to Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-volume-panel-3429806/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the volume panel in Android 15 might finally get a new look and some extra tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>A few screenshots from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">Android 15 Developer Preview 2 release</a> show off a fresh volume panel with big, pill-shaped sliders. Plus, there&apos;s a noticeable dot showing the maximum volume, and you can quickly mute a stream by tapping its icon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.50%;"><img id="6KasKPGZA9hahmgBFFxhV" name="android-15-redesigned-volume-control-panel.jpg" alt="redesigned volume control panel in Android 15 with pill-shaped sliders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KasKPGZA9hahmgBFFxhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="535" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 15 DP2 also ditched the "Sound & vibration" header from the panel. Instead, it shows a media output switcher that stays put. Rahman points out that this is different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, where you&apos;d only see the output switcher below the media volume slider if there was something playing in the background.</p><p>Android Authority posted a video showing neat animations for these new sliders. As you adjust the volume, the text on those pill-shaped sliders adjusts too, making sure you always see what you&apos;re adjusting.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QXmFa4_qElE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Besides those changes, the new design also lets you shrink it down or hide it altogether using an arrow next to the media volume slider. Rahman mentions that if there&apos;s media playing, you&apos;ll only see the media slider, but when there&apos;s nothing playing, all five controls will pop up.</p><p>Rahman also mentions spotting some cool features like "noise control" and spatial audio in this revamped volume panel, but he couldn&apos;t quite get them up and running. We&apos;ll likely get a better picture of what to expect from Android 15 when the first beta starts to roll out.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is that time of month when OnePlus 12 users should check their device’s settings for OTA updates, as the company announced a new update with the latest security patch.</p><p>After rolling out the <strong>OxygenOS 14.0.0.602</strong> early last month, the company is now rolling out the <strong>14.0.0.604</strong> version for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> devices across the Indian, North American, and Global regions, OnePlus shared in its accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1561728837002199044">community post</a> over the weekend.</p><p>The new firmware released across regions brings the latest March 2024 Android security patch, and the shared changelog notably has system-wide improvements and fixes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MvDgjEB7kRQTTCxCkZ7quD" name="OnePlus-12R-Genshin-Impact-edition-02.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12R Genshin Impact Edition at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MvDgjEB7kRQTTCxCkZ7quD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest update allows users to “create photo collages without frames in Photos.” A new “Partial screenshot” option has been added to the Smart Sidebar in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-android-14-hands-on">OxygenOS 14</a> release.</p><p>The update also brings convenience for the OnePlus 12 users, who can now turn on the flashlight without waking up the screen by simply long-pressing the volume down rocker.</p><p>The interface also has other nifty features, such as typing the first letter of an app in the home screen search bar, which gives you way better results in Drawer mode. </p>
<p>Additionally, users won&apos;t have to tamper with the real volume settings since they can modify the volumes at "app-specific" levels. For instance, users may reduce the volume on the Instagram app individually while maintaining the current system volume settings.</p><p>The update also notably improved “the volume bar’s design for ease of use and visual consistency.” Lastly, alongside the security patch, users can expect system-wide stability enhancements with the new incremental release of OxygenOS 14.</p><p>OnePlus says that the new update has begun rolling out to the OnePlus 12 in the aforementioned regions in batches, meaning only a small percentage of users have started getting it over the weekend, and a broader rollout will presumably follow in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>OnePlus is further encouraging its users to submit bugs and feedback to the community, which may be addressed in the following update.</p>

Of course, you also need a good device to take advantage of those plans, which is why you can either via a new smartphone through Big Red or bring over your existing unlocked smartphone. That said, we suggest signing up for Verizon phone insurance too, especially if you have a top-tier flagship device. Sure, it will increase your monthly expenses a little, but your smartphone will stay protected against theft, accidental damage, and much more.</p><p>The carrier offers a bunch of services under the &apos;Verizon Mobile Protect&apos; brand, and these include everything from screen repairs to tech support. Here&apos;s everything you need to know about Verizon&apos;s phone insurance.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-it"><span>What is it?</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-is-verizon-phone-insurance-2">What is Verizon phone insurance?</h2>
<p>Verizon offers quite a few insurance options for customers who want to have their smartphones insured. These services include protection against theft and damage, as well as device repairs, tech support, device optimization, and much more. These are primarily divided into the following three sub-categories:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Wireless Phone Protection:</strong> This covers loss, theft, and damage (screen and liquid), and you get unlimited cracked screen repairs for selected smartphones.</li><li><strong>Verizon Extended Warranty:</strong> This lets you avail unlimited out-of-warranty repairs for selected smartphones by appointment, at a Verizon-authorized repair facility.</li><li><strong>Mobile Secure:</strong> This involves 24x7 tech support (via 'Tech Coach' app), data recovery, and other optimization services. </li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC" name="verizon-warehouse-logo.jpg" alt="Verizon logo in warehouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth noting that Verizon Mobile Protect bundles all three of the above-detailed services. However, you can also choose to get them separately, provided your device is eligible. These protection plans very slightly differ for customers in New York, and Verizon Extended Warranty isn&apos;t available for customers in Florida.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-who-can-enroll"><span>Who can enroll?</span></h3>
<h2 id="who-can-enroll-in-verizon-phone-insurance-2">Who can enroll in Verizon phone insurance?</h2>
<p>In order to benefit from Verizon phone insurance, you must enroll within 30 days of activating your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones" target="_blank">new/upgraded device (purchased through the carrier)</a> on a new or existing line. If you&apos;re bringing over an unlocked device to use on Verizon&apos;s network, the device must be fully functioning and free of any defects. Furthermore, it should not be lost or stolen, and must be activated on a new line.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-do-verizon-apos-s-phone-insurance-plans-cost-2">How much do Verizon&apos;s phone insurance plans cost?</h2>
<p>If you sign up for the full Verizon Mobile Protect plan, you&apos;ll have to pay $14 or $17 per month, depending on the type of smartphone. If you need multi-device coverage on multiple lines, you&apos;ll have to pay a monthly cost of $34, $50, or $60, depending on the number of lines.</p><p>Regardless of the number of lines you register for, you can file an unlimited number of claims. You aren&apos;t charged any deductible for cracked screen repairs, but for any other damage that&apos;s ineligible for cracked screen repair, a $99 deductible will apply. This deductible won&apos;t be applicable if your loss and theft deductible is under $99. In that case, the amount charged will be the same as your loss and theft deductible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1246px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="jGNpMFZeHRj4ZVcQVmBcRd" name="verizon mobile protect pricing.jpg" alt="verizon mobile protect pricing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGNpMFZeHRj4ZVcQVmBcRd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1246" height="700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Verizon)</span></figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="is-phone-insurance-really-worth-it-2">Is phone insurance really worth it?</h2>
<p>Phone insurance might seem like an unnecessary additional expense, but with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> costing thousands of dollars, it actually makes a lot of sense. Sure, you can be extra careful while using your expensive new smartphone and even get a bunch of accessories like cases and screen protectors to keep it safe and secure, but with Verizon phone insurance, you&apos;ll get complete peace of mind.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1128px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="AAdHAkj7KKmmSJJ3rMVDqJ" name="verizon and asurion phone repair.jpg" alt="verizon and asurion phone repair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAdHAkj7KKmmSJJ3rMVDqJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1128" height="635" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Verizon / Asurion)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the best thing about phone insurance is that it not only keeps your device protected against accidental damage, but also theft and loss. Moreover, the extra amount you pay every month will gives you access to a broad array of benefits like data recovery, 24x7 tech support, unlimited cracked screen repairs, and a lot more. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-verizon-everything-you-need-know" target="_blank">Verizon&apos;s 5G</a> network getting better and better, you&apos;ll most likely need a high-end smartphone (e.g., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>) to have the best experience, so it&apos;s a great idea to get one of the carrier&apos;s insurance plans to along with it as well.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-smart-tv-2">What should I look for in a smart TV?</h2>
<p>When you&apos;re shopping for smart TVs, you&apos;ll immediately notice that manufacturers throw a bunch of impressive-sounding jargon in your face to make their models seem more appealing. Some of this information is <em>actually </em>important, while other details are just filling space. To cut through the noise, we&apos;ve gathered a few of the most important things to worry about when making your final decision. </p>
<ul><li><strong>1. Resolution: </strong>Although TVs with 8K resolution are starting to be released, they're quite expensive, and most TV shows and films aren't made to support that resolution anyway. For now, you can save some money and have a nearly-identical experience by going with a 4K TV. If you want all of your favorite shows and films to look as good as possible, look for a set with 4K upscaling.  </li><li><strong>2. Refresh rate:</strong> To put it simply, a TV's refresh rate will affect how smooth and lifelike moving images appear on your display, whether you're watching live sports or playing video games. 60Hz is generally fine for smaller TVs, but 120Hz is even better, especially if your TV is larger than 60 inches. Some TVs may even come with a game optimization mode that boosts the refresh rate up to 240Hz. </li><li><strong>3. OLED vs. LCD: </strong>Despite all of the many proprietary varieties touted by manufacturers (QLED, ULED, etc), all you need to know is that smart TVs are broken down into two categories: LCD and OLED. LCD technology is generally found in more-affordable TVs and looks pretty great most of the time. If you can afford it, however, OLED makes a big difference in larger TVs, with consistently richer colors and better contrast. Technologies such as Samsung's "QLED" and Hisense's "ULED" are basically just marketing terms used to describe the companies' proprietary takes on LCD. Rule of thumb: if you have over $1,000 to spend on a TV, go OLED; otherwise, an LCD with 4K support should be just fine. </li><li><strong>4. Price: </strong>Smart TVs are some of the only pieces of tech that haven't gotten more expensive in recent years. Depending on the size you need, you could probably get away with spending $500 or less on a great 4K TV for your home. Don't be fooled by all of the high-tech jargon: as long as the reviews seem consistent and the TV comes with 4K resolution, a refresh rate over 60Hz, and three or four HDMI ports, you should be all set. </li></ul>
<h2 id="what-size-smart-tv-should-i-get-2">What size smart TV should I get?</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re trying to figure out which size TV you should buy, the first thing to know is that the size of a TV is determined by measuring one corner of the screen to another. Take a tape measure and hold it "corner to corner" in the space you&apos;re hoping to place your new smart TV and consider how far away you&apos;ll be sitting from the screen. For example, if you&apos;re sitting around six feet away from your TV screen, a 50-inch to 70-inch TV should be sufficient. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for something different from the usual, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra stands out among the pack. It has AI features to rival other brands, though some are still in beta. It offers support for hi-res music, fast refresh rate for gaming and entertainment, and solid specs, overall. But it’s more of a short-term phone given the limited software and security update support.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is about as premium an Android device as you can get. It has lots of AI features, being among one of the first Android devices to incorporate many of them. It’s a stunning, durable, and high-quality phone with impressive specs. But it’s also one of the more expensive Android devices. With that said, it will be supported by software and security updates for a long, long time.</p></p>

<p>If AI is on the mind, two phones that really focus on incorporating AI features are the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. These are two very different phones, however, when it comes to price point. Naturally, Galaxy devices have a reputation for being among the most popular and respected Android phones around. How does the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra stack up? Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is the newer phone of the two, introduced in March 2024. Each has black sides with Skyline Blue, Eternal Black, Misty Grey, or Desert Sand on the back. The screen is a 6.78-inch flexible E6 AMOLED display that boasts a 2,400 x 1,080-pixel resolution and is protected by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>. Employing a glossy matte finish with the Chinese symbol for “people” on it, the phone is both durable and elegant. It also meets IP68 certification for water and dust resistance. </p><p>The screen is ultra-bright, so you can comfortably view it in any setting, including bright sunlight, thanks to 1,600 nits brightness and 2,500 nits peak brightness. To keep up with all types of tasks, from basic e-mails to intense gaming sessions, the screen refresh rate can flip from 1-120Hz as needed. There is a boost option to go up to 144Hz as well, but Android Central’s Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">says in his Zenfone 11 Ultra review</a> that it only works with a limited selection of games and can’t be manually turned on. </p><p>A smidge shorter and lighter than the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is described by Jonnalagadda as being tall and heavy, but he adds that the weight distribution is balanced wonderfully, so it’s not uncomfortable to hold. The phone comes with 256GB or 512GB storage, and it does not have a microSD card slot. </p><p>Running on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with the ZenUI overlay, Jonnalagadda loves the customizability offered by ZenUI and says it’s fluid and nice looking. However, he did note that he was experiencing some issues with push notifications. The one major strike against this phone is the fact that it only comes with two major software updates and four years of security updates, which is far less than most premium phones nowadays, including the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. </p><p>Equipped with an impressive 5,500mAh battery, you can be confident that the phone will last all day, and potentially even beyond. It also supports 65W HyperCharge fast charging along with wireless charging. </p><p>Along with dual stereo speakers that Jonnalagadda says are among the “loudest in this category,” the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra also has dual mics with ASUS Noise Reduction technology, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, and dual SIMs. Operating on the 5G network, there’s also a fingerprint sensor and face unlock options. One stand-out feature is that this phone has a 3.5mm input for connecting wired headphones, which is something a lot of other phone manufacturers are doing away with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nzWWocqmTAkz7iYBZByzoX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-display-sunlight-01.jpg" alt="The vibrant display of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzWWocqmTAkz7iYBZByzoX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> comes in Titanium Gray, Black, Violet, or Yellow, as well as Samsung exclusive colors Titanium Green, Blue, and Orange. As the name implies, it has a durable titanium frame with Corning Gorilla Armor that further improves durability, scratch resistance, and reduces glare. It has a more premium look and feel, and it’s more durable overall, including meeting the IP68 specification as well. </p><p>With a tad larger 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X QHD+ screen, it’s also higher resolution at 3,088 x 1,440. The 2,600 nits peak brightness means you’ll have no trouble viewing the phone outdoors in bright sunlight. This is further solidified with Samsung’s Vision Booster technology. The same adaptive 120Hz refresh rate ensures the phone runs smoothly whether you’re posting to social media or playing a graphics-heavy game. </p><p>There’s an additional 1TB option along with 256GB and 512GB, but like the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, this is not expandable. It, too, runs on Android 14 alongside Samsung’s One UI 6.1 overlay, so you can enjoy additional customization options with this phone as well. One feature that makes this phone stand out is the inclusion of a Samsung S Pen, which is ideal for sketching, taking notes, and seamlessly navigating without having to use your finger or thumb. The real stand-out here, however, is that Samsung supports the phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">seven years of both software and security updates</a>, so you can rest assured that it will be “current” for many years to come. </p><p>The battery is not as big at 5,000mAh, but it <em>does</em> support fast wireless charging 2.0 via the WPC standard, so you’ll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-series-chargers">need a specific type of charger</a> with a 45W adapter and 5A USB-C cable. It also works with Wireless PowerShare, so the phone can be used to recharge other compatible devices when placed atop its surface, like other Galaxy phones, Galaxy Buds, and more. </p><p>Additional features include dual stereo speakers, 5G, Wi-Fi Direct, and Bluetooth 5.3, but there’s no headphone jack.</p>

<p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor and 12 or 16GB RAM, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is a pretty powerful device. It also comes with lots of AI features, though many are still in beta mode at the time of this writing. AI translator, for example, can translate your words into text and/or voice for the person on the other end of the call and vice versa. AI transcript transcribes phone calls in real-time, while AI wallpaper creates a personalized image for you based on the styles you love.   </p><p>Along with AI noise cancellation, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra also has dual stereo speakers and supports lossless, Hi-Res audio up to 384kHz/32-bit with compatible wired headphones. With Dirac Virtuo for Headphone spatial sound and aptX audio codecs support, you can further enjoy an immersive personal listening experience. Along with listening to music, Jonnalagadda says this feature makes a difference when watching streaming content and playing games. </p><p>The ASUS GlideX feature makes it easy to mirror your phone and share videos and photos across other devices, using the phone as a webcam and creating an improved desktop set-up. There’s also a feature called Phone Link that makes it possible to sync the phone with a laptop or PC and easily transfer files, take calls, and manage everyday productivity tasks. </p><p>There are features for gamers as well, including a game turbo engine that Jonnalagadda calls the best he has used on any phone. To ensure you have an uninterrupted video gaming experience, the Video Genie feature mutes calls and notifications until you’re done your playing session. One thing to note is that Jonnalagadda did notice some overheating after long gaming sessions.</p>

<p>Powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra offers 12GB RAM and a host of AI features as well. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-galaxy-s24-live-translate">Live Translate</a> offers real-time, two-way voice and text translation, and an interpreter feature displays live conversations on a split screen, both with and without an active connection. </p><p>With AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist</a>, get help composing text messages.

Transcript Assist also uses AI to help transcribe recordings, even summarize them. </p><p>One of the coolest AI features is Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which allows you to circle, highlight, scribble on, or tap an image on the screen to learn more about it. You’ll get contextual results right on the same screen without having to open a web browser separately. Depending on the type of content, you may also see additional overviews powered by AI that can tell you more about everything from a cultural dish to a plant or a piece of clothing or be able to ask further questions using natural language queries. </p><p>The phone has features for gamers as well, including a larger vapor chamber designed to improve thermal control to prevent the phone from overheating. For security, enjoy Samsung Knox, Advanced Intelligence settings for disabling AI features if preferred, secure Wi-Fi, and more. </p><p>Both these phones are powerful and offer plenty of AI goodies, though Samsung’s AI features are fully available now while the ASUS ones are still in beta mode. But the features work similarly, allowing you to get the most out of your phone.</p>
<h2 id="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-taking-photos-2">ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Taking photos</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-12.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHZrVqa22NjNbzthwvJnwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nowadays, everyone takes photos with their smartphone, so ensuring the one you choose has decent camera is crucial.</p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra has a 50MP main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide camera, a 32MP telephoto camera with a 3x lens, and a 32MP front camera. After his tests, Jonnalagadda says photos had great detail both during the day and night, offering great dynamic range and color accuracy. In low-light scenarios, he did notice some fringing and a slight loss of detail. In comparison to older-model Zenfone models, however, he says this camera is the best yet. </p><p>The camera has some of the typical features you’d expect from a phone camera, including portrait mode, along with unique ones as well. The portrait video mode, for example, uses AI to provide a depth-of-field effect, and can recognize the faces of both people and pets. The Super Hyper Steady EIS algorithm works in tandem with other features to ensure smooth photos and photos. </p><p>Other camera features include 10x zoom with HyperClarity AI algorithm and direct processing of RAW files. AI Object Sense recognizes objects and optimizes them, and semantic search lets you locate photos in your albums based on specific parameters, like event, time, location, or object, using AI assistance.  </p>

<p>The decision between the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra might seem like a tough one. With the same processor, the option for more RAM, same refresh rate, wireless charging, larger battery, same durable design, and more, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is very tempting, especially considering it costs much less. But there’s more to it than that. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is indeed a phone you’ll love using, and it will enable you to keep up with everything you want to do, from productivity to entertainment, casual gaming, experimenting with AI, snapping photos, and staying in touch. But the big deciding factor will be longevity. </p><p>With Samsung supporting the Galaxy S24 Ultra for seven years of OS and security updates, it’s more than three times as long as ASUS offers for the Zenfone 11 Ultra. This becomes moot if you plan to trade in or upgrade your phone in a few years anyway. For those who finance their phones and will be handing them back in after the contract period to get something new, this won’t matter. If you are buying the phone outright, however, you will get better value with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. </p><p>Not only will you be able to hold onto the phone for 5+ years and still be able to enjoy the most up-to-date features (that the phone itself supports), but you’ll get more money for it if you are trading it in or reselling it. So, while you’re spending more, you’re getting something that’s built to last in more ways than one. </p><p>There are other aspects to consider. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a much higher resolution screen, better cameras, and Wireless PowerShare, which is valuable if you have other Samsung products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Samsung Buds</a> and comes in funky colors. When considering overall value, you’ll get more from the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. But if you plan to sign up for a contract and trade in the phone for a new one in two years, you can save a bit by considering the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, and it will beautifully meet your needs.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rumors suggest Samsung is working on a new foldable phone model, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra, with upgrades, but its availability in global markets remains uncertain.</li><li>Samsung appears to be preparing only one variant of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra (SM-F958N) specifically for South Korea.</li><li>Limited information suggests the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra may not have variants for other markets, potentially restricting its availability.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier rumors hinted that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-second-model-rumor">might be bringing out a new foldable phone model called the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra</a>, with a few upgrades. Now, a fresh report claims to provide more evidence that this model is real, but that it might not hit every market.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra/" target="_blank">Galaxy Club</a>, the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will go by the model number SM-F956, while its souped-up sibling, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra, will be tagged as SM-F958 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-real-limited-release/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>The report pointed out a trend where "6" typically represents a regular Fold model and "8" stands for Ultra models in recent releases. For instance, the current Galaxy Z Fold 5 is SM-F946, while the upcoming Fold is likely to be SM-F956. Furthermore, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> carries the model number SM-S928.</p><p>Adding to the mix, there&apos;s a recent leak from the well-known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1762764063124144585" target="_blank">Max Jambor</a>, who dropped some hints about three model designations linked to the Z series. For instance, Samsung apparently designated the Galaxy Z Fold 6 as "Q6" and the Z Flip 6 as "B6."</p><p>However, there&apos;s a mysterious "Q6a" designation floating around, and we&apos;re scratching our heads trying to figure out what it might be referring to since no model with that label has surfaced yet.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung seems to be focusing on just one variant of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra, marked as SM-F958N. The "N" suggests it&apos;s tailored specifically for South Korea, leaving the rest of us out in the cold, assuming the ultra-premium model comes out.</p><p>As it stands, there&apos;s no information floating around about models or variants for other markets. Unless we start seeing more model numbers pop up, it seems like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra might just stay within Samsung&apos;s home turf for its release.</p><p>Introducing a pricier foldable might sound risky given the already steep prices of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phonehttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. But Samsung&apos;s been dominating the foldable game lately. So, throwing in a more robust model could actually be a smart move, spicing up the next generation of foldables and giving consumers more options.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google released Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2 about a month ago, addressing significant bugs, and now Beta 2.1 is out with numerous bug fixes.</li><li>The latest update, AP21.240305.005, including the March 2024 security patch, is available for various supported devices, ranging from the Pixel 5a to the latest Pixel models.</li><li>Notable issues in QPR3 Beta 2.1 include launcher crashes, charging problems, frozen apps, and navigation glitches, although it's not as severe as the initial Beta 2 release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s been about a month since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> QPR3 Beta 2 was released, and Google had to tackle some major bugs with that one. It looks like the search giant is still at it because today, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/release-notes" target="_blank">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a> with a ton of bug fixes.</p><p>Even though we&apos;re probably getting QPR3 Beta 3 in a couple of weeks, Google is starting off April with QPR3 Beta 2.1, which comes with another unexpectedly large batch of bug fixes, including the following:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused a device's launcher to crash when trying to view recent apps. (Issue #328803294)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented Pixel Tablet devices from charging while connected to the dock. (Issue #299800125)</li><li>Fixed an issue where swiping up from the bottom of the screen didn't always return to the home screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the layout of notifications on the lock screen to display with additional padding.</li><li>Fixed various issues that were causing frequent "Application not responding" errors for both system and user apps.</li><li>Fixed an issue where swiping down from the top of the screen didn't always show the notification shade.</li><li>Fixed an issue for Pixel Fold devices where sometimes when the device was unfolded, only half of the inner screen displayed content.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented a user's wallpaper settings from being backed up properly.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes stopped the "Quick Tap to start actions" gesture from working.</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, performance, connectivity, interactivity, and camera.</li></ul>
<p>The latest update (AP21.240305.005), including the March 2024 security patch, is now up for grabs on all supported devices: Pixel 5a, 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, 8, 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet.</p><p>A few standout issues to mention are launcher crashes, charging problems, frozen apps, navigation glitches, display issues, and a bunch more. It&apos;s not as bad as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2">mess we had with the original Beta 2 release last month</a>. Still, QPR3 is kind of iffy right now, so you might want to hold off on installing it on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android phone</a>.</p><p>We&apos;re still in the dark about whether Google has sorted out the OTA sideloading problem from last month, which caused some devices to end up being bricked until the files were pulled.</p><p>Google&apos;s stance remains the same, advising testers to just wait for the OTA update to come through; no sideloading is necessary.</p><p>If you&apos;re already part of the Android 14 Beta program, you&apos;ll get the QPR3 Beta 2.1 update automatically via an over-the-air (OTA) download.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s latest One UI 6.1 update for past-gen devices has seemingly returned a useful longevity feature for your display.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://toranji.ir/2024/03/30/%d8%a8%d8%a7%da%af-%d9%86%d9%85%d8%a7%db%8c%d8%b4%da%af%d8%b1-%d8%b3%d8%a7%d9%85%d8%b3%d9%88%d9%86%da%af-%d8%a8%d8%a7-%d8%a2%d9%be%d8%af%db%8c%d8%aa-one-ui-6-1-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%b7%d8%b1%d9%81-%d8%b4/">Toranji</a> (Persian), Samsung has returned its burn-in protection software for devices rocking an OLED display panel (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/01/samsung-one-ui-6-1-burn-in-protection-update/">9to5Google</a>). The company&apos;s burn-in protection involves a Galaxy device&apos;s status bar, which is typically relatively static. From the publication&apos;s testing, the status bar on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> shifts slightly to the right every few seconds to avoid burn-in.</p><p>Testing also showed that Galaxy phone&apos;s navigation bar elements shift to help preserve the display&apos;s quality.</p><p>Burn-in protection helps to ensure that users are left with lingering UI elements after the display is turned off or elements change. The publication notes that users first noticed a lack of burn-in protection on the device following Android 14 in November.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if the Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series picked up the return of burn-in protection. It would be odd if Samsung didn&apos;t re-enable it for those devices, considering they all boast an AMOLED display like the S23 series.</p>

<p>More importantly, Samsung has kept its promise that it would return the protection measure — albeit a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s23-january-2024-security-patch">little later than expected</a>. The company confirmed around the time of the S23&apos;s January security drop that it would return its burn-in protection. Samsung stated it would arrive with its "next update version," but testing shows its existence following the One UI 6.1 update.</p><p>The latest One UI update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">started rolling out</a> in the U.S. on March 28, bringing the brand&apos;s Galaxy AI software to past-gen devices. The Galaxy S23 series, Flip 5, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series were granted access to features like Google&apos;s "Circle to Search," Live Translate, online summaries, and more.</p><p>A few Generative Edit and Chat Assist features also slipped into the update.</p>
