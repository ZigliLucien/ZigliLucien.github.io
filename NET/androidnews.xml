                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>XR glasses are interesting as they essentially allow you to take a massive 200-inch screen anywhere. All you need to do is connect your phone, and you have a home theater on the go. There are a few brands that are catering to this niche, and TCL-backed RayNeo is a frontrunner on the back of products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/rayneo-air-2s-xr-smart-glasses-review">Air 2S</a>. <br><br>The Air 2S XR glasses have Sony micro-OLED that projects up to a 200-degree image, and it has 120Hz refresh, which actually makes a difference. But what I like the most about it is that it has a bright image, so even if you're outdoors, there are no issues in this area. The Air 2S usually costs $379, but it's now on sale for Cyber Monday, bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-2s-Glasses-Brightness-dp-B0D93R1RT3/dp/B0D93R1RT3">cost down to $279</a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need XR glasses that are well-suited for entertainment. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want XR glasses that don't have any fringing on the edges.</p>
<p>I also have the regular Air 2 glasses, and the main difference between those and the Air 2S is that the latter is lighter, and you get much better sound. You get quad audio drivers on the unit, and the sound quality is noticeably better. Otherwise, you get the same Sony micro-OLED panel on both glasses, and it has great color fidelity and brightness. <br><br>While they're aimed at streaming, I mostly use these glasses in conjunction with the Steam Deck; it's just great to be able to enlarge the screen of the handheld while sitting on the sofa and gaming, and the Air 2S is terrific in this area. I didn't have any issues with the fit either, and the only issue I noticed with these glasses is that there's fringing at the edges. It's not as evident as the Air 2, but it's still there, and you see it when moving your head around. <br><br>You also get a hard shell case, and it's essential to ensure these glasses stay protected on the go. Overall, the Air 2S glasses offer a unique way to stream entertainment on the go, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-2s-Glasses-Brightness-dp-B0D93R1RT3/dp/B0D93R1RT3">Cyber Monday deal</a> makes the product that much more affordable.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Waze incident alerts, like police presence warnings, are showing up on Google Maps, with a clear note that they came from Waze users.</li><li>Users can confirm or dismiss these alerts, which pop up briefly to keep the map clean.</li><li>The feature is still rolling out slowly, with only a few users noticing it, and its regional availability is unclear.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over ten years after buying Waze, Google has finally been blending the platform with its own navigation app, with the latest step being the addition of live Waze incident reports to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a>.</p><p>Back in July, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-making-your-commute-less-sucky-with-new-traffic-and-parking-helpers">revealed plans to simplify incident reporting</a> by merging insights from both Maps and Waze users. Around the same time, Waze announced plans to share its user reports directly with Maps. Now, with Waze incident reports officially live on Maps, that vision is becoming a reality.</p><p>A post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1h38vj1/google_maps_now_sharing_waze_user_reports/" target="_blank">Maps subreddit</a> recently highlighted Waze-sourced incident alerts, like heads-ups about nearby police presence, popping up on Maps (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/30/google-maps-waze-reports/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The alert also makes it clear that the report came from a Waze user.</p><p>The alert lets users confirm if law enforcement is still at the spot. You can say yes, no, or just dismiss it altogether.</p><p>The alert pops up briefly before disappearing, keeping the map clear for navigation. It’s still pretty under the radar since most Maps users haven’t seen it yet.</p><p>The update comes shortly after Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-easier-to-report-police-spottings-in-maps">revamped Maps' incident reporting</a>, changing "speed traps" to the broader "police," so it now covers all sorts of law enforcement activity on the roads.</p><p>Right now, the feature seems to be rolling out slowly, with just a few users—like the original Reddit poster and a commenter—spotting it. Its regional availability is still unclear too.</p><p>As 9to5Google puts it, bringing Google’s navigation apps together was a no-brainer. Sure, the incident reports might not always be spot-on, but those quick confirmation buttons make it easy for the community to keep things updated in real time.</p><p>Even though Google owns both, Maps and Waze have been running as separate apps. With both still thriving under Google after a decade, a full integration isn’t in the cards. But the recent addition of Waze incident reports to Maps shows there's more overlap happening between the two.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Cyber Monday has plenty of great phone deals, but it can be hard to pick one that suits your needs. That's where I come in — I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-tested-over-70-phones-in-2024-these-are-my-black-friday-picks">used over 70 phones</a> this year, and I have a good understanding of what each manufacturer is bringing to the table. I'm fortunate in that I don't need to buy phones (the last device I bought was the LG G4), but I routinely suggest phones to friends and family, and I'm cognizant of how much these devices cost now. <br><br>I analyzed all the phone deals available on Cyber Monday, and if I had to buy one with my own money, there's no doubt that I'd choose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. It isn't a recent phone, and the Tensor G4 platform powering the device isn't the fastest around, but as an overall device, the Pixel 8 Pro ticks all the right boxes — it has fantastic cameras at the back, clean software with no bloatware and useful AI features, a vibrant OLED panel, and battery that lasts all day. <br><br>But the biggest reason for recommending the phone is the sheer value; the Pixel 8 Pro is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto/dp/B0CGTJ12Z9">selling for just $592</a> as part of Google's Cyber Monday deals, and that's an unbelievable 41% discount from its usual selling price. Although there are better phones on sale, there isn't another device that gives you as many features as the Pixel 8 Pro in the sub-$600 category.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a phone with clean software, great cameras, and long-term software updates.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You play demanding games regularly on your phone.</p>
<p>I don't have much to fault with the Pixel 8 Pro; if anything, I like the design more than that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. It does a great job at the basics, and the cameras are outstanding at both photos and videos. It may not be quite on par with the Vivo X100 Pro or X100 Ultra, but there's no question that it measures up to any phone sold in North America. <br><br>The only annoyance is that it still has 128GB of storage on the base model, so you'll ideally need to invest in an external SSD to back up photos and videos once the storage gets full. What's interesting is that it will also get seven years of software updates, so it will continue to be relevant until 2030 — I can't say the same for any other phone in this category. <br><br>Ultimately, it's the clean software and great cameras that make me excited to use the Pixel 8 Pro, and the fact that it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto/dp/B0CGTJ12Z9">now down to $592</a> makes this the best Cyber Monday phone deal.</p>

<p>We're in the thick of the biggest sales event of the year as Black Friday merges into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday</a>, and we're swarmed with deals upon deals. We have plenty of deal hubs to help you all make informed decisions on the things we think you might want to buy, but they're also there to help <em>us</em> decide if there's anything worth spending our hard-earned money on. After all, who can ignore a good sale?</p><p>The Android Central staff took to some of the deals to purchase various items, and some of us actually purchased tech products, either for ourselves or for others. So here's a list of the things we bought in case you find something that might interest you.</p>

<p><strong>Sony ULT Field 1:</strong> I've been looking for a new portable Bluetooth speaker for some time since my UE Boom is so old that it just can't hold a charge anymore. I was tempted to get a new UE Boom 4, but the reviews deterred me, so I settled on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXKSCY1G">25% off Sony ULT Field 1 deal</a> (which you can read more about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-black-friday-cyber-monday-2024-deal">here</a>). From what I've read, including from our own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1 review</a>, the speaker is just what I need, with plenty of volume and bass, thanks to the ULT button. I'm excited to take this out on my upcoming New Year's get-together!</p>

<p><strong>SanDisk Extreme 2TB microSD Card</strong>: I'm of the mindset that there's no such thing as having too much storage, although I haven't reached <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-clocked-nearly-40-000-hours-on-this-nas-hdd-and-its-back-down-to-its-lowest-price" target="_blank">peak-Harish status</a> just yet. Even still, SanDisk JUST launched its first 2TB microSD card, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFX1XFFH/?">already on sale</a>. This is going to be perfect to store my emulation library so I can alternate between the different gaming handhelds I'm using at any given time.</p>

<p><strong>Sharge Shargeek 170:</strong> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sharge-shargeek-170-power-bank-review">Sharge 170</a> is unlike any other power bank I have, and the unique design is eye-catching. Distinctive design aside, the Sharge 170 delivers 140W via a single port, making it the ideal power bank to charge notebooks, and the 24,000mAh battery is travel-friendly while still having enough capacity to charge a notebook and two phones. It charges up to three devices at once, and unlike most power banks, the chassis has IP66 ingress protection. I used it throughout 2024 and liked it so much that I'm now buying a unit to give as a gift. Cyber Monday is the best time to do so as it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR9SPD1S" target="_blank">on sale for $135</a>, $52 less than its usual retail price.</p>

I've tried <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B092Q6KJ5D">Abanen hook and loop nylon bands</a> before, and I like how they make Garmin watches even lighter, but I'm excited to try this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQKF9RNP">EKINGEEK band</a> that looks a bit more rugged and secure than a traditional nylon band.

<p><strong>Google Pixel 9 at Mint Mobile: </strong>I decided to use Black Friday as an opportunity to upgrade my phone and finally ditch Verizon as my wireless carrier. It's sold out at the moment, but Mint Mobile caught my attention a few days ago by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-best-google-pixel-9-deal-of-black-friday-2024-isnt-at-amazon-or-best-buy-its-been-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-months">slashing $500 off the Pixel 9</a> during its Black Friday sale. That was good enough for me, but I realized that Mint was also pairing that discount with 50% off its Unlimited plan when I paid for a year in advance. So, for the price of a midrange phone, I basically got a full year of wireless and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, and now I don't have to think about my phone bill again for another 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>ANNAPRO head strap:</strong> This Black Friday, I picked up an ANNAPRO pressure-reducing head strap for my VR headset. While you may not have heard of ANNAPRO, the company specializes in creating supplemental head straps that combine with your VR headset's existing strap to add extra support, usually near your forehead. It can reduce facial pressure and make the headsets more comfortable to wear.</p><p>There's an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Vision-Pro-Pressure-Reducing-Compatible-Accessories/dp/B0D2222WSW/" target="_blank">ANNAPRO head strap for Apple Vision Pro</a> and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ANNAPRO-Battery-Compatible-Accessories-Playtime-PC/dp/B095BTW1K1/" target="_blank">ANNAPRO battery head strap for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S</a> — plus an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/A3-Max-Charging-Compatible-Accessories/dp/B0DGXJSLLD/" target="_blank">ANNAPRO A3 Max strap for the Quest 3 series</a> with a 10,800mAh battery and extra facial support. They're all about $10+ off their usual sticker price through Cyber Monday.</p>

But I'm reevaluating one watch I reviewed, the Amazfit Cheetah Pro, now that it's fallen to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review"><strong>$179 (40% off) for Cyber Monday</strong></a>, a much more reasonable price for what it offers.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Amazfit Cheetah Pro</a> hardware is (mostly) solid: the 1.45-inch AMOLED display, week-long battery life with heavy use, titanium bezel, mic/speaker for Bluetooth calls, dual-band GPS and altimeter for accurate location and elevation, and a lightweight 43g (with strap) frame all make for a compelling package!</p><p>The display could be brighter, the speaker louder, and the GPS and HR data slightly more accurate to match Garmin's. But the training software itself is solid: it gave me reliable post-run recovery time estimates and realistic training load numbers after my test workouts. My complaints are much easier to stomach at this price point, and anyone worried about optical HR accuracy can always connect an external HRM.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You don't want to pay for a fitness subscription for Zepp Coach AI insights, you need Bluetooth calling and voice commands on a non-smart watch, and you need guidance on what kind of workout to do to improve as a runner.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You can accept a cheaper-looking Garmin watch with no titanium bezel or downloadable local maps, but which will beat the Cheetah Pro for battery life and GPS accuracy while at least matching it for workout suggestions and training load insights.</p>
<p>I prefer Garmin watches, but only the $599 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> (currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner%C2%AE-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0BS1TP8TJ"><strong>$499 for Cyber Monday</strong></a>) has a titanium bezel and topographic maps, and you'd need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> (which doesn't have specialized running tools) for a mic & speaker. So, in theory, the Cheetah Pro was already a bargain at $299 and is now a steal at $179.</p><p>If you're more interested in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/early-black-friday-garmin-deals-2024-ditch-your-old-smartwatch-and-save-big-on-forerunner-venu-and-more">Garmin Cyber Monday deal</a> on a running watch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3VBDTV"><strong>$199 ($50 off)</strong></a>, making it only slightly more expensive than a Cheetah Pro. It has a smaller display, cheaper-looking design, only breadcrumb navigation, and no training load — but makes up for it with daily suggested workouts, recovery time, and better HR/ GPS accuracy. Still, you can see how Amazfit's ultra-discounted Cheetah Pro is a compelling alternative now!</p><p>You can also look into a proper smartwatch like the Pixel Watch 3 45mm LTE (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D91424WX"><strong>$170 off for Cyber Monday</strong></a>), which has much better Bluetooth calling, commands, Cardio Load, and AI smarts for workouts through Fitbit. But most runners would prefer the Cheetah Pro's 7-day battery life to the Watch 3's 2-day battery!</p><p>Even though I find the Zepp app and Cheetah Pro software a bit less polished than other brands, and I really wish its display got brighter in direct sunlight, the Amazfit Cheetah Pro is an all-around winner at this Cyber Monday price.</p>

<ul><li>Realme's next flagship could pack an extra-large battery ranging from 7,000mAh to 8,000mAh.</li><li>The current Realme GT 7 Pro features a 6,500mAh battery that's already much larger than most flagships, but Realme is shooting for an even bigger one next year.</li><li>According to leaker Digital Chat Station, there are three potential battery configurations being tested for Realme's next phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Realme might not be a household name in the US, but the brand is known for making Android smartphones with high-capacity batteries inside. The latest Realme GT 7 Pro packs a 6,500mAh battery inside, and even the sub-$400 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/realme-12-pro-plus-5g-review">Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G</a> includes a respectable 5,000mAh capacity. The phones charge fast, too, at 120W and 67W, respectively. As it turns out, Realme may be looking to improve on its own incredible high-capacity, fast-charging tech with its next flagship.</p><p>The company is reportedly testing three new variations of batteries, all with a larger capacity than the GT 7 Pro, according to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5106069766930600" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/realme-8000-mah-phone-3504525/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Per the tip, these are the characteristics of the three batteries being tested for Realme's upcoming flagship phone:</p>
<ul><li>A 7,000mAh battery supporting 120W fast charging that can be charged to full in 42 minutes</li><li>A 7,500mAh battery supporting 100W fast charging that can be charged to full in 55 minutes</li><li>An 8,000mAh battery supporting 80W fast charging that can be charged to full in 70 minutes</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7x5JVeAezUcHuS4LADBVGA" name="Realme-GT-6-review-18.jpg" alt="Realme GT 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7x5JVeAezUcHuS4LADBVGA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Realme has a few decisions to make for the battery that will power an upcoming flagship, which Digital Chat Station didn't name specifically. It could be the Realme GT 8 Pro, and the phone could debut in 2025. However, as the leaked configurations show, the company will almost certainly be choosing between capacity and charge speed.</p><p>Evidently, the 8,000mAh battery rumored to be in consideration for a to-be-released Realme flagship has slow charging, relatively speaking. It can only charge at 80W speeds, resulting in a 70-minute charge time from 0% to 100%. That might not be such a bad thing, though. There could be less of a need to charge to full with a phone sporting an 8,000mAh capacity, with an overnight charge doing the trick for a day-plus of use.</p><p>When you compare the worst charging speeds of Realme's purported battery options (80W, 70 min), they stack up quite nicely to the leading iPhone and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>, which still have atrocious charging speeds. It's clear that Realme would be padding its own lead in battery and charging tech if it released a smartphone with either 7,000mAh, 7,500 mAh, or 8,000mAh battery capacities.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you have an Android phone, foldable, or tablet you want to use like a console; you care about things like having a D-pad that can be pressed in eight different places, or microswitch buttons; you value ergonomics.</p><p><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need an ultra-portable game controller; you want a controller that supports haptic feedback on iOS and iPadOS; you don't want to spend more than $100.</p>
<p>The Razer Kishi Ultra might be the best controller you've ever used, not just the best <em>mobile</em> controller. This accessory features Razer's proprietary Mecha-tactile switches, which are tactile, clicky, and responsive, just like the ones you'd find on a high-end mechanical keyboard. While the joysticks aren't Hall effect, they are high-quality and come with sensitivity adjustment options in software. Speaking of software, the Razer Nexus app lets you tweak button mapping, change the controller's Razer Chroma RGB coloring, and use Razer Sensa HD Haptic feedback.</p><p>It's also the most versatile mobile game controller, supporting most Android devices running Android 12 or newer. The Razer Kishi Ultra also works with iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 devices, albeit without haptic support. With the a cable, you can use the Kishi Ultra with a gaming PC or laptop, too.</p><p>I'm a big fan of the Xbox Wireless Controller, and the Razer Kishi Ultra feels like that controller — but better, with mechanical switches. On top of that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, foldables, and small tablets can fit inside. If you want your phone to become a mobile gaming powerhouse, the Kishi Ultra is the accessory to buy, but you'll want to do so while it's discounted by $20 for Cyber Monday.</p>

<p>For anyone with a desk job, there's nothing more annoying than being reminded every hour how sedentary you're being. Apple and Galaxy Watches have Stand rings, while Fitbits or Pixel Watches tell you to walk 250 steps per hour. But most people I've asked say they turn off those reminders immediately.</p><p>Your first December pledge is simple: Turn those move alerts (back) on for the month. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">Sitting all day is extremely unhealthy</a>; that article links to several studies showing that sitting 8 hours <u>actively undoes the health benefits</u> of an hour-long workout the same day. So if you want to start working out to lose weight, you also need to stay active <em>outside</em> of workouts.</p><p>Taking just 1–2 minutes every hour to walk around your cube farm or do squats by your desk won't specifically lose weight — you need a sustained walk to actively burn calories — but I guarantee that staying limber will help prevent you from putting on <em>more</em> weight and get you ready for workouts later.</p><p>I specifically recommend a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> for move alerts, because they require you to move around for a specific 250-step goal, not just stand and wave your arms around. But an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch</a>'s ring-closing goals are also great motivation.</p>

<p>Speaking of steps, I'm sure you've all heard the cliche about walking 10,000 steps a day, which began as a marketing gimmick. But even though that number is arbitrary, the need for steps isn't. The medical consensus is that 6,000 steps a day will actively improve your health, with younger people requiring a higher daily average.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">I walked 10,000 steps a day for a month</a>, I lost seven pounds and 2.4% body fat, lowered my resting heart rate and blood pressure, and improved my cardiovascular fitness. I admittedly ran as well during this month, but the extra walking was the cause; case in point, I <em>gained</em> weight throughout 2023 despite running about 40–50 miles per month, up until that point.</p><p>For the next year, I continued to walk more frequently each month, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">helped me lose 30 pounds in 12 months</a> — weight that I've since kept off. Seriously, walking works. But it's also a subtle, long-term solution; don't expect it to have the same impact as some unhealthy crash diet.</p>

<p>It's harder to walk so much in winter when the days are short, so I'm not insisting you follow my lead exactly. Instead, look at your current average daily steps in your fitness app of choice, and pledge to add 2,000 steps, or 4,000 steps, or whatever number you can handle. Each extra mile will either counterbalance or subtract your weight gains from overeating, without being too difficult.</p><p>For me, it usually takes about 15 minutes to walk a mile, or 2,000 steps, at a brisk pace; I know in advance that 6,000 steps is about a 45-minute commitment. Figure out your average time, find a safe morning or evening walking route near home (or buy a treadmill), and commit to walking a mile+ more per day (as much as your schedule can handle) at least five days per week. Make it a group activity with family members, if you can.</p><p>Any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> should count steps more or less accurately, while a smart ring is accurate during walks but gives <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">lots of false positives</a> while you're sitting and typing. I prefer a Garmin watch, not only because they're extremely accurate for step count, but because they have step incentives. Every month has a 10,000-step "Challenge" to hit 300,000 for the month, helping you track your progress; plus, there is a weekly steps leaderboard where you compete with other random Garmin users to get the most steps that week.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M5Ert9szdXvsvLAd6CjAS3" name="Withings-Body-Smart-weight-test.jpeg" alt="A 15-pound scale sits on the Withings Body Smart.

<p>I'm not a dieting proponent. It's important to cut back on unhealthy foods and use portion control for your favorite snacks — like only one slice of pie at Thanksgiving — but everyone I know who counts calories tends to hyperfixate on feelings of hunger and devolve into binge-eating before too long.</p><p>That being said, calorie counting is the best way to determine if you're overeating and which foods are directly contributing to your weight gain. And I know other people who <strong>swear by</strong> apps like MyFitnessPal as a way to keep themselves honest and lose weight, so I'm including it here.</p><p>First, you need to figure out your body's basal metabolic rate (BMR), or the maintenance calories your body typically burns per day to sustain itself. You can use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html">online calculator</a>, or buy a smart scale like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/withings-body-smart-review">Withings Body Scale</a> that auto-calculates it based on every weigh-in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dRva4c5ZTMWcfRaRNC2J9K" name="myfitnesspal-wear-os-screenshots" alt="Screenshots of the MyFitnessPal Wear OS app, including protein/ fat summaries and adding calories to your daily total" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dRva4c5ZTMWcfRaRNC2J9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Logging and tracking calories in the MyFitnessPal Wear OS app </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MyFitnessPal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you know your baseline, your caloric goal is simple: If you cut your intake by 3,500 calories, you'll lose a pound. So you need to either decrease what you eat below your daily BMR to slowly add up the deficit to 3,500, or <em>increase</em> your daily maximum by working out (or walking).</p><p>Someone with a 2,000-calorie BMR can <em>try</em> eating 1,500 calories every day — which would hypothetically add up to four pounds of weight loss in a month — but you need to be realistic about what your mind and body can handle over a sustained period, especially with so many tempting opportunities to overeat in December. So set yourself a reasonable goal to (at the very least) break even by reducing bad calories, and raise your threshold with workouts and walking.</p><p>Available on both Apple Watches and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myfitnesspal.android&hl=en_US">MyFitnessPal</a> is the best smartwatch-based tool to keep track of this. It lets you log your most frequent meals, snacks, or drinks with a few taps, then see your daily carbs, fat, calories, or other bodily stats on a Tile view at any time, to make sure you're not overdoing it on sugar or slacking on your daily protein intake.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LtZcjgFBNMX3NLL2Dho7gB" name="google-pixel-9-fitbit-app-recommended-for-today.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 run coaching suggestion in the Fitbit app on a Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtZcjgFBNMX3NLL2Dho7gB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An AI-generated Fitbit workout for the Pixel Watch 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Walking is a safe, low-impact, and monotonous way to burn calories. If you want to really kick things into overdrive, you should start your couch-to-5K journey and start jogging more regularly. The problem is that most people who start running overdo it, hate the experience or injure themselves, and give up quickly.</p><p>That's why I recommend finding a watch that'll calculate your body's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>, or the ability to convert oxygen into energy effectively, and then give you recommendations for how much your body can work out on a given day.</p><p>More and more smartwatches now track your weekly or monthly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a>, then tell you if you're improving or worsening your fitness, or if you're overtraining. Apple, Pixel, Garmin, and even Amazfit have differing tools for judging when your HR rises above resting, creating a TL score based on how high and for how long, then judging how your TL effort compares to past days and weeks.</p><p>On top of that, some watches like the Pixel Watch 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> will use your training load data to generate automatic, daily run suggestions. Garmin gives you a specialized workout based on whether you need more low-HR or high-HR activities, with a specific time and pace. Fitbit generates a few different types of runs per day and has you stick to a particular <em>heart rate zone</em> instead, so it's less about results and more about individual effort.</p><p>If you're new to running, the Pixel Watch 3 is an excellent option; two other Android Central editors who aren't regular runners have told me that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Cardio Load and auto-generated workouts</a> make running more accessible to them. Otherwise, people looking to get seriously into running should look into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">Garmin Forerunner</a> series — especially since several of them are discounted for Cyber Monday right now!</p>

<p>In recent years, I&apos;ve grown kind of tired of the subpar experience offered by Amazon tablets. However, the Amazon Fire Max 11 remains in my rotation and is a sneaky Cyber Monday deal you shouldn&apos;t ignore. That&apos;s because you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6"><strong>save at least $90</strong></a>, if you want just the tablet, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW">up to $130</a> for one of the Fire Max 11 bundles.</p><p>Whenever I&apos;m asked about what Amazon tablet I would recommend, it&apos;s always the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a>. Although the Fire HD 8 has been improved, it just doesn&apos;t offer the same value that the Fire Max 11 provides. This is the same opinion I maintain even when it&apos;s not part of Amazon&apos;s Cyber Monday tablet deals.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4aaeeee0-d091-4544-b2bc-f5f626397170" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension48="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension25="$139.99" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kYNi2vcu7cdyeP6XFbBPuZ" name="Amazon Fire Max 11 render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kYNi2vcu7cdyeP6XFbBPuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="962" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>It can be tough navigating the sea of bad tablets on Cyber Monday, but the Amazon Fire Max 11 easily stands head and shoulders above the crowd. Not only can you save almost $100 on just the tablet, but Amazon offers a couple of bundles that might be of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Max 11 Bundles:<br>
</strong>- <strong>Stylus Bundle: </strong><a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1N3G19K" data-dimension112="4aaeeee0-d091-4544-b2bc-f5f626397170" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension48="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension25="$139.99"><del>$264.98</del><strong> $174.98<br>

<p>While other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire tablets</a> make plenty of sacrifices in the name of being cheap, the same can&apos;t be said about the Fire Max 11. It&apos;s about as premium of a tablet as you could ask for at this price point and is easily the best Fire Tablet for a variety of reasons.</p><p>It all starts with the 11-inch display, featuring a 2000x1200 resolution, so everything looks super crisp on the screen. Despite it not being the most powerful tablet out there, it&apos;s still more than capable of handling multitasking. And if you&apos;re not the biggest fan of Amazon&apos;s interface, there are ways around this so you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-android-apps-amazon-fire-tablet">install the Play Store</a> and load up a third-party launcher of your choice.</p><p>Those who are looking for a tablet that pulls double (or triple) duty, then you might be intrigued by the Fire Max 11 Productivity Bundle. In addition to the tablet, this bundle also includes a detachable back cover and keyboard, along with the Amazon Stylus Pen. This would normally set you back just north of $350, but Amazon&apos;s Cyber Monday deals have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW"><strong>knocked $130 off the price</strong></a>.</p><p>There&apos;s even a "bundle" that includes the tablet and stylus which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1N3G19K"><strong>also $90 off</strong></a>, bringing the price down to just under $175. You&apos;ll still need to grab a case, but hey, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0BPJYB2RP">Magnetic Slim Cover</a> is on sale for Cyber Monday too!</p>

While Soundcore is a trusted brand, its VR P10 earbuds are old news and only work properly with the Quest 2. Instead, you should get PrismXR Vega T1 headphones which just hit a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW"><strong>historic low price of $49.99</strong></a> on the day before Cyber Monday! The previous best price was $55.99 on Black Friday.</p><p>Aside from delivering ultra-low latency audio via the included USB-C dongle, PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds provide the full 27W passthrough capabilities it takes to keep the Quest 3 charged while playing. Soundcore VR P10 earbuds only offer 18W passthrough charging, which is <em>not enough</em> to charge the Quest 3, only to slow down the battery drain.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You are looking to keep VR play session audio in your ears only. The Quest's built-in speakers are great but sometimes it's better to not have the entire room hear the games you're playing, especially when they involve foul-mouthed gamers online. As a bonus, the USB-C dongle can be plugged into a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck for quicker wireless audio pairing than Bluetooth offers.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You find earbuds uncomfortable. PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds are super comfortable for me, but not everyone likes the feel of something in their ears.</p><p>PrismXR makes a ton of fantastic Meta Quest accessories including the Vega T1 earbuds. Aside from providing passthrough charging, Vega T1 earbuds offer ground-breaking 25ms latency for wireless audio. Comparatively, Bluetooth earbuds introduce between 50-100ms of latency which can be very uncomfortable in VR.</p><p>These earbuds come with a handy carrying case that keeps them charged — as you probably expect from a modern pair of wireless earbuds — so you don't have to worry about them being dead the next time you go to play.</p><p>Plus, with a great set of microphones on each bud, your friends will hear you better than ever before while gaming.</p>
