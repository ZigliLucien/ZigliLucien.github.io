<p>If your child is too young for their own cell phone but you still want them to be able to contact you to check in or in case of emergency, the Fitbit Ace LTE is a good option. It isn’t the first kids’ GPS and cellular watch, but it’s the first from Fitbit. And it offers some compelling features. But the subscription requirement, access to on-wrist games, and lack of sleep tracking might make you think twice.</p></p>

<p>The Fitbit Ace 3 is a simple device designed for younger kids that can track their activity and sleep while letting them personalize on-screen characters, get reminders to move, and more. It’s limited in functionality but for some parents (and kids), that’s all you want. At its current price, it’s a great tracker to test the waters before diving into something more feature rich.</p></p>

<p>There comes a time when kids get older and need some autonomy. When this is the case, you might be mulling over getting them a cell phone. However, many parents prefer not to get their kids cell phones at an early age. The new Fitbit Ace LTE is an interesting in-between device, a kids&apos;s smartwatch with, as the name implies, LTE cellular connectivity.</p><p>While both the Fitbit Ace LTE vs. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-ace-3-review">Fitbit Ace 3</a>, the brand&apos;s last kids&apos; activity tracker, might bear the same name and be for kids of around the same age, they are very different devices.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE&apos;s subscription-based connectivity could be a viable compromise you want for kids who need more autonomy or parents who want some peace of mind. But do you need it? Let’s examine how these two wrist-worn devices work to help you make the right decision for your little one.</p>
<h2 id="fitbit-ace-lte-vs-fitbit-ace-3-how-they-look-2">Fitbit Ace LTE vs. Fitbit Ace 3: How they look</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NLsazfA8qzZ9nP4PHNehtb" name="fitbit ace lte bands.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NLsazfA8qzZ9nP4PHNehtb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s consider the looks. The Fitbit Ace LTE comes in Spicy Pebble with a Moovin’ Band or Mild Pebble with a Strange Arcade band (other bands are available separately and interchangeable with the originals). Made of plastic, stainless steel, and glass, the device has a square smartwatch-style face that incorporates recycled materials. It is designed to be scratch, bump, and water-resistant. The band is made from recycled polyester yarn while the clasp and lugs are plastic and silicone.</p><p>Compatible with most phones running Android 11 or newer as well as iOS 15 or newer, the Fitbit Ace LTE has a scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Color OLED screen. It’s water-resistant to 50 meters via the 5ATM rating so kids can wear it underwater, in the bath, while playing outside in the rain, you name it. The watch even comes with a protective bumper case for especially clumsy kids. </p><p>Offering up to 16 hours of battery life, this is mostly affected by cellular connectivity and GPS tracking, which I’ll discuss in more detail in the next section. So, keep in mind that you need to recharge this tracker daily. It does, however, quick charge to 60 percent, or about 11 hours worth of battery life, in just 30 minutes, or to full in just over an hour.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PBWxtYkbKFekRmeNEqfW3m" name="Fitbit-ace-3-minions-watch-face-lifestyle-16x9.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace 3 with Minions watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBWxtYkbKFekRmeNEqfW3m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also designed for kids aged six to seven and older, the Fitbit Ace 3 comes in Black and Sport Red or Cosmic Blue and Astro Green with two buttons on the side. Employing a thin and rectangular activity tracker design, it comes with a silicone band with an adjustable plastic clasp. There are Fitbit branded and third-party band options you can swap in, including Fitbit’s licensed Minions character bands.</p><p>I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-ace-3-review">Fitbit Ace 3</a> when it was released and love how easy it is to pop the tracker out of the band and swap it with another. Even if you keep the same band, though, you’ll want to remove it and clean around the underside of the band to prevent skin irritation.</p><p>Equipped with a PMOLED touch-sensitive display, it also meets a 5ATM rating for use in and around water. It’s compatible with Android 10 or higher and Apple iOS 15 or higher devices.</p><p>Battery life is a big differentiator here since this watch can run for up to eight days per charge, though it takes about two hours to fully charge to 100 percent. This is because the Fitbit Ace 3 doesn’t connect to anything beyond a phone or other device via Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="fitbit-ace-lte-vs-fitbit-ace-3-the-specs-2">Fitbit Ace LTE vs. Fitbit Ace 3: The specs</h2>
<p>Before diving into the core features of these two fitness trackers for kids, let’s see how the specs compare.</p>

<p>As you can see, while the names of these two activity trackers for kids are similar, there is a lot more than meets the eye to the Fitbit Ace LTE.</p>
<h2 id="fitbit-ace-lte-vs-fitbit-ace-3-what-kids-can-do-with-them-2">Fitbit Ace LTE vs. Fitbit Ace 3: What kids can do with them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Y3vRauNmyR9PjzVTSwt67b" name="fitbit ace lte calls messages.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y3vRauNmyR9PjzVTSwt67b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE is not your standard wrist-worn step tracker for kids. It takes the experience much further. It includes built-in 4G LTE cellular connectivity via an included SIM card. This also means there’s a monthly subscription fee. At the time of this writing, it’s $9.99/mo. or $120/yr. and includes the ability for kids to call, message, and share location.</p><p>A purchase of the plan (the watch doesn&apos;t make much sense without one) also includes an Ace Band, with a new band at every annual renewal period. Six fun bands are available at launch, and there will likely be more down the line. The plan is on for half price through August 31, 2024.</p><p>Once set up and activated, your kids can use the Fitbit Ace LTE along with its built-in microphone and speaker to call and message up to 20 contacts. This can include trusted individuals like parents and caregivers, grandparents, close friends, and other family members.</p><p>The smartwatch also features GPS location tracking with advanced location technology powered by Google. Keep an eye on where your child is in real-time and ensure they aren’t leaving the school premises, for example, or keep track of older kids as they walk home alone from school or a friend’s house. Google says only parents or caregivers can see the location data, which is automatically deleted after a short time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kfj3cPrk24FGSV7tzu6dQb" name="fitbit ace 3 games apps.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kfj3cPrk24FGSV7tzu6dQb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, kids can play interactive 3D games in the Fitbit Arcade that use haptics, sounds, and the accelerometer. Think games that see them racing through space or going fishing; new games will be added every few months. While gaming from the wrist might sound like a distraction, gameplay is intentionally spaced out, rewarding kids only when they participate in active play in the real world. Essentially, the more the child moves in real life, the more game segments they can unlock in a virtual one. The School Time option, meanwhile, limits gameplay during school hours.</p><p>Further encouraging physical activity is a Noodle activity ring that appears on the watch’s home screen, recording their movement throughout each day. There’s a fun animation each time they reach a Move Goal, which can be achieved by walking, jumping, or even spinning in circles! The goal is to encourage kids to get at least an hour of physically active time per day, in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization.</p><p>Tying everything together is Eejie, a virtual character who lives in the virtual Bit Valley world on the watch. Fitbit’s reimagining of the Tamagotchi, kids keep Eejie happy by meeting their daily move goals. The more they move, the more items they earn for Eejie, like a ping pong table for its room or a skateboard for it to ride. Kids can connect with their friends’ Eejies to visit them in other parts of Bit Valley as well.</p><p>With Tap to Pay coming soon, older kids can leverage the built-in NFC sensor and use the watch to pay for items from compatible terminals, like at the convenience store or fast-food restaurant during lunch at school. All they need is a payment card loaded to the account. It’s a great way to teach older kids about the importance of saving and give them some independence to occasionally spend, too. Parents can set controls and receive real-time notifications whenever a child spends money.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE also has basic functions like an alarm clock, daily goals settings, and rewards. Kids get expected activity tracking along with an optical heart rate sensor. One glaring omission, however, is sleep tracking. This is presumably because daily charging and the always-on connectivity mean kids have to recharge overnight. But it’s an important feature that many parents might not be willing to forego.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WiVZKfqSBzdwGkMUkYKBCj" name="Fitbit-ace-3-on-wrist-lifestyle-16x9.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WiVZKfqSBzdwGkMUkYKBCj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the Fitbit Ace 3 compare? It’s very different. Introduced years ago in March 2021, the Fitbit Ace 3 offers the same reliable sleep tracking you get with other Fitbit devices, advising if your kids are getting enough sleep and good quality sleep, and when they go to bed and rise. Kids (and parents) can use the Fitbit app to schedule bedtime reminders and set silent alarms that wake kids up gently with a light buzzing on their wrists.</p><p>Parents can see if kids go to sleep when they say they do, how restless they are at night and their overall sleep patterns. Beyond just satisfying curiosity, this could suggest patterns, like that your child tends to be temperamental on nights when they don’t get good quality sleep or wake up groggy when they go to bed after a certain hour. Since you can see a full history in the app, it’s a useful feature and a shame it isn’t in the Fitbit Ace LTE as well.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace 3 activity tracker monitors kids’ daily movements as well with on-wrist reminders to move or for them to get up and stretch if they have been sitting too long. Along with basic steps, it also tracks Active Minutes. This presumably uses the built-in heart rate sensor to measure, though the app does not display heart rate data for kids. Kids can receive messages on the watch (they can’t reply to them) but only when it’s paired with a nearby connected and compatible smartphone.</p><p>There’s nothing as interactive as eejie with the Fitbit Ace LTE, but there are virtual badges, animated clock faces with characters like a rocket, bunny, or even Minions, and personalized avatars kids can enjoy. It’s on a much more rudimentary level on the much smaller screen. I do love the celebratory messages, however, when kids achieve goals along with virtual badges they can collect and view them in the app.</p><p>Other simple features in the Fitbit Ace 3 include a timer and stopwatch for racing with friends or timing chores. Kids can also see their stats on their wrists as they move throughout the day.</p>
<h2 id="fitbit-ace-lte-vs-fitbit-ace-3-which-should-you-buy-2">Fitbit Ace LTE vs. Fitbit Ace 3: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HeXUDsKN4SsLZBjVWxN4Gb" name="fitbit ace lte child jumping.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HeXUDsKN4SsLZBjVWxN4Gb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a complicated decision between the Fitbit Ace LTE vs. the Fitbit Ace 3. While the Fitbit Ace LTE offers a compelling proposition, it has a bit of an identity crisis. Some of the features, like NFC and GPS location tracking, are better suited to older kids with more autonomy, like teens and tweens. Other features, meanwhile, like games, are better suited to younger kids. So, who would want this watch?</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE is ideal for kids in the age 8-13 range who might not yet be old enough for a cell phone but are ready for a bit of independence. Some kids between these ages, for example, are allowed to walk home from school alone, go to the local park, leave school on lunch, or play with friends outside. The Fitbit Ace LTE would provide peace of mind.</p><p>But then, why not just get them a cell phone with a plan? There is a cost-benefit: even with a monthly plan, the Fitbit Ace LTE is still nowhere near what even the cheapest phone and plan would cost. Plus, the child doesn’t have to bring along a phone, easily staying in touch from the watch right on their wrist.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SWxRNnsYTYtSr9MTL4e96k" name="fitbit ace 3 wet.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SWxRNnsYTYtSr9MTL4e96k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For younger kids aged 6-10, the Fitbit Ace 3 is still a good option. It’s ultra-affordable and simple. While it doesn’t have games, per se, there are simple gamification features that young kids will love. They are engaging, not distracting. The battery life of more than a week and the detailed sleep tracking are the two biggest pluses of this tracker.</p><p>Bottom line: for older kids who aren’t yet ready for a cell phone, consider the Fitbit Ace LTE. It gives kids autonomy and parents peace of mind. But when you start getting into the teen years, chances are they’ll want something more substantial in a smartwatch, not to mention a phone!</p><p>For younger kids, stick with the Fitbit Ace 3. While having LTE connectivity for emergencies is great, the monthly cost adds up. Alternatively, consider placing a Bluetooth device tracker in their backpack or pocket, like the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 or any of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">the best Bluetooth trackers</a>. You might find that these satisfy your need for GPS location tracking at the very least.

<ul><li>The Google Play Store account deletion policy finally went live for app users.</li><li>Users can choose their accounts and data collected by app developers to be kept or removed entirely.</li><li>Google initially proposed the policy for app developers last April, with a deadline of May 31, 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Play Store is finally allowing users to easily delete their account data from Android Apps.  The feature that was introduced to developers by Google last April seems to be rolling out to everyone starting this week.</p><p>The new rule, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-account-data-deletion-policy">first proposed</a> by Google targeting apps that usually allow account creation for users, will now also allow them to delete accounts permanently. According to contributor Assemble Debug through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-store-app-account-deletion-3446261/">Android Authority</a>, Google Play Store is showcasing the new "Account deletion available" badge for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users under the Data Safety section for relevant apps.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="sW2hqwGDqUhso8n4dyfYBe" name="google-play-store-app-account-deletion.jpg" alt="Google Play Store App Account Deletion feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW2hqwGDqUhso8n4dyfYBe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="SMd7ZTxGWVsKVr2xDRG32e" name="google-play-store-app-account-deletion-01.jpg" alt="Google Play Store App Account Deletion feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SMd7ZTxGWVsKVr2xDRG32e.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="rZjrgnF4hAs6tBShGwBJ7e" name="google-play-store-app-account-deletion-03.jpg" alt="Google Play Store App Account Deletion feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rZjrgnF4hAs6tBShGwBJ7e.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Clicking the badge would take users to the Data deletion pane, which includes options like Delete app account and Manage app data. The former allows users to "submit a request" to app developers to delete their account data and other associated information that users have given while creating the account. The Delete app account section further provides the relevant developer’s site link. Upon clicking, it will showcase instructions for users on how to delete their accounts.</p><p>With the Manage app data, account holders can request the developer delete only specific data collected by the app, not the entire account. This data can include activity history, transaction history, and images and video.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:355px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:183.10%;"><img id="GRyXnnrFmViSkcrR5Ns8pL" name="Google-Play-account-data-deletion.gif" alt="Requesting account deletion from an app on the Google Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GRyXnnrFmViSkcrR5Ns8pL.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="355" height="650" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new findings appear on track as promised during the proposal with an early 2024 timeframe. Google mandated that app developers provide straightforward methods for account deletions online or via the app&apos;s web version. </p><p>This new ability is "especially important so that a user can request account and data deletion without having to reinstall an app," noted Bethel Otuteye, Senior Director of Product Management, Android App Safety, in the blog post.</p><p>When Google initiated this policy, it also gave developers a deadline of May 31, to include the easy app account deletion option for their apps. As the extension is only a couple of days away, Google Play Store bringing the new changes sounds achievable.</p>

<hr>
<p>It&apos;s not very often that we hear about a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids smartwatch</a>, let alone one that comes directly from Google and Fitbit. That&apos;s all changing, as the Fitbit Ace LTE looks to offer a completely different way to keep your kids healthy and motivated to move around.</p><p>Besides the bands and included Bumper Cover, the Ace LTE doesn&apos;t look too dissimilar from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Fitbit Versa 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a>. However, despite the similarities, the Ace LTE actually features the same internals as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, even down to the charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="RfkhsnJjwJJK75vd6gqH64" name="fitbit-ace-lte-hero-6.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE promo hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RfkhsnJjwJJK75vd6gqH64.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new wearable is water resistant up to 50 meters, while the screen uses Corning Gorilla Glass 3. In terms of connectivity, the Ace LTE is equipped with 4G LTE, 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, and there&apos;s even NFC. The NFC is particularly interesting, as "tap to Pay" will become available "in a couple of months," presumably via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>Along with being water-resistant and quite powerful, battery life should be able to keep up with your little ones. It&apos;s rated for up to 16 hours on a single charge, and thanks to fast charging, you can get another 11 hours of juice with just a 30-minute charge. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="e5J46exUPwAp8ioumS5i83" name="fitbit-ace-lte-back-glass-2.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE back glass" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5J46exUPwAp8ioumS5i83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for what the Fitbit Ace LTE keeps track of when it comes to workouts, this smartwatch sports a plethora of sensors. These include an accelerometer, optical heart rate, altimeter, magnetometer, gyroscope, and ambient light sensor. </p><p>As for software, Fitbit built this new interface on top of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS</a> in order to offer a "bespoke experience." This opened the doors for things like "Eejies," the "Noodle," and "interval-based gaming." According to Fitbit, Eejies are "customizable creatures that feed off daily activity." </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N4QiDd3VxtKKcQGeFBnca4" name="fitbit-ace-lte-overview.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE overview promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4QiDd3VxtKKcQGeFBnca4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only are they there to be right beside your kids, providing encouragement, but playing games and earning "arcade tickets" will unlock different customizations. Speaking of games, Google and Fitbit worked with different game studios to create interactive 3D games that can be played right from the watch. </p><p>At launch, the Ace LTE comes with six games, but more are planned to launch every quarter. The goal is to get your kids "at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day," along with incentivizing them by building streaks. This is similar to what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a> offers by closing rings, but children aren&apos;t penalized just for missing a day. </p><p>Instead, children are still rewarded for partial completion, which is a concept we hope is adopted for "adult" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>. That way, there&apos;s no guilt to be felt in the event that your little one wasn&apos;t feeling great and spent the day resting and recharging. </p><p>Thanks to the new Fitbit Ace app, parents can control and monitor everything that their children are doing with the watch. This includes adding up to 20 trusted contacts for your kids to call or text, along with viewing their location, and more. Do you want to make sure that your child is paying attention in class and not playing games? Set up School Time to keep things locked down while any activities are still monitored and accounted for.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2WQkPsqWbNxsNsvvijk8kj" name="fitbit-ace-app-overview.jpeg" alt="Overview of the Fitbit Ace app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WQkPsqWbNxsNsvvijk8kj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another benefit is that much like the best Fitbit wearables, the Ace LTE is platform-agnostic. You&apos;re able to install the Fitbit Ace app and set everything up, regardless of whether you&apos;re using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android</a> or an iPhone. All of this is made possible without needing to give your child a phone of their own.</p><p>By now, you might be wondering about how privacy comes into play with all of this. According to Google, the only people who can see your child&apos;s location and activity are parents. Additionally, location data is automatically deleted after 24 hours, while activity data remains in the app for a "maximum of 35 days" before it too is automatically deleted.</p><p>You also won&apos;t find any third-party apps, as your child is only able to access the content that is available out of the box and through subsequent software updates. The same goes for ads, as there aren&apos;t <em>any</em> ads being served on this kid&apos;s smartwatch. Google also confirmed that none of the data collected will be used for Google Ads. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="Kfwqsfc4eLPVxkXxKvebEo" name="fitbit-ace-lte-side.jpg" alt="Side view of the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kfwqsfc4eLPVxkXxKvebEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but not least, is <em>how</em> this smartwatch is capable of offering things such as LTE, voice calls, GPS, and messaging without a dedicated phone. Well, all of that is made possible by signing up for Ace Pass. </p><p>For $9.99 per month or $119.99 per year, Ace Pass includes the LTE data plan, access to the Arcade, and more. Google worked with different carriers to provide the best coverage possible, and the SIM card is already installed in the smartwatch. All you&apos;ll need to do is download the Fitbit Ace app, link the smartwatch, and get everything set up from there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="tHY7rcLSb7pLu4f7Vg9gFn" name="fitbit-ace-lte-hero.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ace LTE hero promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tHY7rcLSb7pLu4f7Vg9gFn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, all of this means that Ace Pass is required to "access most features." This is rather disappointing, as it essentially turns the smartwatch into a paperweight without a subscription unless, of course, you buy into it.</p><p>You can preorder the Fitbit Ace LTE starting today for $229.95 from Google, ahead of its June 5 release date. As an added bonus, if you sign up for the yearly subscription of Fitbit Ace Pass between now and August 31, you&apos;ll save 50%, along with receiving a free collectible Ace Band. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I used to take my Walkman (a WM-GX100) everywhere in my pre-teen years; it was just cool to be able to listen to music on the go, and I was attached to that thing — most of my vacation photos from that era had me rocking that Walkman. </p><p>When Sony&apos;s Discman became accessible a few years later, I switched over to those models. I ended up buying a few dozen cassettes (mostly alt rock), but the collection wasn&apos;t anywhere as extensive as my CD catalog, and I haven&apos;t paid any attention to them for the better part of two decades.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DtfoHVJC7G8yc8v7Gvsg8B" name="fiio-cp13-9.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DtfoHVJC7G8yc8v7Gvsg8B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These days, I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">Roon to stream my lossless music library</a> throughout the house, and I don&apos;t really use any analog media. But with a resurgence in retro tech, audio manufacturers are once again catering to this niche, and when Fiio said it was making a cassette player, I was interested.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8eWERitfU3jJDQHa9W7xt9" name="fiio-cp13-5.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player with cassettes next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8eWERitfU3jJDQHa9W7xt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CP13 is aimed squarely at users who have an existing cassette collection and want a reliable way of playing them back. Fiio says it wanted to faithfully recreate the look and feel of an analog device, and as such, it doesn&apos;t have Bluetooth connectivity or any other extras.</p>

<p>That said, you get some niceties: there&apos;s a built-in 1800mAh battery, and it charges over USB-C. The CP13 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Portable-Cassette-Earphone-Ultra-Low/dp/B0CYP26K5T">now available for $109 at Amazon</a>, and it is sold in interesting color options: Red and Silver, Sky Blue, White and Black (what I&apos;m using), and a Transparent model that looks amazing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qsibfC3MSi9Xh2GEtiFD3D" name="fiio-cp13-14.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player with Meteora next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsibfC3MSi9Xh2GEtiFD3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let&apos;s start with the positives: Fiio did an outstanding job with the design of the CP13, and the aluminum chassis means it is highly durable. The unit is smaller than Walkmans of yesteryear, and the design is on the minimalist side; I almost missed all the extraneous logos and branding that was a mainstay on all &apos;90s cassette players.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Bxm7dCgBE2umFPeDDwKsnB" name="fiio-cp13-7.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bxm7dCgBE2umFPeDDwKsnB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CP13 just has Fiio branding at the front and back, four buttons on the left — play, rewind, forward, and stop — and a volume knob along with 3.5mm jack and USB-C port at the top. You get a knurled texture to the volume knob that makes it easy to access, and the playback buttons have good tactility. There&apos;s a see-through window that lets you view the cassette, and there&apos;s a screen protector bundled in the box that can be installed over the glass pane.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qNcEKDu2RhNHnorTs7SqoA" name="fiio-cp13-8.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's lid indent" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qNcEKDu2RhNHnorTs7SqoA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue I have with the design is that the lid is a bit difficult to open. Fiio added an intent to one side, but ideally, it should have added the same on the other side as well — as it is, it takes a decent amount of force to open the lid. That said, there are no issues with the build quality whatsoever.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S3itWuCFigo3Gbab5kfs8C" name="fiio-cp13-12.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's cassette head" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S3itWuCFigo3Gbab5kfs8C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using the CP13 couldn&apos;t be easier; just slot in a cassette, and hit the play button. The cassette player works with all cassette types, has a higher voltage 4.2V motor, and uses an entirely analog audio chain. The JRC5532 op amp has enough power to drive just about any headset, and I used the CP13 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie600-long-term-review">Sennheiser IE600</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SZVXYgb2LUKUUywYHojUtD" name="fiio-cp13-18.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player plugged in to Fiio FT5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZVXYgb2LUKUUywYHojUtD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, it tends to vary significantly based on the recording itself. I listened to my early 2000s collection of nu metal and alt rock, and while the overall quality isn&apos;t as refined, there is an undeniable charm to analog media. The digital rendition of Meteora in my collection sounds noticeably better, but it isn&apos;t as much <em>fun </em>as listening to the cassette.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QQ3N5oXzJEisuC7poHGoDE" name="fiio-cp13-17.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player with Meteora artwork next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QQ3N5oXzJEisuC7poHGoDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, a lot of this has to do with nostalgia; I associate listening to cassettes with my pre-teen and teenage years, and that evokes a lot of memories. If you&apos;ve still got a cassette player from the &apos;80s or &apos;90s that&apos;s in a serviceable condition, you don&apos;t need the CP13. But if the cassette head is damaged or you need something new to listen to your cassette catalog, Fiio&apos;s cassette player is a great choice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F7r4seqEwLaMw5yFs2YmN9" name="fiio-cp13-2.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player design showcasing window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F7r4seqEwLaMw5yFs2YmN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a consumer product, the CP13 doesn&apos;t have anywhere close to the same finesse as cassette players of the past century; the noise floor is higher, you&apos;ll need to manually fiddle with the playback speed, and there isn&apos;t the ability to record. But as a tool that allows you to play back older cassettes and relive the nostalgia, it is outstanding.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is "combining Galaxy AI with Samsung Health" with its next update.</li><li>Its "on-device AI" will give the Galaxy Watch access to key features like an energy score, workout routines, racing past routes, and new HR metrics.</li><li>Samsung also promises "enhanced health algorithms" for better health accuracy.</li><li>One UI 6 Watch will add these Galaxy AI tools to Galaxy Watches "later this year," most likely in August. </li><li>Galaxy AI will be free "until the end of 2025."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung will add Galaxy AI features to both its Samsung Health app and Galaxy Watches this summer. Tailor-made sleep, health, and workout recommendations could help the Galaxy Watch series catch up to its fitness watch rivals — or even surpass them.</p><p>Starting this June, a select few One UI 6 Watch beta users will get to test out new personalized sleep and fitness coaching before these features roll out to the Galaxy Watch 4, 5, and 6 "later this year." We assume this will be in late August, shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> launch.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s announcement suggests some of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features will use "powerful on-device AI," while other metrics will rely on Samsung Health data from your phone or the cloud. The company announced features include an Energy Score that analyzes "average sleep time, sleep time consistency, bed/wake time consistency, sleep timing, previous day activity, sleeping heart rate, and heart rate variability" to quantify the user&apos;s daily condition.</p><p>Fitbit, Garmin, and Oura all have similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-fitbit-daily-readiness-score-and-how-do-i-use-it">Daily Readiness</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-body-battery">Body Battery</a> scores that help judge the impact of your sleep, workouts, and stress levels, so we&apos;re glad to see Samsung join their ranks. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XwpcJ4PyXxuDUywvu7cM35" name="one-ui-beta-photo-energy-score.JPG" alt="A woman athlete wearing a Galaxy Watch showing her Energy Score (88)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XwpcJ4PyXxuDUywvu7cM35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Energy Score Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Galaxy Watch owners will also get new "sleep indicators" that collect data on movement during sleep, sleep latency, heart rate, and respiratory rate and analyze it to help users "build better habits." </p><p>On that front, Samsung will provide "motivational tips, insights, and guidance" for customized health goals in the Samsung Health app. While we don&apos;t have a list of potential Wellness Tips, the sample below shows goals like lowering your body fat, consistent sleep streaks, and lowering your resting heart rate. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="w84scqx35wnfynxVtHD9s4" name="samsung-galaxy-ai-wellness-tips.JPG" alt="Samsung Health mock-up showing new Wellness Tips feature for One UI 6 Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w84scqx35wnfynxVtHD9s4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest Galaxy AI changes to Samsung Health relate to fitness. While the One UI 5 Watch update added personalized heart rate zones, this update will add aerobic and anaerobic threshold metrics to analyze performance. </p><p>Essentially, the aerobic threshold indicates the heart rate at which you can train for extended stretches without lactate buildup, burning fat instead of sugar. The anaerobic threshold is your max-effort level, where your body can&apos;t inhale oxygen quickly enough to convert it into energy, accumulating lactate in your blood until your muscles are too stiff to move. </p><p>Running watches like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> use this data to determine your training load and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>, guiding your running training. If Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI can bring this kind of tool to a <em>mainstream</em> smartwatch, it would be a real game-changer for the industry. </p><p>In addition, Samsung promises "greater precision and accuracy" for its health metrics thanks to "enhanced health algorithms" based on its AI. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ugwKVbQyzkfAMSnmKCK859" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-heart-rate.jpeg" alt="A heart rate graph on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ugwKVbQyzkfAMSnmKCK859.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, Samsung promises a new "Workout Routine" that lets you "combine various exercises for a personalized workout and seamlessly transition to the next exercise without stopping." It sounds very similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">Garmin&apos;s indoor workouts</a>, which lets you pick from thousands of potential exercises while building your routine. </p><p>While Apple and Google/Fitbit rely on workout videos, Samsung will take a more self-guided approach. We wonder if the Galaxy AI will recommend exercises based on your fitness level or if athletes must build workouts entirely by themselves. </p><p>Lastly, Samsung promises a "Race" mode to "track current and past progress when running or cycling." Racing previous routes is a common feature on fitness watches, and Apple added this option with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/watchos-9-review">watchOS 9</a>; we&apos;re glad to see Samsung catch up on this front. </p>
<h2 id="a-long-overdue-shift-in-priorities-2">A long-overdue shift in priorities</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jJwsEyvW7QxsbRkzqYvKE7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Pro-heart-rate-zones.jpeg" alt="Heart rate zones on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jJwsEyvW7QxsbRkzqYvKE7.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> last year, I found its health sensors could use some accuracy upgrades, and its barebones fitness features could use a revamp. So when Samsung announced Galaxy AI earlier this year, I noted how I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsungs-most-promising-fitness-tech-2024-galaxy-ai">more excited by Galaxy AI than Samsung&apos;s upcoming hardware</a>, for its potential to improve on both fronts. </p><p>Wednesday&apos;s announcement only bolsters those hopes. Whether you buy the Galaxy Watch 7 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> — or even if you have an older Galaxy Watch — you should have a much better experience courtesy of the One UI 6 Watch update.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s not a certainty. AI enhancements don&apos;t magically make everything better. But there is precedent. Fitness brands like Garmin and Fitbit depend on background algorithms to analyze your health metrics and workout data and tell you how tired or fit you are. </p><p>Plus, watches need reliable algorithms to determine heart rate data when the sensors aren&apos;t perfectly aligned with your skin. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> received Google&apos;s HR algorithm from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and both have performed very well in HR accuracy tests. If Samsung truly has "enhanced health algorithms," that&apos;ll help it keep up.</p><p>Neither Apple nor Samsung has successfully implemented personalized fitness recommendations before now. Both brands have a higher bar to clear than the competition and more "casual" users who might hurt themselves with bad advice. So, for Samsung to beat Apple to the punch is a pretty big deal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-black-03.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My main question is whether or not you&apos;ll have to pay for these insights or not. We&apos;ve heard rumors that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-us-price-subscription-rumors">Galaxy Ring will require a subscription</a> of $10/month or less on top of a $300+ price tag. Samsung has traditionally given users free Samsung Health insights, but if its new smart ring has a subscription, it&apos;s no great leap to assume the Galaxy Watches will as well. </p><p>Samsung&apos;s press release says, "Galaxy AI features will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy smartphone devices," but that wording could leave the door open for a subscription on Galaxy rings and watches in the meantime—and we don&apos;t know how much it&apos;ll cost once that grace period ends.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 already has many of Samsung&apos;s promised Galaxy AI insights via Fitbit Premium, but that costs $10/month after a six-month free trial. If Samsung gives that same data for free, it would seriously undercut Google and Fitbit; even if Samsung eventually charges money, Galaxy Watch owners could get over a year of free Wellness Tips and Energy Score data first.</p><p>I still have a ton of questions about One UI 6 Watch and how it&apos;ll compare to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> for fitness. But today&apos;s announcement is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.</p>

The ULT Field 1 is the smallest of the three ULT POWER SOUND Bluetooth speakers the company offers now, but don’t let its diminutive size fool you! Sometimes, big things come in little packages; you’ll find that the ULT Field 1 is one such “little package.” </p><p>Want something highly mobile but large enough to expand your phone’s sound for a trip to the park or beach? The ULT Field 1 may be just what you&apos;re looking for.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MkJhz8KbMCimjxtBA4JLRP" name="sony-ult-field-1-camping.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MkJhz8KbMCimjxtBA4JLRP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This eight-inch long or tall (it can be used lying on its side or standing on end) Bluetooth speaker supports Bluetooth 5.3 and a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codes</a> like SBC, AAC, and LDAC codecs. For a mono speaker setup, the single tweeter and single woofer units produce a satisfying amount of clarity and warm audio with ULT enabled. That’s the backlit button on the top of the speaker, where you’ll also find the other controls. </p><p>The power button and Bluetooth pairing buttons also have status indicator lights; next to those, you have the play/pause/call button and the volume buttons. There’s also a handy carry strap on the unit&apos;s top edge, which can expand if necessary. The rear of the device has a rubber plug/cap, which helps it maintain that IP67 rating and keep water and dust out of the USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LzwHFLsLwWNj6tUtViKybN" name="sony-ult-field-1-ult-closeup.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzwHFLsLwWNj6tUtViKybN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With an IP67 rating, you can easily take Sony&apos;s ULT Field 1 to the beach and on other dusty, dirty excursions worry-free. However, I’d recommend buying it in one of the other colors because the off-white will look “well-traveled” pretty quickly. Those other colors are black, forest gray, and orange.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="txBgDPHPpedVKTavLD9CMM" name="sony-ult-field-1-plug.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/txBgDPHPpedVKTavLD9CMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The speaker supports multipoint connections (two at a time) and can be used as a stereo pair when connected to another ULT Field 1 unit using Sony’s Music Center app. And speaking of that app, it&apos;s actually pretty basic here. Its most important features will be the ability to control the sound and make a stereo pair if you have two units.</p>

<p>Controlling the sound is pretty basic compared to the options you get with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-wear-review">ULT WEAR headphones</a>. In this case, you can only turn ULT on or have it off and use your own custom sound via the three-band EQ. However, since you&apos;ll likely be outdoors with this small speaker, the nuance you can control with an EQ with more bands will likely be lost to the ether and inaudible.</p>

<p>Let’s establish something from the start: this isn’t a party speaker for your country barn summer soiree or sunset beach bonfire. This is a “personal speaker” with enough volume for a small group of a few pals to hit the beach and have a kickback or to take to the park and relax to some Coltrane. Maybe you pack it, take it to the AirBnB you and your buddies rented for your week-long getaway, and use it in the backyard. Enough to provide some atmosphere and move your booties but nowhere near loud enough to elicit “disturbing the peace” calls to the police from neighbors.</p><p>To test the audio quality, I took the speaker to a few parks and to the beach. I used it alongside my JBL Charge 4, which is currently my and my wife’s favorite take-along portable speaker. After my testing, the ULT Field 1 will absolutely be our new go-to.</p><p>I went to one park next to a busy main street where a concert was proceeding in another section of the park. I tried to get as far away from that as possible, but the music coming from that section was still audible. Here, I walked about 30 feet away from the speaker before the audio was masked by traffic and other noise.</p>

<p>The second park I visited was during the morning, around 10 a.m. The local private schools use it for their PE field, and it just so happened that there were around 50 high school students there that morning. Here, I was able to get roughly 50 feet away from the speaker before the vocals became somewhat indecipherable.</p>

<p>Comparing the FIELD 1 to the Charge 4, I can tell you that the ULT function definitely makes a difference. I should note that the Charge 4 uses a less dynamic Bluetooth codec, SBC, while during my testing, the Field 1 used AAC, which has more “resolution.” I can also tell you that the ULT Field 1 sounds better when that function is activated than when it&apos;s not. The sound is flatter with ULT off, but turning it on immediately imbues presence and depth to the sound, making the music fuller and more robust close-up and at greater distances like 50 feet.</p><p>The ULT Field 1 does support LDAC, which is a nice addition, but I was unable to get it to work with that codec using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>, which both support LDAC. You may have better luck than me.</p><p>We’ve discussed “auditory masking” in other articles here, so keep that in mind when using a speaker like this outdoors. At the beach, the sound of the waves will compete with the higher frequencies in some of your music. Orchestral music, for example. Bottom-heavy songs sounded great when I listened to my music in the park, and instrumental music like R&B, which still had more mids and bottoms, also sounded great. However, music from the Chevalier score lost elements of the mix at 50 feet away in the park. Soft sections of violins were inaudible at that distance, so you’ll want to be closer if classical is your jam.</p><p>The only issue I found with the sound output from the Field 1 was that when you turn the volume up to its max and play a track with a really heavy bottom end, like Skrillex&apos;s “Mumbai Place,” I ran into a decent amount of distortion. That combination was a bit too much for this small unit.</p><p>Aside from music, the speaker can also be used for phone calls, video calls, and whatever audio is output from your phone. I found the volume excellent, and the person on the other end said I sounded clear. What is also clear is the accuracy of the battery life that Sony claims you’ll get. I let the speaker play with ULT activated the volume level set to 25 (it has 50 steps of volume), and the Field 1 lasted just under 12 hours. Turning ULT off will get you more playback time should you need it.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-sony-ult-field-1-2">Should you buy the Sony ULT Field 1?</h2>
<p>The Sony ULT POWER SOUND series of speakers brings the BOOM! But, in this case, that “BOOM” actually translates to a fuller sound for outdoor use. Couple that with an IP67 rating for water and dust ingress, solid battery life, and a small footprint with good sound output, and you have a speaker well worth considering for your summer outdoor shenanigans.</p><p>You can check out our roundup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">the best Bluetooth speakers</a> if you need something larger than what this offers, but for most casual get-togethers, the Sony ULT Field 1 is a great option for portable Bluetooth audio.</p>

In the intervening five years, I used the Oasis extensively; after my monitor, the e-reader gets the most amount of screen time every week.</p>

<p>All that usage has taken a toll on the battery life; I used to get a week&apos;s worth of use between charges, but these days, the battery barely lasts long enough to read one book. While that isn&apos;t as big a problem at home, I&apos;m not confident in its ability to last a transatlantic flight (not that I&apos;m making those journeys anymore, but that&apos;s a matter for another day).</p><p>The other issue I have with the Oasis is that it charges via Micro-USB. This wasn&apos;t a problem back in 2019, but nowadays, the Oasis is the only device in my daily rotation that still uses the Micro-USB port. I didn&apos;t think much of it at the time, as I figured Amazon would launch a follow-up model with USB-C.</p><p>But it&apos;s clear that Amazon has no intention of doing so. The 10th Gen Kindle Oasis is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/All-new-Kindle-Oasis/dp/B07L5JKKG8">still on sale in India</a> as of writing, but it&apos;s unavailable everywhere else, and unlikely to be restocked. Amazon lists the international edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07L5GDTYY">for just $135</a>, and while that is a stellar price, it isn&apos;t eligible for delivery in the U.S. Given that Amazon has refreshed all the other models in the series, it&apos;s evident that there are no plans to do so with the Oasis. That&apos;s annoying, because even after half a decade, the Oasis continues to be the best e-reader around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wiVZGK7rDSHTs3JkvmfurQ" name="kindle-oasis-3.jpg" alt="Kindle Oasis in-hand showing the settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wiVZGK7rDSHTs3JkvmfurQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of what makes the Oasis stand out is the asymmetric design and the aluminum build; it just feels better to hold and use than any other e-reader. But what I like the best about the device — and why I continue to use it daily — is the page turn buttons. Physical page turn buttons absolutely make a difference when reading an e-book, and the ability to change orientation and use the buttons with either hand is the reason I use the Oasis over other e-readers.</p><p>The Oasis nails the dimensions as well, and the 7-inch screen is ideally suited for reading books. Coming in at 194g, it isn&apos;t too heavy to hold one-handed either. Essentially, what I&apos;m trying to get at is that the Oasis is still the best e-reader ever made, and it&apos;s frustrating that Amazon has no interest in making a new one.</p><p>Amazon is instead focusing its attention on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle Scribe</a> and the Paperwhite Signature, with the latter in particular taking up the mantle of the Oasis. The Paperwhite Signature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition/dp/B08B495319">more affordable at $189</a>, charges via USB-C and the Qi standard, and has E Ink&apos;s Carta 1200 panel with 300ppi pixel density. But there are no page turn buttons, and the plastic design isn&apos;t anywhere as nice to hold as the Oasis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="soSizkdxnYSASYRFTubB4R" name="kindle-oasis-5.jpg" alt="Kindle Oasis in dark mode holding in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soSizkdxnYSASYRFTubB4R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re a long-time Oasis user and are looking for a new e-reader, the best option may be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review">Onyx Boox Page</a>. It also has a 7-inch E Ink Carta 1200 panel, physical page turn buttons, and weeks-long battery life. Onyx&apos;s software has a lot going for it as well — that was evident after using the Note Air 3 — and at $249, the Boox Page slots in at the same price point as the Oasis. While I haven&apos;t used Kobo&apos;s e-readers, the Libra Colour looks like a decent alternative, offering a color E Ink screen along with page turn buttons.</p><p>That said, I exclusively used Kindles for over a decade because of the convenience. While I buy from smaller publishers these days, a chunk of my e-book library is tied to my Amazon account, and the Kindle e-store — along with Kindle Unlimited — makes buying and reading e-books a breeze. But with Amazon unwilling to release a new high-end e-reader, it is becoming increasingly clear that I&apos;ll need to switch to Onyx or Kobo&apos;s products once my Oasis becomes unusable.</p>

<ul><li>T-Mobile is buying most of U.S. Cellular's wireless operations for $4.4 billion with an additional debt of $2 billion.</li><li>The deal aims to improve mobile service, especially 5G access in rural areas.</li><li>U.S. Cellular customers can retain their current plans or switch to T-Mobile, which could offer lower prices and more benefits.</li><li>The acquisition comes just after T-Mobile agreed to purchase Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>T-Mobile announced on Tuesday (May 28) that it will acquire almost all of U.S. Cellular&apos;s wireless operations, including wireless customers and stores, as well as certain specified spectrum assets. </p><p>The carrier said they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/uscellular-acquisition-operations-assets">sealed the deal</a> for about $4.4 Billion. T-Mobile will get around 30% of U.S. Cellular&apos;s wireless spectrum, and this deal aims to improve connectivity across the board, especially for those living in remote rural areas. The carrier says that closing this deal will provide U.S. customers nationwide access to the fastest 5G and roaming network, also in areas where the network was previously limited. </p><p>"The Un-carrier is all about shaking up wireless for the good of consumers and this deal is another way for us to continue doing even more of that," says T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. U.S. Cellular is said to retain 70 percent of its wireless spectrum and towers, leasing space of around 2,100 additional towers to T-Mobile.<br>
<br>
Laurent Therivel, CEO of U.S. Cellular, adds that the transaction will provide its customers "access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades, and other T-Mobile benefits."</p><p>For now, U.S. Cellular customers still have the choice to stick to their current plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan with no switching costs, which includes Un-carrier benefits such as streaming and free international data roaming.</p><p>If all goes as planned, the deal is expected to close in mid-2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:853px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Mj4P8iQyLCsDwu8wsWbkkV" name="t-mobile-test_2.jpg" alt="Person using cell phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mj4P8iQyLCsDwu8wsWbkkV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="853" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This acquisition could mean a few things for other cellular carriers in the U.S. wireless market, one of which is potentially lower prices. With T-Mobile&apos;s bigger coverage area, it might pressure other companies like AT&T and Verizon to offer competitive prices and offers to customers in order to retain them. </p><p>"As customers from both companies will get more coverage and capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up – and even more consumers will benefit," Sievert added.</p><p>An analyst from Wedbush Securities analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/tmobile-tds-us-cellular-67d4d2a85fd73338334987933b468a40">told</a> the Associated Press that "the U.S. consumer has less choice, but there is more competition, and this could drive prices lower."</p><p>However, on the flip side, if T-Mobile monopolizes the market, especially in places where other networks lack coverage, such as rural areas, it might be tough for the company to offer competitive prices on the pretext of being the only player in the market. Recently, T-Mobile told customers on legacy plans that they would be charged more per line as a result of "rising costs."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you. We're adjusting prices to respond to rising costs, but we are committed to offering low prices and best value in postpaid wireless. We offer customers more for every dollar they spend than ever before, especially when you consider taxes & fees included. ^KenStone https://t.co/8DIvLVByJj<a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp/status/1793280595076005912">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It remains to be seen how other wireless carriers will react to this acquisition by T-Mobile, as U.S. Cellular is the fourth largest wireless carrier in the United States, albeit with fairly limited coverage.</p><p>The announcement comes not long after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-mint-mobile-acquisition">T-Mobile agreed to purchase Mint Mobile</a> and Ultra Mobile via an acquisition of parent company Ka&apos;ena Corporation.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Asgard's Wrath 2's Meta Quest 3 update is finally out, with v5.0.1535650 totaling 7.8GB of updated content.</li><li>The new update includes upgraded textures, large enemy and character models, and other graphical enhancements for Meta's most powerful VR headset.</li><li>Quest 3 gamers can choose between fidelity mode and performance mode to select better visuals or a better framerate.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The long-awaited Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 graphics upgrade for the Meta Quest 3 has finally arrived, bringing with it 7.8GB of graphically upgraded content. Gamers can look forward to notably upgraded texture resolution in the environment, plus detail found throughout objects and other areas of the world.</p><p>To update the game, just head to your library tab on the Meta Quest 3, tap the three-dot overflow menu next to the Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 listing, and tap update. Once you&apos;ve launched the game, open up the game&apos;s settings menu, tap user interface, and then enable Enhanced Rendering Features.</p><p>Note that checking this box toggles between "performance" and "fidelity" modes, as it&apos;s often referred to on consoles like the PS5. Leaving the box unchecked will run the game on Quest 3  at a higher resolution and a higher framerate than Quest 2 while checking the box will bring the framerate down to 72 FPS but upgrade the rest of the visual experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s upcoming first-generation smart ring is passing through its certification hoops, but its stop at the FCC spills more than expected.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/05/28/samsungs-galaxy-ring-stops-through-fcc-and-shows-off-everything/">DroidLife</a>, the Galaxy Ring is listed under the FCC ID "A3LSMQ503" within its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=GVBTaMEJp%2FstsNDsvLc3Aw%3D%3D&fcc_id=A3LSMQ503">official report</a>. From the listing, it seems confirmed that the device will hit the market with nine models, each with its respective ring size. Information about eight of the sizes, minus SM-Q503, are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>SM-Q500 (Size 10)</li><li>SM-Q501 (Size 11)</li><li>SM-Q502 (Size 12)</li><li>SM-Q505 (Size 5)</li><li>SM-Q506 (Size 6)</li><li>SM-Q507 (Size 7)</li><li>SM-Q508 (Size 8)</li><li> SM-Q509 (Size 9)</li></ul>

<p>The FCC&apos;s listing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> contained battery information for each device. Ring sizes five through seven will feature a 17mAh battery. Sizes eight through eleven boast 18.5mAh batteries, while the larger size 12 Galaxy Ring sees a 22.5mAh capacity battery.</p><p>The listing continues by quickly mentioning a "charging cradle" for the Galaxy Ring. More substantial information about it is unknown, aside from a picture of the cradle&apos;s apparent underside to highlight the FCC&apos;s marking. The listing reportedly details that Samsung will label each cradle according to whichever model (and ring size) a consumer has purchased.</p>

<p>The publication also picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=7352716">official photos of the rings</a>, courtesy of Samsung. The pictures show off the device in various sizes and from different angles. Additionally, it seems the device will connect to devices via Bluetooth LE.</p><p>An earlier leak from March suggested that the Galaxy Ring could run for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">about 10 days</a>. It then dipped into the potential battery sizes of the device, purporting its smallest size could see a 14.5mAh battery while the largest could sit at 21.5mAh. However, with the current FCC listing, those numbers have increased slightly at both ends.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">we&apos;ve heard rumors</a> about Samsung&apos;s potential to bring nine Galaxy Ring sizes to consumers based on American ring sizes. There was speculation that the ninth would either be given an "SM-Q503" or "SM-Q504" model number; we&apos;ve now seen that it&apos;s the former. Still, information about SM-Q503 is unknown. There&apos;s a chance this device takes the ring size up to 13, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>We expect Samsung to debut its Galaxy Ring, among several other devices, during its summer Unpacked event. Rumors state this could happen on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>
