<p>Google's latest midrange beauty literally just hit store shelves a few weeks ago, but you can already buy the unlocked Pixel 8a from Amazon and get a free $50 gift card with your purchase. There's a good chance that the phone will get some kind of discount when Prime Day finally hits, but this gift card deal is sure to disappear soon. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5Z5CR1X/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b7f4eaa4-dbc0-4d48-a887-293fd04a69b5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="2.

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus is pretty much a masterclass in balance, packing loads of premium technology, years of guaranteed OS upgrades, and AI-powered software features into a compact phone that feels a little like an iPhone. If you order the S24 Plus unlocked from Amazon today you'll instantly receive a nice $150 discount, no strings attached and no trade-in required. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDR2X3M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f54362e0-ae78-4e7c-8484-a3f72593ba1b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Amazon is currently selling the Motorola Razr Plus for 35% off, which is the biggest price drop that the innovative foldable has ever received by a considerable margin. For $649.99, you're getting a clamshell device with an elegant, versatile construction, Snapdragon chip, and one of the best cover displays on any flip phone yet. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2X87QW4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ff60c6f9-7943-4bf0-a13c-f1c541c15aac" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="5.

<p>It might not have the giant screen of the Razr+ or the flagship-tier processor, but it's hard to argue with a brand-new foldable phone for under $500. Plus, it's got a more eye-friendly 6.9-inch pOLED display than Samsung's foldables and a plush vegan leather back for extra style points. Oh, and it's <em>very</em> hard to argue with $250 off for this pre-Prime Day deal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Camera-Vanilla-170-82/dp/B0CGWDCS3L" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ac512ba7-dfa3-4fca-befd-0f29953f60ca" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2024-xa0-2">When is Prime Day 2024? </h2>
<p>The dates of Prime Day 2024 haven&apos;t officially been revealed yet, but Amazon has confirmed that the sale will take place in July once again. The 2023 and 2022 sale events took place on July 11th-12th and 12th-13th, respectively, so we can probably expect this year&apos;s Prime Day to occur around the same time. We&apos;ll update this page once we learn more. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-best-prime-day-phone-deals-2">How do I find the best Prime Day phone deals?</h2>
<p>Naturally, if you want to find the best Android phone deals during Prime Day 2024, I recommend bookmarking this page and checking back on a regular basis. If you want to look beyond the confines of Android Central (<em>traitor!</em>), you can also sign up for one of Amazon&apos;s weekly newsletters or do some price history tracking on a site like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.camelcamelcamel.com">Camelcamelcamel.com</a>. You&apos;ll see a lot of prices jumping up and down over the next few weeks, so using a price tracker can help you stay oriented once the madness begins next month. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-an-amazon-prime-member-to-shop-on-prime-day-xa0-2">Do I need to be an Amazon Prime member to shop on Prime Day? </h2>
<p>Prime Day was specifically designed to benefit paying Prime subscribers, so you&apos;ll need to be a member if you want to enjoy the vast majority of discounts during the sale. Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon offers a 30-day free trial</strong></a> that lets you explore all of the benefits of Prime Day for a full month without paying a cent (don&apos;t sign up until July 1st, just in case). You can also expect many of Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors (Best Buy, Walmart, etc) to be launching rival sales of their own around the same time, and those won&apos;t require a membership.</p>

<ul><li>A discovery made by the developers of SponsorBlock shows that YouTube has started experimenting with server-side "injectable" ads.</li><li>This method would see ads become one with the streamed video content instead of being presented to your device as a separate entity.</li><li>YouTube's new efforts would make it extremely difficult for ad blockers should this become widespread, though it might not signal the end of them.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Developers of a crowdfunded ad blocker have reportedly spotted evidence of YouTube&apos;s efforts to make it more difficult to block ads.</p><p>The folks who developed SponsorBlock reported via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SponsorBlock/status/1800835402666054072">an X post</a> that YouTube might make ad blocking harder with "server-side" ads (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/youtube-ad-injection/">9to5Google</a>). The creators call it an "injection," which would mean that ads are a part of the video&apos;s stream instead of a separate entity.</p><p>This poses a problem as ad blockers grab an ad&apos;s information (data) through that disconnect between it and the streamed video. The developers go in depth through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gist.github.com/ajayyy/f7b1807e13731c25cef4c2c057d022bc#file-faq-md">a GitHub FAQ</a>, stating that this likely isn&apos;t the end of ad blockers in the general sense. However, things will become increasingly difficult if this moves through.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1deagru/comment/l8ayj4z/">user on Reddit</a> has already spotted these new server-side ads as YouTube kickstarted its test. Their post details their usage of Firefox and the uBlock browser extension for snuffing out ads in videos.</p><p>They report that this isn&apos;t working; even changing a few settings has proved useless.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1deagru/this_is_going_to_break_adblockers_as_well">This is going to break adblockers as well</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>YouTube has been at war with ad blockers for a while now, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-three-strikes-policy-for-ad-blockers">giving users three strikes</a> before cutting them off from its service. There was even word of YouTube emailing users about their continued usage of ad blockers and how doing so would result in a loss of access.</p><p>The company then stepped up its battle against ad block creators, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-blocks-third-party-ad-blockers">warning that those attempting</a> to do so and create such extensions would lose API access.</p><p>In late May, users reported encountering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-is-glitching-for-adblock-users-but-its-not-what-you-think">some frustrating issues</a> when enabling an ad blocker on YouTube. Folks encountered videos skipping to the end or even muting if the platform detected an ad blocker. YouTube promptly denied those issues as being part of its efforts to combat blockers.</p><p>All of these issues have reportedly led to an increase in ad block uninstalls, leaving users with the choice of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> or sitting still until that "skip ad" button appears.</p>

Between now and June 23, new streaming customers can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.max.com/collections/watch-free"><strong>one-week free trial of Max</strong></a>, simply by signing up for a plan. Although you will have to choose a plan and input your card information, you can simply cancel before you&apos;re charged if you don&apos;t want to pay for the service after the trial.</p><p>It&apos;s a great streaming service deal for those hoping to watch something specific on the service, and it&apos;s also the best Max deal to come along since its last free trial in 2020.</p>

<p>For the first time since 2020, Max has launched a one-week free trial for new streaming customers. While the deal requires buyers to sign up for one of the company's streaming plans and provide a credit card, users can simply take advantage of the deal and cancel at the end of the trial before their cards get charged.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.max.com/collections/watch-free" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="eadf8a16-3bf1-4437-bf18-65c56a27fa63" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$20.99/month" data-dimension48="$20.99/month">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;ve been considering Max and want to try it out without committing to a plan; you&apos;re hoping to watch something specific on Max but don&apos;t want to purchase the streaming service.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you don&apos;t want to sign up for a plan or input your card information, even for a cancelable free trial; you already have a Max plan.</p><p>Max offers many of the most popular television shows on streaming, though it rarely offers any kind of free trial programs. Right now, Max is offering free one-week trials for new customers of its plans, with the deal set to end on June 23.</p><p>Those who take advantage of the free trial will need to sign up for one of the company&apos;s plans, which now have price points of $9.99 a month, $16.99 a month and $20.99 a month. However, buyers can cancel anytime, even if it means only using the free trial, then canceling to avoid being charged for the service.</p><p>The streaming service had launched a similar free trial in 2020, though this is the first time the company has offered the one-week deal since then. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-shares-new-rise-in-prices-for-ad-free-and-ultimate-plans">Max also raised the prices of its streaming plans by $1</a> earlier this month, so the re-launching of the free trial comes at a good time.</p><p>To be sure, one week is <em>probably</em> long enough to binge one of the shorter shows or a limited series, depending on what you&apos;re hoping to watch.</p>

<ul><li>HTC has launched its latest midrange Android phone, the U24 Pro with a 6.8-inch OLED display with curved glass.</li><li>The device's rear panel offers a triple camera array with a 50MP primary lens, a 50MP telephoto sensor, and an 8MP wide plus depth sensor.</li><li>The U24 Pro is powered by the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC, packed with AI camera enhancements.</li><li>Consumers in the E.U. can grab it for €564.00 (roughly $605).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>HTC is back with another midrange Android device that&apos;s come out of the leftfield and has some interesting changes over last year&apos;s.</p><p>HTC&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.htc.com/eu/smartphones/htc-u24-pro/">showcase</a> of the U24 Pro begins with its 6.8-inch OLED display with a maximum 120Hz refresh rate. Design-wise, the U24 Pro offers a glass screen that slightly curves along the right and left sides of the device. The phone&apos;s edges have been upgraded with an angled design to help users grip the phone with security and comfort.</p><p>The company attributes the device&apos;s fluidity and performance to Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a> SoC. HTC states the chip helps the U24 Pro with a 50% increase in graphical rendering and 20% better power efficiency.</p><p>The rear panel of the HTC U24 Pro has been upgraded in a few ways, such as its heat compression and sandblasting. The company states the latter should help the device resist fingerprints and impact if dropped.</p><p>Camera changes are made evident as HTC revamps its rear array, opting for a design that looks like an exclamation mark. The initial vertical array consists of two lenses: the 50MP main sensor and the 50MP telephoto lens. Beneath that lies the lonely 8MP wide plus depth camera sensor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1618px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XVemKnn3NEJUvGks4pYruJ" name="htc-u24-pro-space-navy-hero-wide.jpg" alt="The HTC U24 Pro in Space Navy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XVemKnn3NEJUvGks4pYruJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1618" height="910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>HTC states that its primary camera takes in roughly 130% more light to benefit those taking night shots for more "vivid" colors. The upgraded telephoto camera can reach up to 2x optical zoom for increased detail capture. Any videographers can utilize the U24 Pro&apos;s 4K resolution recording with OIS (optical image stabilization).</p><p>The front-facing camera sits at 50MP, which is stronger than what HTC offered in 2023 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/htc-u23-pro-launch">the U23 Pro</a>. However, this year&apos;s iteration forgoes the macro lens, dropping to a triple camera array instead of a quad configuration.</p><p>HTC has also thrown in some AI features such as AR stickers, blur and exposure editing tools, and a face selector for the best group shot. The group shot feature is similar to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Pixel Best Take</a>, which lets users browse through the many faces folks made during a photo op and choose the right combination.</p>

<p>HTC&apos;s latest midrange isn&apos;t just for reality as the company states users can pair it with its VR headset, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/htcs-new-oculus-quest-competitor-can-be-worn-like-a-pair-of-glasses">VIVE XR Elite</a>. The device can stream content to the VR headset, giving users access to their content in a completely new way.</p><p>Keeping your phone going through all of this is a 4,600mAh battery like its predecessor. Consumers are treated to a charging boost overall as the device features 60W quick charging support and 15W for wireless chargers.</p><p>Other details include a fingerprint sensor, a 3.5mm audio jack, a microSD card slot, and an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance.</p><p>The HTC U24 Pro delivers 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage configuration in Space Navy. In the E.U., the device observes a €564.00 price tag, which equates to roughly $605. It&apos;s currently unknown when (or if) HTC plans to bring this midrange to the U.S. market.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp is highlighting a few updates to improve its calling experience across Android, iOS, and PC.</li><li>The app now supports "Speaker spotlight" which highlights the person talking and moves them to the front alongside audio during screen share.</li><li>These updates will roll out over the "next few weeks" and join other updates to improve calling through the MLow codec.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp details a few improvements coming to its platform that are aimed squarely at your calling experience.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/better-calling-across-desktop-and-mobile">blog post</a>, one of the first updates involves a "speaker spotlight." WhatsApp states that when on a call with multiple people, the one speaking will appear first on your screen. Accompanying this will be a highlight to ensure everyone recognizes who&apos;s got the mic.</p><p>Next, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> is bringing audio to screen-sharing sessions. The platform states that users can now watch videos together or anything else with audio, and your friends and family will hear it, too.</p><p>WhatsApp&apos;s latest update concludes by expanding its participants list for a call to 32 people. This applies to video calls, and every device running WhatsApp supports this new expansion of the feature.</p><p>The service states that these updates will arrive on Android, iOS, and desktop computers "over the next few weeks."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GZQ7WhwkZAP4B6C9BcG7KB" name="whatsapp-calling-updates.jpg" alt="WhatsApp highlights new features to make calls better on desktop and mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GZQ7WhwkZAP4B6C9BcG7KB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta-owned app highlights its recent attempts to better the audio and video calling experience through the MLow codec. The codec improves call reliability while mobile users see updates to noise and echo cancellation. Other video updates include bringing a higher resolution for users with quicker internet speeds.</p><p>Additionally, older Android and iOS devices can still enjoy crisp voice calls despite rocking some aged hardware.</p><p>These updates for calls on WhatsApp are light, but it follows behind some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-brings-major-design-changes">major design changes</a>. The Head of WhatsApp Design, Idit Yaniv, stated that the app&apos;s redesign was made with three principles in mind: to be fresh, approachable, and simple.</p><p>The old navigation bar with Chats, Status, and Calls tabs is now positioned at the bottom of the UI, and some new chat filters are entering the mix. WhatsApp also offers its own dark mode now, a highly requested user feature over the years.</p>

<p>Honor&apos;s clamshell phone is finally here as the Chinese company looks to enter direct competition with Samsung.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/honor-magic-v-flip-launch-specs-price-availability.html">CNBC</a>, the Honor Magic V Flip is a China-exclusive device for now, but that may change as others in its portfolio have arrived internationally.

<ul><li>Google is adding a feature in Android 15 to block shady data transfers at public charging stations known as "juice jacking."</li><li>Juice jacking uses USB charging ports to install malware, run unauthorized commands, or steal data.</li><li>Android 15's Lockdown mode will completely disable USB data transfer while still allowing charging.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is adding a new feature to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> that works to block shady data transfers at public charging stations.</p><p>Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-lockdown-mode-changes-3450855/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, has found a new security feature for Lockdown mode in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-2-private-spaces-nfc-fixes">latest Android 15 beta</a>. This feature protects your device from a sneaky hacker tactic called "juice jacking," which takes advantage of USB charging cables to sneak in malware, run unauthorized commands, install unwanted apps, or mess with your data.</p><p>Juice jacking is a hidden risk that came to life due to the widespread availability of USB charging ports. This cyberattack exploits the phone&apos;s single port for power and data transfer. Using a compromised public station can open the door for hackers to install malware, steal personal data, or take full control of your phone.</p><p>While Rahman recognizes the risks of juice jacking, he also points out the current security measures that help mitigate these threats. For instance, Android&apos;s default settings already block USB Debugging until the device is unlocked. Plus, accessing device files requires switching to file transfer mode. These built-in safeguards create a strong defense against unauthorized ADB commands or attempts to access your files.</p><p>However, Rahman admits that a perfectly executed juice jacking attack could seriously compromise your device. To combat this, Android 15 is introducing a significant upgrade to Lockdown mode. This new feature completely disables USB data transfer while still allowing charging. This means you can charge your phone at public stations without worrying about your data being at risk.</p><p>To enable this protection, just hold down the power button and select "Lockdown" from the Power menu (if your settings allow it). One tap activates a digital shield around your data.</p><p>Rahman tested the feature on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review">Pixel 6 Pro</a> and another device running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. The verdict was clear: Android 15 cuts off all USB data transfers when Lockdown is activated.</p><p>Pixel users with compatible models can look forward to this feature with the official Android 15 update. Users of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> might have to wait a bit longer, as it will be up to individual manufacturers to update their USB Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to support the new Lockdown mode APIs.</p><p>Even though the odds of a juice-jacking attack are slim, Android 15&apos;s upgraded Lockdown mode provides an extra layer of security for cautious users. Public charging worries can be a thing of the past.</p>

Apple&apos;s annual WWDC conference happens in early June, and inevitably, we write about all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">features Apple stole from Android</a>. It&apos;s a fun and mostly tongue-in-cheek affair, as we know that competition is good for everyone and good ideas are best spread around rather than locked behind a proverbial cage with only one key to unlock them.</p><p>That&apos;s part of why Apple adopting RCS is such a big deal, even if the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-made-rcs-messaging-an-afterthought-at-wwdc-why-wouldnt-it">doesn&apos;t want to do it</a>. But this year, it wasn&apos;t just iOS copying features from our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android phones</a>. Rather, we saw Apple copying some of the best Quest 3 features for its significantly more expensive Apple Vision Pro headset.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple isn&apos;t the only one copying things. Just as Google pulls ideas from Apple&apos;s small stock of unique and excellent features—many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">best Google Messages features</a> were ripped right from iMessage, after all—Meta is also grabbing great ideas from Apple&apos;s first mixed reality headset.</p><p>Given the relatively nascent nature of standalone VR — that means a headset that works on its own without being plugged into a PC, console, or smartphone — it makes sense to see ideas grow so quickly and companies one-upping each other every single month. I always say competition is good for everyone, and the battle between the Apple Vision Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> proves that point.</p>

<p>You&apos;ve probably heard it said before that current VR/mixed reality/spatial computing headsets are still in the early smartphone era. Some even called the Vision Pro the "iPhone of VR," alluding to its revolutionary hand and eye-tracking-driven UI. In some ways, it is, but Apple&apos;s latest update shows that one company doesn&apos;t yet hold all the keys to success.</p><p>Case in point: Apple added a brand new home gesture where you pinch your index finger and thumb together to go home. Functionally, it&apos;s identical to swiping up from the bottom of your phone to go to your home screen. Ironically, Meta added this <em>exact</em> same gesture to Meta Quest headsets back in February, around the time the Vision Pro first launched.</p><p>See for yourself how it works on each headset:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.67%;"><img id="GGG8DXWB2ENkzbCu4niywf" name="vision-pro-quest-3-pinch-gesture.gif" alt="Showing how the pinch gesture is identical on Meta Quest 3 vs Apple Vision Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GGG8DXWB2ENkzbCu4niywf.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="340" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While we could whine about how Apple stole Meta&apos;s idea or some such nonsense, the reality is that this gesture <em>makes sense</em>.<em> </em>It&apos;s something that works every single time and feels good to use. Apple also implemented another gesture that works by rotating your hand around—palm down—then pinching and dragging to adjust the volume.</p><p>Apple also borrowed several ideas Meta already implemented, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-keyboard-and-mouse-oculus-quest-2">support for Bluetooth mice</a> and more keyboards, guest and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-multiple-accounts-and-app-sharing-quest-2">secondary profiles</a>, and even those handy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-live-captions-on-your-android-phone">live captions</a> that come with every Android phone. Likewise, Meta&apos;s latest updates include handy Vision Pro features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-travel-mode-launch">travel mode</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v65-update-adds-panoramas-ignores-android">spatial videos from iPhones</a>.</p>
<p>On the smartphone side of things, companies have learned over the years that people naturally gravitate to certain behaviors based on what&apos;s happening on their phone&apos;s screen. Swiping in from the side makes sense to go back, and swiping up from the bottom makes sense to go home. These gestures have been adopted on nearly every phone in existence at this point and it&apos;s because they work in a strangely natural way for most users.</p><p>Likewise, we&apos;re already seeing some UI paradigms take root in the heads of VR power users who regularly swap between headsets. One popular streamer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThrillSeekerVR">ThrillSeeker</a>, who has over 700,000 subscribers on YouTube and uses a plethora of different headsets, has already found himself wanting Apple&apos;s brilliant Control Center in every VR headset he uses.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I find it very interesting that I have significantly more hours in Quest OS and various SteamVR headsets from years of VR usage and muscle memory- yet after only 3 months of Vision Pro I instinctively look up for control center in every single headset.It’s a surprisingly… https://t.co/bWWDoCCICH<a href="https://twitter.com/Thrilluwu/status/1798775668601229503">June 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Despite putting over an estimated 10,000 into using other VR headsets, Thrill says roughly 200 hours of Vision Pro usage has reprogrammed his brain to expect certain UI paradigms.</p><p>Another YouTuber and VR analyst, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1798079364493701169">Brad Lynch</a>, feels the same way about Apple&apos;s gaze-and-pinch UI. "Every time I put a HMD on, including Quests, SteamVR, etc., I instinctively try to gaze and pinch to interact with things."</p><p>If you&apos;re not already aware, the Apple Vision Pro uses eye-tracking inside the headset in combination with hand tracking to navigate its UI. To select something, you merely gaze at it with your eyes and pinch your finger to "click."</p><p>Many of us assumed this feeling would arise after using Vision Pro for long enough, but it&apos;s another thing to see it play out this way.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-next-2">What&apos;s next?</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vk6uTYOINY4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>We&apos;re already aware that Meta is working to give the Meta Quest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-first-details">a UI overhaul</a>—an update that&apos;s expected later this year—and the company looks to be doing it by not just copying Apple but by introducing other new paradigms that we&apos;ll soon come to expect from all VR headsets.</p><p>One new thing I&apos;m particularly looking forward to is in-headset smart home control. Instead of pulling out my phone or yelling across the room for Google to do it—knowing that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> probably won&apos;t do the right thing anyway—I&apos;ll just point to the light and tap it virtually to turn it on or off.</p><p>I fully expect this kind of natural UI paradigm to become more and more prolific as full-fledged AR glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">the upcoming Meta ones</a> become mainstream. The lack of sleek hardware is holding that vision back a bit, but companies like Meta can continue experimenting with new ideas on mixed reality headsets today, later translating those to successful UI designs in future products down the road.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jr4y3C7KyMYpCzN5zXPHSZ" name="apple-vision-pro-barcode-scanning.jpg" alt="Scanning a barcode with the Apple Vision Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jr4y3C7KyMYpCzN5zXPHSZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 is powerful, but it can never fully replicate Apple&apos;s vision-gazing UI because it lacks eye-tracking. That&apos;s OK, though, as Meta can still adopt other important UI designs.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-mysterious-new-ui-ad">A mysterious new ad</a> showcased what we can only assume is part of the new UI design, allowing users to place windows anywhere they want in space. One of the new VisionOS 2 updates gave the Vision Pro the ability to remember window placement between reboots, so you can <em>permanently</em> place a giant monitor on your wall or your Discord chats on your desk, and the headset won&apos;t forget that.</p><p>Apple also introduced barcode scanning in VisionOS 2, as seen in the image above, something that <em>just makes sense</em> when you look at a product through a device like this.</p><p>It&apos;s these kinds of paradigm changes that will continue to make XR and spatial user interfaces feel more natural and unique. They&apos;re the thing that&apos;ll begin changing the dialog from "I can just do this on my smartphone" to "I don&apos;t want to, or can&apos;t do this, anywhere else."</p><p>Until then, though, I hope both companies keep ping-ponging off each other&apos;s ideas because this is good for everyone.</p>

<p>Is Samsung&apos;s new Fan Edition watch good enough for you? Our Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Galaxy Watch 6 guide will run through every main difference to help you decide.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch FE is, in many ways, a re-released Galaxy Watch 4. Typically, Fan Edition devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a> are minor downgrades on their flagship siblings but with distinct designs. The Galaxy Watch FE isn&apos;t <em>identical</em> to the 2021 smartwatch, but it&apos;s close.</p><p>Does that mean you should skip the Galaxy Watch FE and simply buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, which you can frequently find on sale? It&apos;s a fair argument, but we&apos;ll try to give the Fan Edition watch its fair shake and explain why "fans" might want to buy one—or wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Galaxy Watch 6: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x8AQawpZvtt35eSvPUXrYL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-vs-5-side-bezels-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the size and bezels between the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x8AQawpZvtt35eSvPUXrYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 6 (left) and Watch 5 (right); the Watch FE display will look comparable to the GW5's. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch FE matches the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> with its dimensions (40.4 x 39.3 x 9.8mm), 1.2-inch display size, and 330 pixels per inch (ppi). Unlike these models, which had a second 1.4-inch option, the Galaxy Watch FE has no size upgrade.</p><p>For comparison, the Galaxy Watch 6 has the same 330ppi resolution but a smaller display border, so it starts with a 1.3-inch display that hits 2,000 nits of brightness—plus a 1.5-inch model. Samsung didn&apos;t specify, but you can safely assume the Galaxy Watch FE hits 1,000 nits like past-generation watches.</p><p>While the Watch 6 weighs 2.8g more than the Watch FE—probably thanks to a more advanced biosensor—it measures 0.8mm thinner. Somehow, Samsung has prioritized a more compact design with its latest watch. That, combined with the skinnier bezel, will make the Galaxy Watch 6 look slightly better.</p><p>[A quick side note: Both the Galaxy Watch 6 and FE are thicker than Samsung claims; it always measures without accounting for the sensor array. In truth, the Galaxy Watch 6 is about 12mm thick, while the Watch FE should be about 13mm thick.]</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 came in four colors; the Watch FE has three of the same colors (Black, Pink Gold, and Silver), missing out on Green. It&apos;ll also have new watch bands with "distinct blue and orange stitching," plus a "one-click band" for swapping the default option out for your own 20mm band.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3ajJNn5VEYFrYQzyyh87eb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-thickness.jpeg" alt="View from the side of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, showing its thickness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ajJNn5VEYFrYQzyyh87eb.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Watch 6 is slightly skinnier than the Watch FE </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The primary Fan Edition design upgrade is to the display: it has Sapphire Glass like the Galaxy Watch 6 and 5 instead of Gorilla Glass DX+ for the Galaxy Watch 4. That makes it better protected against scratches. Otherwise, all recent Galaxy Watches are fully dust and water-resistant.</p><p>Samsung says the Galaxy Watch FE passed the MIL-STD-810G testing standard for protection—the same as the Galaxy Watch 4—whereas the Galaxy Watch 6 passed the newer MIL-STD-810H standard. We wouldn&apos;t necessarily call the Galaxy Watch 6 "rugged," but it may be slightly more resistant to shock or extreme temperature conditions.</p><p>More generally, both watches have Samsung&apos;s trademark digital bezel, which lets you rotate your finger around the display to scroll through Tiles. Even though the Watch 6 has a smaller display border, it shouldn&apos;t affect the quality of the experience. Instead, the Watch FE could be slightly less reliable because it has an older Exynos chipset, which means a longer response time. </p><p>Only the Galaxy Watch 6 has a "Classic" upgrade with a physical rotating bezel. But this watch starts at $399, twice the starting price of the Watch FE. </p>
<h2 id="galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6-xa0-hardware-sensors-and-battery-2">Galaxy Watch FE vs. Galaxy Watch 6: Hardware, sensors, and battery</h2>

<p>Samsung gave the Galaxy Watch FE the same last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-unveils-5nm-exynos-chipset-powering-galaxy-watch-4">Exynos W920</a> chip as the Galaxy Watch 4 and 5. The chip in the Galaxy Watch 6 hits a slightly higher clock speed, and the watch has an extra 0.5GB of RAM. </p><p>In my Galaxy Watch 6 review, I noted that the last-gen Exynos felt fast at the time, but the new Exynos and memory boost make "apps open ever-so-slightly faster" and that "things look less jittery because it properly shows the transition as one app leaves the screen and another appears." That&apos;s why using the capacitive bezel is "much easier" on the Watch 6.</p><p>The gap between Exynos chips is <em>much</em> smaller than, say, the gap between Snapdragon 8 generations in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a>. But you&apos;ll notice a difference here, especially after Wear OS updates add new, more demanding features. </p>

<p>Samsung hasn&apos;t made many health sensor upgrades in the past few generations. The Galaxy Watch FE will track heart rate, sleep stages, irregular heart rhythm, blood oxygen, and other passive data. You can actively check your heart health with the ECG or your body composition with the BIA sensor. And Samsung will calculate personalized heart rate zones based on your workout data.</p><p>Only the Galaxy Watch 6 offers body temperature data overnight, which can contribute to sleep data. If you really want that information, the Galaxy Watch FE isn&apos;t the watch for you.</p><p>Samsung hasn&apos;t yet shared the Galaxy Watch FE&apos;s battery life estimate or charging speed. We assume it&apos;ll last about 40 hours out of the box, as the past few generations have. From the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-vs-galaxy-watch-4">Galaxy Watch 4 to 5</a>, Samsung doubled the wireless charging speed from 5W to 10W, cutting the charging time from 2 hours to 75 minutes. We hope the Galaxy Watch FE has the newer standard, but we fear it has the former.</p><p>Either watch lets you pay $50 to upgrade to an LTE cellular version, and both have NFC tap-to-pay, Wi-Fi, and built-in GPS. The Galaxy Watch FE uses an older Bluetooth 5.0 standard instead of 5.3, which can offer better connection stability and requires less power to transfer data. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve run through a ton of minor-but-notable differences between the Galaxy Watch FE and Galaxy Watch 6. So, what&apos;s the point of buying the Galaxy Watch FE?</p><p>For starters, it costs $199 to the Galaxy Watch 6&apos;s $299; with LTE, it&apos;ll cost $250 to the Watch 6&apos;s $350; unfortunately, the LTE Galaxy Watch FE won&apos;t ship until October.</p><p>Price aside, Samsung typically gives its new watches four OS updates and four years of security updates. Since the Galaxy Watch 4 came out in 2021, it&apos;ll lose support next summer. The Galaxy Watch FE essentially lets you buy that watch and have it last you until the summer of 2028 instead, with several more Wear OS upgrades.</p><p>We&apos;ve reached out to Samsung to confirm that the Galaxy Watch FE will get the typical four years of support; it&apos;s difficult to recommend without that guarantee, but we&apos;ll assume it for now.</p><p>Samsung promises that the Galaxy Watch FE will have "customizable new watch faces."</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 has several upgrades over the Galaxy Watch FE: a brighter display with a smaller border, a faster CPU with more RAM, a temperature sensor, a thinner design, better Bluetooth connectivity, and upgrade options with larger displays or Classic design. It&apos;s easily the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> available today.</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch FE has nearly all of the same sensors, has the same Sapphire Glass and IP68 protection, weighs slightly less, and (we assume) four years of Wear OS updates. It&apos;s not the <em>worst</em> compromise for a $199 watch, and technically, a new Galaxy Watch FE would have more software support than the Galaxy Watch 6 since that came out last year.</p><p>Samsung is releasing the Galaxy Watch FE now so that the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 and rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra</a> don&apos;t steal its thunder. You may want to wait until Galaxy Unpacked to check what this new generation brings to the table since the Watch FE is based on hardware that will be four years out of date by that point.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 13) Samsung announced the launch of its new, budget Galaxy Watch FE smartwatch packed with an advanced sensor for $199.99.</p><p>The company states in a press release that the Galaxy Watch FE is "stylish and durable" but packs those health monitoring features consumers need. The new watch is available in one size, 40mm, with a 1.2-inch Super AMOLED display. Samsung states the Galaxy Watch FE features a "one-click band" that lets users quickly swap out bands with other colors or one to match their outfits.</p><p>For durability, the device features Sapphire Crystal Glass, which boasts protection against scratches during daily use.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch FE&apos;s BioActive Sensor, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, is said to help users keep tabs on their health and fitness data. The company states the sensor will deliver "actionable" tips for the user&apos;s well-being. Regarding heart health, the post adds that the device features an HR Alert to notify users if their heart rate is abnormally high or low. </p><p>Additionally, the Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification (IHRN) helps to clue users into potential signs of Afib. There&apos;s also the option to perform a quick ECG.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch FE brings in sleep pattern monitoring, sleep coaching, and tips to create a sleep-friendly environment for a better night&apos;s rest.</p><p>There are over 100 workouts available to owners of the Galaxy Watch FE. Runners are being treated to a deep analysis, detailing their performance, insights, and guidance to avoid future injuries. The Personalized Heart Rate Zone helps users hit their stride while Body Composition highlights body and fitness data to help your personal progress goals.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">budget Android smartwatch</a> pairs perfectly with your Galaxy phone through "Find My Phone." Relocation purposes are swift through this feature, alongside the ability to control your phone&apos;s camera via the "Camera Controller." The Galaxy Watch FE lets users switch camera modes and change its angle or zoom.</p><p>The device also supports Samsung Wallet for easy contactless payment on your wrist with access to important cards like your driver&apos;s license.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s latest smartwatch features a 247mAh battery powered by One UI 5 Watch. Internally, it&apos;s powered by the Exynos W920 Dual Core chip with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GM of storage.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch FE&apos;s Bluetooth version will hit the market on June 24, and its LTE variant will arrive later this year but Samsung didn&apos;t specify exact timing. The device will be available in black, pink gold, and silver. Consumers can grab the Bluetooth Watch FE for $199.99, with its LTE variant set for a $249.99 price tag later this year.</p>
<p><em>A previous version of this article noted that the Galaxy Watch FE LTE variant would arrive in October. Samsung has since changed that timing to "later this year." The article has been updated to reflect the change.</em></p>
