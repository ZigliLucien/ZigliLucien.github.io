<ul><li>Samsung might bring its first Fan Edition smartwatch before the Galaxy Watch 7 series.</li><li>The smartwatch will get a launch date sooner than June 24 ahead of the Unpacked event.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch FE was also spotted in an Amazon listing, which confirms the earlier leaked specs and pricing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Galaxy Watch FE is turning out to be another interesting product in the Samsung products portfolio, which has been in the news lately. While it has been rumored to launch alongside the upcoming Galaxy foldables, new info suggests that the release might be sooner.</p><p>According to reliable tipster Arsène Lupin on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-fe-release-date-price-leaks/">SamMobile</a>), the Galaxy Watch FE is heading for a June 24 launch right before the anticipated<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor"> July Unpacked event</a> where we will be witnessing the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Z Flip 6, next to the Galaxy Watch 7 series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Watch FE will release June 24th<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1799064847210119471">June 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, another Amazon Italy listing spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-pricing-leaked-via-amazon/">YTECHB</a> has revealed the smartwatch’s pricing, which is set at €199 (~$215).  The pricing affirms that it falls under the cheaper smartwatch segment or an entry-level Galaxy Watch, as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> will likely be priced at $299, considering the predecessor Galaxy Watch 6’s launch last year.</p><p>Interestingly, in the U.S., the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is available at $239 on Samsung&apos;s website, and the upcoming Watch FE is likely to be priced at around $200. It will be interesting to see what customers might lean into, considering that Watch 6 will have more features than the upcoming Fan Edition since it will be a toned version of the former.</p>

<p>Donna asks:</p><p><em><strong>I asked about buying a charger for my Galaxy phone that could charge it faster and some people were saying that fast charging was bad for the phone battery. If it is then why do companies use it?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you.</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Donna! That&apos;s a really good question because it says a lot about our "disposable" tech life. Because I like to front-load the answer so we can talk more about it, I&apos;ll say it like this:</p><p>Yes, any type of fast charging will diminish the lifespan of your phone&apos;s battery. But we shouldn&apos;t worry about it. The benefits will outweigh any issues for almost everyone. Here&apos;s why.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="wZBxNnvfBAAfW4HpCZi4JG" name="motorola-edge-battery-life.jpeg" alt="Motorola Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZBxNnvfBAAfW4HpCZi4JG.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We need to start by talking about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery&apos;s lifespan</a>. I don&apos;t mean how long it lasts before you need to charge your phone again, but how long it will live before it gets so bad you need to replace it or buy a new phone.</p><p>Your phone&apos;s battery life is measured in what manufacturers call charge cycles. You&apos;ve used a charge cycle if you charge your battery from 0% to 100%, and most phone battery life is between 400 and 500 cycles.</p><p>Note that your phone battery won&apos;t really charge to 100% and will only hit 0% if you leave it off for a long time. There isn&apos;t enough measurable difference to matter, though, so relying on the numbers you see on your phone is good enough.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you charge your phone well before it reaches a low enough charge so it turns off. Sometimes, we can&apos;t wait to charge it to full and stop charging before it reaches 100%. This still counts against the rated lifespan, and if you could do all the math to turn several partial charges into a full cycle, you&apos;ll see issues when you hit about 500 of them.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean your battery stops working once you&apos;ve hit the magic number. It means your battery won&apos;t be able to charge as much and will discharge faster. You can imagine that charge cycle 501 is like charging your battery to 95%, but it reads 100%. Also note that these numbers are estimated, and your battery may be affected a little sooner or might be good a little longer. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wMgPZw9mQWDKayRkqPXzsi" name="samsung-45w-fast-charger_0.jpg" alt="Samsung 45w Fast Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMgPZw9mQWDKayRkqPXzsi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Eventually, your battery capacity will be affected enough to notice. You will have to charge more often, and the situation will get worse and worse. You will either need to have the battery replaced or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">buy a new phone</a> to get things back to how they were.</p><p>Batteries, even rechargeable lithium batteries like the ones used in phones, are disposable. When mobile phones first showed up, they all had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-removable-battery">removable batteries</a> you could change yourself, but now almost every phone has a sealed battery that requires you to take things apart to change them. Phone batteries have come a long way, too, and most people will end up getting a new phone before they need to replace the battery.</p>
<p>Heat will affect the number of charge cycles a battery lasts. Heat is a by-product of charging a battery, and the hotter it gets and how often it gets hot, the shorter its lifespan will be. This is where fast charging will affect things.</p><p>Fast charging moves enough energy that it <em>does</em> create more heat than using a slower method of charging a battery. However, safeguards are in place to minimize the effect it will have.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3561px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mPf8nsFYxrX95AGb75dCFF" name="RedMagic-DAO-150W-GaN-Charger-7.jpg" alt="RedMagic DAO 150W GaN Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPf8nsFYxrX95AGb75dCFF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3561" height="2003" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you fast charge a phone, it doesn&apos;t run full blast all the time. Circuits inside the phone and the charger communicate so that charging speed is ramped up until a certain point is reached, then everything slows down to keep the heat from getting out of hand. If the phone battery gets too hot at any time, the charging speed also slows. </p><p>These safeguards mean that fast charging will have a minimal effect on your battery&apos;s actual lifespan but will still work to get your phone from a low-battery state to one where there is enough charge to use it.</p>
<p>While fast charging does technically lower the life of your battery, it isn&apos;t going to have a practical effect. As long as you use an approved charger and cable and don&apos;t do something silly like put your phone under a blanket, it will be fine.</p>

<ul><li>The June security patch has been spotted rolling out to Galaxy S24 devices under the Verizon cellular network in the U.S.</li><li>The patch is lackluster, only offering your typical "security improvements" for the S24 trio alongside the Galaxy S23 series in the U.S.</li><li>We're awaiting the larger Galaxy S24 Ultra camera patch, which might arrive in June or July to solve HDR and telephoto problems.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s U.S.-based Galaxy S24 series devices have been spotted picking up the latest June security patch.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-june-2024-update-available-for-download/">SamMobile</a>, users in the U.S. under the Verizon Wireless cellular network have started receiving the June patch. Users should begin downloading and installing version <strong>S928USQS2AXE4</strong> as the week continues. Verizon&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-update/">changelog</a> didn&apos;t detail much excitement with the June patch aside from your typical "security improvements."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Samsung</a>, its June patch contains 37 "High" priority fixes. One fix involves Samsung Dialer, which rectifies an issue that could&apos;ve allowed an attacker to place a phone call without "proper permission." Other fixes involve stopping attackers from accessing a Galaxy device&apos;s memory.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-06-01">Google detailed</a> its part in the June security update, offering insight into 12 Framework fixes and seven System fixes.</p><p>The publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s23-plus-ultra-june-2024-security-update-usa/">also spotted</a> the Galaxy S23 series picking up the June security patch marked as version <strong>S91xUSQS3CXE3</strong>. The update is rolling out for the S23, S23 Plus, and the S23 Plus in the U.S. on T-Mobile and US Cellular.</p><p>While carrier-locked Galaxy S24s and S23s are the first to receive the patch, other networks and unlocked devices are likely to follow. The update was spotted early today (June 10), so users should exercise patience as it makes its rounds throughout the week.</p>

<p>We&apos;re still waiting (not so) patiently for the next Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s camera update, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/next-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-upgrade-might-be-on-hold-for-a-bit">has been delayed</a> since April. The patch will likely solve several glitches and problems users have faced with the S24 Ultra&apos;s cameras. Users have continued to report problems with the device&apos;s HDR and telephoto camera&apos;s performance.</p><p>It seems folks will have to wait until June or July for those fixes.</p><p>In other news, the Galaxy S24 series&apos; Instant Slow-mo feature, powered by Galaxy AI, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24s-slow-mo-hdr-boost-confirmed">recently confirmed</a> to pick up some improvements. Slated for One UI 6.1.1, the quirky feature is said to receive support for HDR 10 Plus, which would let users utilize its slow-motion effects in the higher-quality video setting.</p><p>Moreover, the option to quickly share those slowed-down recordings will become easier through the pop-up menu.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm quietly lists Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 on its website without any fuss.</li><li>The positioning of the new SoC appears interesting as it sits between the older Snapdragon 695 and the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1.</li><li>The chipset will likely power the mid-range and budget Android phones this year, as there are two models: one with 5G and the other without 5G.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm launched a new chipset silently, and it showed up on its website over the weekend. The mid-range chipset dubbed Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 has been interestingly launched in two versions: a 5G model and a 4G one.</p><p>The name game with Qualcomm chips has always been confusing, particularly with the non-premium tier models, and so is their positioning. For instance, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-6-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-6s-gen-3-mobile-platform#Overview">Snapdragon 6s Gen 3</a>, which sounds like an upgraded model over the previous Snapdragon 6 Gen 1, is not, in fact, a downgrade (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-6s-gen-3-3449654/">Android Authority</a>).</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> launched in 2022 bore SM650 model number equipped four Cortex A78 cores with clock speeds up to 2.2GHz and four Cortex A55 cores with 1.8GHz clock speeds, aided by Adreno 710 GPU. The latest Snapdragon 6s Gen 3, on the other hand, with SM6375-AC (5G) and SM6370 (4G), equips two Cortex A78 cores with 2.3GHz and six Cortex A55 with 2.0GHz clock speeds, accompanied by Adreno 619 GPU. </p><p>On paper, it looks relatively identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-launches-mid-range-snapdragon-5g-chips">Snapdragon 695</a> from 2021, which came with the SM6375 model and offered similar clock speeds and the same GPU. Interestingly, it was rebranded as a Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 in 2022. While the confusion persists, it is still a new chipset that will likely power the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">mid-range phones</a> this year.</p>
<p>Another notable thing about the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is the inclusion of the Snapdragon X51 5G modem. While both the SM6375-AC (5G) and SM6370 (4G) versions of the SoC incorporate the same 5G modem, it is unclear why Qualcomm chose to bring the 4G version of the chipset by locking the 5G modem. Perhaps the only possible reason appears to be to get the new octa-core CPU tailored for more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a>.</p><p>Android Authority goes on to say that the OEM manufacturers might use the slightly modified Snapdragon 695 with the new Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 label as part of a marketing effort to sell phones that suggest the SoC is entirely new, even though it is a rehashed one.</p>

For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ9SZ6CP"><strong>Amazon is offering the unlocked OnePlus 12R for $50 off</strong></a>, bringing this affordable Android phone down to its lowest price ever. It&apos;s a well-designed phone that isn&apos;t too expensive normally, and with this deal, it&apos;s a pretty good bang for your buck.</p><p>From its well-liked AMOLED display to its battery life and fast charging, buyers often appreciate this phone, and the current price makes the purchase even easier to justify.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> is a great phone for the price, and with $50 off, it's looking even more appealing. It comes with a bright, good-looking 6.78-inch AMOLED screen, with a 120Hz refresh rate. It also charges super quickly in about 35 minutes, and the battery will reliably get you about a day and a half per charge.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 12R also features decent cameras, though some of the auxiliary lenses are slightly lacking.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;re looking for a phone with a particularly good-looking AMOLED display; you want a phone with excellent battery life and fast charging speeds; resistance to dust and water is a selling point for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather go with the OnePlus 12 for more software updates; you want a phone with wireless charging; you&apos;re looking for a phone that will let you run games at higher than 60fps.</p><p>The classic "flagship killer", the OnePlus 12R is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> out there, while still offering great hardware and specs. Between the 6.78-inch AMOLED display, the overall premium-feeling design, and its smooth performance, this phone is pretty impressive at this price point, and that&apos;s just the tip of the iceberg. It also comes with IP65 dust and water resistance, and between 128GB and 256GB of storage. Battery life can consistently reach about a day and a half per charge, and it charges up in just a bit over 30 minutes.</p><p>Don&apos;t expect as many software updates as the OnePlus 12, with the 12R only offering three years of Android OS updates and four years of security updates. While some of the auxiliary cameras aren&apos;t the best, you&apos;ll still get pretty good photo and video quality with the normal lenses under most circumstances.</p><p>All in all, this phone dropping to its lowest price ever is a good deal, and it&apos;s not likely to last long.</p>

<ul><li>An alleged promotional image of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro suggests Samsung will drop its rounded design in favor of a stem, like Apple's AirPods.</li><li>The stem could help with better call quality for users, while other rumors suggest the device will feature a larger battery.</li><li>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro was rumored in February to be joined by a base version as both model numbers were spotted during a software development discovery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest round of leaks involves Samsung&apos;s next-gen earbuds, which seem poised to take on a familiar design choice.</p><p>Known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AsianGeekSquad/status/1800066498259820591">Evan Blass</a> sent a new leaked product render to subscribers of the supposed Galaxy Buds 3 Pro (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/10/galaxy-buds-3-pro-leak-design/">9to5Google</a>). Through the mosaic filter, it seems like Samsung is moving toward an Apple Airpod-like redesign for the Buds 3 Pro. The bud features a long stem, which departs from the company&apos;s rounded design from previous generations, with a wing-tip for stabilization.</p><p>While Samsung appears to be sliding toward Apple&apos;s earbud design language, the publication notes that opting for a stem could help with call quality. Instead of positioning the microphone on the bud&apos;s body (if it were rounded), the company can pop it onto the stem that extends toward your mouth.</p><p>Elsewhere, the device has been rumored to feature a larger battery. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a> features a 58mAh battery in each bud.</p><p>It&apos;s also likely that the Buds 3 Pro will continue to offer touch controls on its body, and hopefully, Samsung will make some improvements. One of the biggest issues we had with the 2022 series was that its touch gestures were a little frustrating to use accurately.</p>

<p>There hasn&apos;t been much to unravel surrounding Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-3-pro-case-spotted-rumors">existence of a base version</a>. In February, the device reportedly appeared during the discovery of its software. The vanilla Buds 3 is rumored to feature model number SM-R530, while its Pro variant sees SM-R630. Samsung was also spotted sending in the series&apos; charging case for certification on home soil.</p><p>Considering that latest rumored redesign for the Buds 3 Pro, it seems we&apos;re in line for a charging case change, too.</p><p>Moreover, considering Samsung&apos;s efforts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-ai-experience-optimized-upcoming-foldable-teased">expand and evolve</a> its Galaxy AI, it&apos;s very likely that the Galaxy Buds 3 series will offer some unique features.</p><p>In other news, a host of renders leaked last week, spilling Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/more-samsung-summer-unpacked-promo-images-leak">summer Unpacked lineup</a>. The pixelated images highlighted the Flip 6, Fold 6, the Galaxy Ring, and the Galaxy Watch 7. These photos came days after Samsung leaked its official promotional images for its next wave of foldables on its Asia-based website.</p><p>We&apos;re not far now as Samsung is expected to debut a wide range of devices on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>The first renders of the Pixel Watch 3 reveal the smartwatch in black.</li><li>The design looks identical to the Pixel Watch 2, including the circular display, rotating crown, and Assistant triggering button.</li><li>However, the smartwatch is likely to be thicker than the previous model, probably due to a bigger battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 series launch is months away, and another exciting product that should be launching alongside them is the Pixel Watch 3. While very little is known about the upcoming smartwatch, the first possible renders have now appeared.</p><p>The high-quality renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> are shared by prolific leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1800123056771510325">Steve Hemmerstoffer</a> (aka OnLeaks) in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-watch-3-first-look-renders-exclusive/">91mobiles</a>. </p><p>At first glance, the smartwatch looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> in terms of design, including the circular display accompanied by a rotatory crown on the side pane. The button to invoke the assistant is also present right next to it. The sensor pane at the rear also appears to be as familiar as the predecessor model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="esAmbBUenWurRsHSpHVagM" name="google-pixel-watch-3-render-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 3 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esAmbBUenWurRsHSpHVagM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest render of the Pixel Watch 3 shows it in a black colorway with the same strap. Since the previous version came in black, silver, gold, and blue variations, similar hues are anticipated for the successor. It wouldn&apos;t be surprising if Google introduced an entirely new colorway, similar to what it did with the Pixel phones.</p><p>The tipster also notes that the Pixel Watch 3 should be a bit thicker than the Pixel Watch 2 while equipping the same 1.2-inch display. As for dimensions, the upcoming smartwatch should measure 40.79 x 40.73 x 14mm, and in comparison, the previous iteration came with 41 x 41 x 12.3mm. </p><p>The thickness here is slightly higher, possibly due to the rumor that the battery is more prominent on the Pixel Watch 3. On the other hand, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-next-pixel-watch-will-reportedly-come-in-bigger-45mm-size">indicated</a> a new 45mm size for the Pixel Watch 3, while the current model only has a 41mm size.</p>

<p>Per the recent Safety Korea and Dekra websites for certification <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-battery-certification-spotted">spotting</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 is intended to sport a 307mAh battery capacity, a tiny bump over the 306mAh battery on the Pixel Watch 2. </p><p>Overall, as we near the WearOS-powered Pixel Watch 3 launch for the fall of this year, the renders indicate design refinements over the predecessor, which has already seen a significant redesign over the first Pixel Watch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is prepping up for its highly anticipated foldable phone launch next month, alongside its flagship smartwatch series. While we await their release, new details emerge indicating the existence of the next flagship Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to have entered the IMEI database way ahead of the launch — likely to happen sometime early in Q5 2025. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/06/exclusive-samsung-is-already-developing-on-galaxy-s25-ultra.html">Android Headlines</a>, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be bearing the <strong>SM-S938U</strong> model number, similar to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> that bore the <strong>SM-S928U</strong> version. The "U" here indicates that the device is designated to the U.S. region like the previous models. </p>

<p>The latest details provided by the publication are some of the concrete information that has come up on the Galaxy S25 models from Samsung thus far. While it confirms the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a>&apos;s existence, something solid about the Galaxy S25 Ultra is yet to be revealed. But thanks to the previous rumors and leaks, we might have a slighter idea of what to expect from the Ultra model alongside the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> models.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fresh-leak-suggests-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-get-a-major-camera-boost">latest leak from late last month</a> has given us the possible camera specs of the Ultra model. The device is expected to equip a quad rear camera configuration featuring a 50MP ultra wide angle lens next to a 200MP primary camera, a 50MP 3x telephoto lens, and another 50MP super-wide 5x telephoto sensor. The latter two will replace the current 10MP and 12MP lenses as seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24</a> models. While the Ultra will still rely on Samsung&apos;s ISOCELL prowess, the standard models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors">rumored to include</a> new Sony imaging sensors.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-design-changes-rumor">expected to use</a> slightly bigger displays than the previous iterations. The flagship trio is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-nano-v2-galaxy-s25-report-claim">likely to gain</a> major AI upgrades from Google, according to Samsung&apos;s executive director of systems, Cho Cheol-min, who recently stated, "We have started discussing how to implement version 2 of Google&apos;s &apos;Gemini Nano&apos; in on-device AI."</p><p>Cheol-min added that Samsung&apos;s team is focused on improving on-device AI on its next Exynos chip, which will be dubbed Exynos 2500. The SoC is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency">rumored</a> to be a powerful 3nm chip powering the flagship trio set to outpace even the Qualcomm next Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 in efficiency.</p>

Whether you want to check the brightness and color of your smart lights, start your robot vacuum, view the feed on your Nest cameras, or even easily connect new Matter smart home appliances, Google Home can do it all.</p><p>Google Home works on any Android or iOS device, although it sports the most features on Android devices because of the deep integration with Google&apos;s operating system. In fact, the Pixel Tablet will give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">the best smart home control experience</a> thanks to its exclusive home control panel, designed to function similarly to a Nest Hub smart display.</p><p>The Google Home app even works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, giving you quick smart home control right from your wrist.

<p>The Google Home app is free to download and use on Android&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app">Google Play Store</a> and the iOS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-home/id680819774">Apple App Store</a>. You will need a valid Google account in order to use it, though, so be sure to have that ready to sign into the app.</p><p>Controlling your smart home through Google Home is simple, but first, you&apos;ll need to set up the app and name your home. When you start the app for the first time, you&apos;ll want to enable notifications via the on-screen prompts. Once you select the Google account you want to use for the app, you&apos;ll be able to allow nearby devices permission and location access.</p><p>Nearby devices permission is optional but it gives the Google Home app the ability to scan for and add new nearby smart home devices, making setup just a button click or two. Gone are the days when you&apos;d need to download a dozen different apps for every smart gome product manufacturer!</p><p>Location access is also optional and, when enabled, will allow the Google Home app to automatically set your smart home devices to "home" or "away" modes, which can come in handy for automatically turning the lights on or off, setting the thermostat to eco mode, and enabling other power-saving automations.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve accepted all the permissions you&apos;re comfortable with, the Google Home app will ask you to name your home for organizational purposes. Each "home" within the app can have its own set of rooms or spaces, allowing you to conveniently organize smart home devices into the physical rooms they&apos;re in. That way, if you ask Google Assistant to "turn on the kitchen lights," Google Home will understand this command and only turn on the lights in the "kitchen" room within the app.</p>

<p>To add a new device, navigate to the <strong>devices</strong> tab at the bottom of the Google Home app, then tap the blue <strong>add button</strong> on the bottom right. From here, select the category of device that best fits the one you&apos;re trying to set up. Matter devices require the least number of steps.</p><p>Using the <strong>works with Google Home</strong> category will require you to select a manufacturer&apos;s service before continuing. Most smart home devices are supported in Google Home, so all you&apos;ll need to do is follow the steps to log in to your account for that device&apos;s manufacturer and link it with your Google account.</p><p>Once you select a device category, choose your home and the room the device will be organized in. The on-screen instructions will guide you through any additional setup that might be required.</p>

<p>The Google Home app&apos;s main tab is the Favorites tab, which displays all your pinned smart home gadgets in a customizable grid. Items in this tab can be added or removed by scrolling to the bottom and tapping the <strong>edit</strong> button. Any item in the list that has a checkmark next to it will automatically appear in the Favorites tab.</p><p>Likewise, tapping the <strong>reorder</strong> button at the bottom of the favorites tab lets you move around each gadget&apos;s tile. I keep my most-used gadgets at the top of the list — my front door lock, living room lights, front yard camera, and thermostat — while other important, but less often used, gadgets are ordered further down the list.</p><p>Many Android phones support using this <strong>device control</strong> pane, as it&apos;s often called, right from the quick settings menu. To find this, pull down on the status at the top of your phone and find the device control button. On Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, this is often in the top row of quick settings buttons.</p><p>Some phones, like Samsung Galaxy phones, may require you to choose Google Home as your smart home control service first. Normally, this is done by opening the aforementioned device control panel, then tapping the <strong>overflow menu</strong> on the top right, followed by tapping edit or another similar option. Samsung often uses Samsung SmartThings as the default service, so you&apos;ll need to change this to Google Home in order to use it.</p>

<p>Any light can be turned on or off by tapping the tile.

<p>Google has substantially overhauled the automations function in recent years, providing an easy way for your smart home devices to control themselves. Whether that means turning lights on and off with a timer, changing your thermostat when you leave home, or locking the door at bedtime is all up to you.</p><p>One of the coolest functions of the Google Home app is the quick home and away modes function, which lets you group common actions together based on whether you&apos;re at home or away from home.</p><p>To get started with this, navigate to the <strong>automations</strong> tab, then tap either <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>Away</strong> to start setting up devices for location-based automation. Google offers suggested starters in each category which will help you quickly decide what options make the most sense. For instance, turning off your indoor cameras, setting the thermostat to a comfortable level, and playing music could all occur when you pull into your driveway.</p><p>Likewise, you may want to enable camera recording, turn on the porch light, and set the thermostat to eco mode when you leave the house. Once you&apos;re done selecting your desired actions, tap the blue <strong>save button</strong> on the bottom right to save either the Home or Away function actions.</p>

<p>Back in the main automations tab, tapping that blue <strong>add button</strong> will let you configure other automations that can occur based on the time of day, if you want to give Google Assistant a specific command, or even by using other smart home devices as a trigger. For instance, ringing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells">favorite video doorbell</a> can trigger anything from lights turning on, video recording, or even music playing to greet the person at your door.</p><p>Some devices, like lights, are nice to turn on and off based on sunrise or sunset. Tapping that <strong>add button</strong>, and then selecting <strong>sunrise or sunset</strong> as the starter action will enable this.</p><p>Otherwise, maybe you&apos;d prefer to start a routine when you go to bed or when it&apos;s time for your kids to take a bath. Selecting <strong>when I say to Google Assistant</strong> as the starter action lets you use any custom command to start a routine, so "bed time" or "bath time" can trigger any number of devices in your home to do something you want to encourage better sleep or quicker bedtime routines.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google made waves when it announced that the Pixel 8 series of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> would support seven years of full OS upgrades last year. Samsung followed up Google’s commitment with a matching seven-year update promise of its own for the Galaxy S24 series earlier this year. More recently, Google extended that seven-year promise to cover the midrange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, proving that great software support can be had on devices at any price point.</p><p>Of course, these commitments were viewed as a massive win for Android — even if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">we aren’t quite sure what Android will look like in 2031</a>. However, we still don’t have a finite gauge of how Google and Samsung’s software commitments stacked up against Apple’s. Until this year, Apple was the clear industry leader in software support with the iPhone and iOS. The uncertainty was cleared up this week, as Apple officially declared how long it would support the iPhone 15 series in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://regulatoryinfo.apple.com/cwt/api/ext/file?fileId=securityTelecommunication%2FiPhone%2015%20Pro%20Max%20%28Model%20A3106%29_V0.pdf" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-software-support-commitment-3449135/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>Apple never publicly stated the software support for iPhones before, making evaluating them tricky. The first two iPhones supported three years of iOS updates, while a few later iPhones supported as many as seven iOS upgrades. That’s a big range that leaves a lot up to Apple’s discretion. However, thanks to the United Kingdom’s new Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure policy, companies now have to disclose a guaranteed software support window for certain products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wNnxn8REnMfcQuoSUX4mHg" name="oneplus-12-vs-iphone-15-pro-max-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wNnxn8REnMfcQuoSUX4mHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In accordance with this new regulation, Apple said that the iPhone 15 series would get a total of five years of software support from the date the phones were first released. For those not keeping track, that’s five years from Sept. 22, 2023. Notably, that means Google and Samsung have guaranteed two more years of software support than Apple, and this is a first. </p><p>Software support matters, regardless of whether you will actually use your new Pixel 8 Pro or Galaxy S24 Ultra for seven years or not. Of course, with software support, you theoretically could do so. If, like most people, you decide to upgrade earlier, you can trade in or sell your old smartphone. Devices currently receiving software updates will fetch more on the resale market than unsupported ones, so phones with longer software support windows will retain their value better. Additionally, if phones can be used for longer, we can reduce E-waste and produce fewer new devices.</p><p>It’s something that should factor into your purchase decision. And for the first time, Android is the one receiving a tick in the win column.</p>
<h2 id="why-apple-is-making-a-commitment-now-2">Why Apple is making a commitment now</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQA6wo7Mpgr6aTuXKm7UX7" name="iphone-15-pro-max-18.jpg" alt="iPhone 15 Pro Max review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQA6wo7Mpgr6aTuXKm7UX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like many of Apple’s recent moves, the company has only decided to outline a software support promise for the iPhone 15 series to comply with regulations. The five-year window is the minimum, and Apple could always extend support beyond this initial guarantee. There is evidence to suggest that the company will support more than that, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/" target="_blank">Statista’s</a> tracking of iPhones and iOS updates. </p><p>The last iPhone to support just five iOS versions was the iPhone 6, released in 2014. All the iPhones released since have received either six or seven iOS versions, though the jury is still out on some of the newer models. It’s possible that Apple is anticipating on-device AI processing becoming a huge part of iOS, which would restrict what kinds of hardware can run newer iOS versions. Or, in the more likely scenario, Apple is just declaring a minimum number, and it plans to offer more support than it has agreed to. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P2e3jF6T5NDwd9vSwinXWb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-vs-Google-Pixel-8-Pro-display-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2e3jF6T5NDwd9vSwinXWb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, we shouldn’t give Apple a pass just because it <em>could</em> offer more support to the iPhone 15. As it stands now, the newest Android phones are guaranteed to get more full OS upgrades than the newest iPhones. That’s true regardless of how these promises and support windows end up playing out. Android manufacturers, specifically Samsung and Google, deserve credit for solving what was a major problem for the platform in previous years. </p><p>It was a common notion that iPhones inherently lasted longer than Android phones, and this situation has been completely flipped. At present, Pixel and Galaxy devices are guaranteed to receive more software support than iPhones, helping them last longer. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-no-longer-fix-samsung-phones-at-best-buy">Samsung has some serious repairability problems</a> that could limit how long Galaxy phones can feasibly last, but Google is doing great on that front. Combined, it’s definitely possible that a Pixel phone can last longer than a new iPhone with great hardware and software support.</p>
<h2 id="it-x2019-s-still-on-android-phone-brands-to-prove-it-2">It’s still on Android phone brands to prove it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AxWTrfRYJAJ7DLJEZoxu5g" name="android-15-home.jpg" alt="Android 15 home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AxWTrfRYJAJ7DLJEZoxu5g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there is one thing to remember when we discuss the software support windows promised by companies — they actually have to deliver on these promises. The work isn’t done yet; in fact, the opposite is true. If the version of Android released seven years from now runs like garbage on Pixel 8 series phones, this support promise will be seen as nothing more than a marketing tactic. Other Android Central staffers and I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-8-8a-receiving-gemini-nano-soon-should-make-you-skeptical-about-update-promise">expressed skepticism over the Pixel 8 update guarantee</a>, and we aren’t the only ones. </p><p>Samsung and Google still have to prove that they can support phones for seven years. But for now, it’s worth giving a tip of the cap to Android brands that have managed to usurp Apple in software support for the first time.</p>
