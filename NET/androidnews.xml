                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When you have the opportunity to mess around with and use a bunch of Chromebooks, it doesn't take much for your eyes to basically glaze over. Every once in a while, something comes along that grabs (and keeps) your attention, and that's exactly what the Galaxy Chromebook Plus has managed to do.</p><p>Samsung's first foray into Chromebooks since 2022 arrived in early October, and I haven't been able to put it down. Thanks to some lingering Black Friday and early Cyber Monday deals, you too can enjoy the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/galaxy-chromebook-plus/buy/galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-intel-core-3-256gb-neptune-blue-xe550xga-kc1us/"><strong>all it will take is $100 and an old device</strong></a>.</p><p>I didn't expect to see Samsung offer any sort of discount for a device that's barely two months old. Let alone being able to get one for just $100. Yet, here we are, and this incredible deal is still kicking.</p>

<p>After being fortunate enough to get some hands-on time with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus in New York, I couldn't wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">chance to review</a> it. I've been using it practically every day since it arrived on my doorstep, with the exception being when I've been testing out other devices.</p><p>The first thing that will draw you in is the design, which is something that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise if you've used Samsung devices in the past. It's sleek and premium, and the "Neptune Blue" looks simply incredible. Not to mention that this is the thinnest and lightest Chromebook Plus model on the market.</p>

<p>When you open the lid for the first time, you're greeted with a stunning 15.6-inch AMOLED panel, which might just be the best I've seen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>. Powering this entire ensemble is the Intel Core 3 100U processor, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>As a result, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus became an immediate contender for best Chromebook. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/black-friday-chromebook-deals-2024-score-major-savings-on-acer-lenovo-samsung-and-more">early Cyber Monday deals</a> rolling in, now's your chance to save big. Just head over to the Samsung website, and make sure you follow the steps in the "Samsung Trade-in" section to knock the price down to $99.</p>

<p>Walmart Plus members will get access to the Cyber Monday deals at 5pm EST on December 1st, hours before everyone else.

The discounts will continue until midnight EST on Monday, December 2nd. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-cyber-monday-2">When is Cyber Monday?</h2>
<p>Cyber Monday is traditionally the Monday after Black Friday. The event was first launched by retailers as an attempt to encourage customers to shop online. The plan apparently worked, as Cyber Monday is now considered to be one of the biggest sale events of the year. </p>
<h2 id="does-cyber-monday-have-better-deals-than-black-friday-2">Does Cyber Monday have better deals than Black Friday?</h2>
<p>Black Friday typically has better deals than Cyber Monday, but many retailers will extend their offerings (or launch entirely new deals) in preparation for the event. Cyber Monday is also known for being a great time to make smaller purchases in the wake of Black Friday. </p>

This is because I'm a big believer in having as much RAM and storage as possible and having 8GB versus 4GB of RAM will pay dividends in both the short, and long term.</p>

<p>Lenovo last refreshed its Chromebook Duet lineup back in 2022, and many of us were hoping that a new version was on the way. The company answered those prayers with the Chromebook Duet 11, refining it even further, and easily making one of the best Chromebooks out there.</p><p>With the Duet 11, you'll get a beautiful 11-inch display, with a resolution of 1920 x 1200, which is also capable of reaching up to 400 nits of brightness. Sandwiched between the glass and aluminum is the MediaTek Kompanio 838, which does a fantastic job at being both performant and efficient.</p><p>There's a lot of competition in the space, but part of what has helped the Chromebook Duet stand out is that it includes a detachable keyboard. Much like the tablet, the keyboard cover has also been refined, making for an excellent typing experience.</p><p>On top of all of that, the Duet 11 supports USI 2.0, and as a bonus, Lenovo is including its USI Pen 2 in the box which would set you back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/stylus-pens-and-supplies/pens/4x81q72383">another $45</a>! So when this lands on your doorstep, you'll have everything you need to start using it, without needing to pay more by ordering other accessories.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>'Tis the season for spending time with family, cups of hot cocoa, and wacky Chromebook deals. Seriously, we've seen a lot of crazy Black Friday and Cyber Monday Chromebook deals, but being able to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1400CKA-AS88F/dp/B0CRTJ1LZ4/"><strong>ASUS Chromebook CX1 for $100 off</strong></a> might just be the craziest of them all.</p><p>At first glance, saving $100 on a Chromebook probably seems as though it's "par for the course," and you'd be right. But when you consider that the Chromebook CX1 is already one of the best cheap Chromebooks for under $250, that extra $100 is a big deal (pun intended.)</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9d83f40a-835d-4d2c-8f8b-79d8a68d685c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension48="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension25="$109.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1400CKA-AS88F/dp/B0CRTJ1LZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="AuKKcUZe2DY5kDgo2bYdTk" name="asus-chromebook-cx1-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AuKKcUZe2DY5kDgo2bYdTk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There are cheap Chromebooks, and then there are cheap Chromebooks that are good. The ASUS Chromebook CX1 falls into the latter category, and thanks to Amazon's early Cyber Monday deals, you can save $100.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-Chromebook-CX1-14-inch-FHD-Laptop-Intel-Celeron-N4500-4GB-RAM-128GB-eMMC-Silver/6717057798" data-dimension112="9d83f40a-835d-4d2c-8f8b-79d8a68d685c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension48="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension25="$109.99">$159 at Walmart </a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1400CKA-AS88F/dp/B0CRTJ1LZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9d83f40a-835d-4d2c-8f8b-79d8a68d685c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension48="Price comparison: $159 at Walmart" data-dimension25="$109.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>For the unaware, there are actually two versions of the Chromebook CX1, the CX1 (CX1400) and the CX1 (CX1500). The only difference between the two is the screen size, as the CX1400 features a 14-inch display, and the CX1500 adds an inch.</p><p>While both of these are actually on sale as part of Amazon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/black-friday-chromebook-deals-2024-score-major-savings-on-acer-lenovo-samsung-and-more">early Cyber Monday Chromebook deals</a>, we're particularly fond of the CX1400. The smaller display makes for a smaller and lighter Chromebook, which is rather important if you're carrying this around in a bag with you all day. For many, a compact Chromebook wins out more often than not, giving ASUS Chromebook CX1 (CX1400) the nod for us.</p><p>Under the hood, we have the tried and true Intel Celeron N4500 paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. Obviously, this won't win any performance awards, but the N4500 offers enough "oomph" to handle a bit of multitasking. Really, it's the perfect Chromebook for things like writing up and reviewing documents or responding to emails.</p><p>Something else that you'll love is having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> that will last you all day, and then some. Thanks to the lower-end specs, the Chromebook CX1 just sips on battery and is rated to last for up to 12 hours on a single charge. So you can respond to those emails, close the lid for the night, and pick right back up the next morning without worrying about running out of juice.</p><p>As I mentioned before, the 15-inch model is also on sale, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1500CKA-AS84F/dp/B0CRD43GY6"><strong>Amazon currently listing it for $169, a savings of $80</strong></a>. So while it's not as cheap as its smaller counterpart, you're still getting a great deal.</p>

The fitness tracker in question is arguably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbit</a> ever built, with a bounty of comprehensive health and fitness tracking sensors, built-in GPS and NFC, and up to seven days of battery life on a single charge. And thanks to its ultra-slim and lightweight design, you&apos;ll barely notice it&apos;s there (unless you choose the version with the eye-catching red band).</p><p>Will this deal expire along with all of the rest of Best Buy&apos;s Black Friday offerings, or will it be extended into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday</a>? Only time will tell, but I wouldn&apos;t wait to find out.</p>
<h2 id="when-do-the-cyber-monday-sales-start-2">When do the Cyber Monday sales start?</h2>
<p>We&apos;re in that strange transitional period between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Some retailers, like Amazon, are expected to extend their Black Friday deals through the weekend and simply slap a new label on them, while other sites may end their discounts this evening and drop a fresh batch of deals first thing next week. Needless to say, we&apos;ll continue sharing all of the best deals as they go live or expire, so keep checking our site for the latest news.</p>

If you're a Roku fan or are just looking to upgrade your old TV with a fresh suite of new apps, this early Cyber Monday deal makes the Roku Ultra (2024) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Ultra-2024-Streaming-Rechargeable/dp/B0DF44RTTP/"><strong>just $79.99</strong></a> for a limited time.</p><p>I picked up the Roku Ultra (2024) because my 2017 LG OLED was starting to have trouble with streaming apps and was even missing quite a few new services. The Roku Ultra (2024) has every single app and streaming service I could imagine, plus tons of free movies, TV shows, live TV, and more built right in.</p><p>It's also got <em>excellent</em> 4K picture quality with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision HDR support, which made shows like Rings of Power season 2 look even better than they did when I streamed them from my TV's Prime Video app. I could have picked up an Nvidia Shield but that thing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM">is nearly $200</a>! Forget that nonsense.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You've got an aging TV that's getting slow and laggy, or just need a new streaming box that's capable of the best picture quality imaginable.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need native Google Cast support. Roku has all the apps and services you can imagine but it still doesn't support Google Cast.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/switching-from-chromecast-webos-to-roku">I recently wrote</a>, the Roku Ultra (2024)'s one weakness is a lack of Google Cast support. I've still got my old Chromecast hooked up to the TV for those rare times that I need to cast something obscure from my phone, which is annoying but not the end of the world.</p><p>Most phone apps support Roku casting — and many phones will cast to Roku via Miracast or Apple AirPlay — making this less of an issue than it used to be. Still, if Roku could add Google Cast, this would be the ultimate affordable streaming box.</p><p>But the overall experience has been so good that I've mostly forgotten about this small negative. The remote itself is reason enough to upgrade from an old Roku. It's backlit, charges via USB-C, has hands-free voice control, and there's even a button on the right side of the Roku Ultra (2024) that helps you find a lost remote.</p><p>Plus, with Wi-Fi 6 and Ethernet support, you'll never have issues with buffering or lagging again.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want to monitor energy usage of devices throughout your home, or are just looking to be able to add "dumb" devices to your smart home for more automation.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You already have smart devices that allow you to monitor energy usage.</p><p>I primarily use these smart plugs to add remote control functionality and automation of non-smart devices to my smart home. I've got them hooked up to lamps in several rooms, a space heater in my basement office, and occasionally move some around the house to monitor the energy usage of various electronic gadgets.</p><p>Because of it, I've learned that it's cheaper on most winter days to run two larger space heaters in the house than to use my central HVAC unit.</p>

<p>All you need to do is type in what your power company charges per kilowatt-hour (kWh) — you can find this on your power bill — and the Kasa app does the rest. This helped me dwindle my power bill down substantially over the past few months and I now enjoy a little bit of wiggle room I didn't previously have in my budget.</p><p>A 4-pack is plenty if you're just looking to monitor energy usage and identify problem devices — basically anything can be plugged into these smart plugs — but you may want to get a few more if you're planning on leaving them plugged in to provide smart functionality to existing non-smart devices.</p>

It's not because I don't want businesses to make some cash or because I don't want to save money on piddly stuff like cables or wood screws, but because there is always something out there that will somehow worm its way into my brain and make me spend money, I wasn't planning on spending.</p><p>Last time there was a big sale, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-creality-3d-printer-is-usd130-off-and-works-from-my-phone-so-im-buying-it">a 3D printer</a>.

<p>I never like to spend my Saturday time trying to sell anything. Saturday has been my day to just write stuff about things I enjoy or things I think need to be said.

But I do know it's a solid phone that will do everything I need it to do without a stupidly large price.

<p>I've no interest in a phone that's already too big folding out into a phone that's way too damn big, so I'm going to ignore phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> Super Duper or whatever it's called. Work on your phone names, guys. I mean, come on.</p><p>But a phone that folds into a small square is right up my alley. I love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Flip</a>, but since I got a chance to fondle a Moto Razr, I decided that it's what I want. Motorola's Laissez-faire attitude towards support updates has me a little concerned, but I decided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-giving-motorola-another-chance">I want to give them a chance</a> and trust they will do what they promised and be better.</p>
<p>And the Razr (Minus) isn't perfect, either. It still has plastic over the screen and there's a ridge running through the middle when it's open and neither of these is ideal. There are concessions one has to make if one wants a phone that folds over on itself, though.</p><p>What I like about it outweighs what I don't. For starters, the price. I think asking close to $1,000 for a phone should be a crime. I can buy an old truck and a full tank of gas for that kind of money and still have enough left to take the misses to Red Robin for a burger. The Razr, even when it's not on sale, is the price a foldable phone should start at. Make a Plus or Pro or whatever version for the people who want to spend more money, and this is where Motorola gets it right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:828px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.68%;"><img id="CQ9BxCW7NKjCc8z9ZiN8Le" name="Moto-razr-cart" alt="Motorola Razr 2024 in a shopping cart" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CQ9BxCW7NKjCc8z9ZiN8Le.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="828" height="254" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also like having a screen out front to tell me why my phone is yelling at me so I can decide if I care about it or not. If I see a message, I'll probably answer. If it's just an email or a chat message from Slack, then no way, Jose, you can wait until I feel like looking (sorry, not sorry). You can do that with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-make-lock-screen-notifications-less-obtrusive-in-android-15-qpr2">lock screen notifications</a>, but having it on the little screen on the front is just cooler. At least to me, and this is <em>my</em> money we're talking about here.</p><p>Besides that, it folds into a small package that can fit into any pocket. I like that. I don't know why, but I do. Again, my money. Seriously though, if you're in a wheelchair, keeping your phone in a shirt pocket is a godsend. Flipping it shut means it will slip right in there.</p>
<p>I haven't bought it yet. I stuck it in my cart once I saw the sale price with the idea that I'll check it once all this Black Friday/Cyber Monday mess is done and I know how much money I'm willing to spend. Gotta buy them Christmas presents for the grandbabies, you know?</p><p>I know I'm going to end up doing it, even though I might want to kick myself for it. I don't <em>need</em> a phone; I just <em>want</em> this phone.</p>

<ul><li>A leaker with a reliable track record revealed that Nothing has three phones in active development.</li><li>We already know that Nothing is working on a Phone 3, which is slated for release in 2025.</li><li>The other two rumored devices could be a more premium Nothing Phone 3 Pro or Phone 3a, though that is only speculation at the moment.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing decided not to release a new flagship in 2024, instead <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">choosing to focus on developing AI features</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a>, and eventually Phone 3. The move made sense, because the industry leaders — including Apple, Google, and Samsung — have all done the exact same thing. In order to stay competitive, Nothing needs AI, and thus it released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus</a> this year, saving Phone 3 for next.</p><p>That doesn't mean Nothing hasn't been working hard on new devices behind the scenes; in fact, a new leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1862415464820842533" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a> suggests the opposite. Brar reports that Nothing has three phones in active development, but does not go into detail as to what those devices might be. Instead, the leaker predicts that these phones will be ready for release sometime in the first half of 2025.</p><p>This lines up with what we already know about Nothing's plans for Phone 3. The company has said that its next flagship smartphone will debut in 2025, so that leaves two devices unknown. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">Nothing Phone 3 was spotted in a Geekbench database recently</a>, signaling that the company could be prompting for a launch sometime in the first half of next year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are 3 new phones from Nothing under active development right now.

These Will likely cover H1 2025<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1862415464820842533">November 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The current Nothing lineup technically includes three phones, for what it's worth. There's the flagship Nothing Phone 2, the midrange Nothing Phone 2a Plus, and the budget Nothing Phone 2a. However, the Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus are nearly identical, with the latter simply including a faster MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro system-on-a-chip.</p><p>There's reason to believe that Nothing could be favoring the flagship market this year, choosing to release a Phone 3 and a faster Phone 3 Pro. The Nothing Phone 3 Pro may best represent what we're used to from a Nothing flagship, since it is rumored that the standard Phone 3 could include a lowly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> chip. While unconfirmed, a budget Nothing Phone 2a could round out the lineup, accounting for all three devices rumored to be in development.</p><p>It's unclear whether all three rumored devices will launch around the same time, or if these Nothing phones may be staggered throughout 2025. Another thing to watch is the markets the Nothing Phone 3 series will debut in, since prior Nothing phones have had limited or no US availability.</p>

The phone was recently spotted in a leaked video showing off a bit of the device and what looked like One UI 7 running on it. Now, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-exclusive-3503414/">series of images</a> has emerged that reveal more of the device as well as One UI 7.</p><p>As expected, the alleged Galaxy S25 Ultra features a boxier design with more rounded corners and a flat display. We also get a look at the bottom of the phone, which sports the USB-C port, speaker and mic, SIM card slot, and the S Pen tucked into the phone.</p>

This will enable T-Mobile users to utilize Starlink satellites to access basic network capabilities like texting and eventually voice and data. The move was announced as a way to effectively end dead zones.</p><p>The FCC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-1193A1.pdf">says</a> this kind of connectivity will support "critical public interest benefits," which may refer to the recent hurricane that saw many without access to cellular connectivity. In fact, the two companies were granted approval to temporarily provide the service to those affected by the hurricane, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">highlighted the need for this kind of tech</a>.</p><p>The approval has some restrictions that will limit Starlink and T-Mobile's ability to provide voice and other more bandwidth-hungry services, but things are finally getting off the ground with more ubiquitous satellite connectivity services.</p>

This week, both companies presented closing arguments in a final effort to sway the court in their favor.</p><p>“Google is once, twice, three times a monopolist,” Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum told the judge (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/technology/google-advertising-monopoly.html">The New York Times</a>). “These are the markets that make the free and open internet possible.”</p><p>The U.S. government is arguing that Google used its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008 to dominate and push out the competition, as the company now controls 87% of the Ad Tech market. It's said that this has caused websites to potentially lose out on money they could have made selling through rivals, and the result could be that news outlets and websites may be forced to charge consumers to access content.</p><p>Google's lawyer refuted the claims by noting that the company isn't pushing out competition but has reacted in response to competition by innovating its product.</p>
