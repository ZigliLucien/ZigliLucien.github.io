<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>This week (Sept. 16), Apple released iOS 18 on eligible iPhones. With it comes support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>, which has been supported on Android for some time now. As a result, texting between iOS and Android users gets a bit better, with typing indicators, higher-quality media, better group texting, and more.</p><p>Of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">experience isn&apos;t perfect</a>, with features like end-to-end encryption missing (although it&apos;s supported between Android devices), and that&apos;s likely because Apple went with the GMSA version of RCS, which is different from what Google implements on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a>. However, GSMA states it&apos;s working on bringing cross-platform E2EE and other features, which should further improve the texting experience.</p><p>Now, there&apos;s less reason to complain about green bubbles (but you know they will anyway).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NjfzmA4VfvShnnf3nfpMLk" name="Samsung-Rollable-CES-2024-2.jpg" alt="The Samsung Rollable Flex display at CES 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NjfzmA4VfvShnnf3nfpMLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Samsung has shown off rollable concepts before, but the latest rumor suggests the company may finally be ready to bring one to market. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30115">The Elec</a>, Samsung is reportedly switching directions and focusing its efforts on getting the rollable device ready for a launch potentially during the second half of 2024. That puts the device launch roughly around the same time as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">successor</a>.</p><p>There isn&apos;t much known about the device, but it could unfurl to greet users with a 12.4-inch display with an under-display camera.</p><p>According to The Elec, Samsung likely feels some kind of way about Huawei launching the first tri-fold phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">Mate XT</a>. Samsung likely wants to beat everyone else to the rollable finish line (something we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/lg-rollable-hands-on-video">expected from LG years ago</a>).</p>

Well, the company is taking its tech elsewhere and partnering with Google to help develop a new reference platform for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> to utilize Masimo&apos;s biosensing technology.</p><p>According to Masimo, Wear OS OEMs will be free to design their phones however they want, while Masimo will design and test the internal components for health tracking/sensing. This also includes the companion app, although it&apos;s unclear how this will be handled.</p><p>Nonetheless, the partnership should help boost Wear OS health tracking and may even encourage more OEMs to step in and join the platform. Following the recent Apple lawsuit, the timing of the partnership is suspect, but we&apos;re not complaining.</p>

<h2 id="the-quest-3s-could-be-cheaper-than-expected-2">The Quest 3s could be cheaper than expected</h2>

One device we hope to see is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3s</a>, which will likely be a cheaper, more accessible version of the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>. We weren&apos;t sure how much cheaper it would be, but now we may have an idea, thanks to an Amazon leak.</p><p>According to the image, the Meta Quest 3s may start at just $299, which is $200 cheaper than its flagship sibling. The image also shows what the Quest 3s may look like, featuring a similar overall design but with two sets of three individual lenses on the front. We also expect the device to be powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 for better performance, although it will likely feature Fresnel lenses instead of pancake ones, which is likely to keep costs down.</p><p>If this is to be believed, a $299 price point for a newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headset</a> would likely do well, especially ahead of the holidays, for anyone still wanting to get their hands on a Quest VR headset but not wanting to get the older Quest 2.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re not familiar with it, Life360 is a service that tracks people&apos;s movements and the devices you&apos;ve placed in a group. Each member of the group needs to install the app and sign up for the service, so there&apos;s no tracking people without it being obvious.</p><p>The app has plenty of features, especially on the Platinum Membership tier. You&apos;re alerted where each person is through their devices — either a phone with the app or a Tile device — as well as their movements to and from. You can get configurable alerts when someone has left a destination when they&apos;ve arrived, how long it took, and as they&apos;re moving along the way. In addition, you can see when someone&apos;s battery is dangerously low or the last place they were if connectivity is lost and even a notification when a flight has landed.</p>

<p>In my testing, I found everything to work exactly as advertised. If my wife left home to go to the grocery store, I was able to track her progress as well as when she left or if she had to stop for gas. If you take the time to enter friendly names for the locations you frequent, they&apos;re used in the notification so you&apos;ll see a message like "Terry is at Exxon" instead of knowing someone drove for 11 minutes and is at a spot on a map that might not mean much to you.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tile.com/products/new-arrivals">2024 Tile lineup</a>, there&apos;s a new SOS feature through the Life360 app. You can tap the button on a Tile three times and trigger an alert to everyone in your circle or call designated emergency numbers. This too works as advertised, though I did not connect any emergency phone numbers or services. This works in tandem with a crash detection feature to offer peace of mind for a lot of people. This SOS feature is free for all membership tiers.</p><p>Additionally, the new Tile trackers are integrated fully into the Life360 app and it can be used to locate and ring connected devices the same way the standalone Tile app can.</p>
<p>For reference, I&apos;m using Life360 with location permissions allowed on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a>, and my wife is using it the same way on a Pixel 7a. Both of us notice a minimal effect on battery life but no real impact on performance, though there are a lot of notifications if you keep everything enabled.</p><p>My takeaway is that the app works well with the new Tile devices and does everything it&apos;s supposed to do. The permissions it requests make sense, though it does share <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/life360-tiles-new-owner-and-has-been-selling-user-location-data">some personal data</a> with third parties. You&apos;re able to request deletion of all of your data should you wish to do so. These data safety practices will vary based on where you live but this is how it works in the United States.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to a Tile refresh. I still use Tile trackers because they make the most sense for me. I live in Appalachia. It&apos;s peaceful and beautiful here, but you won&apos;t see very many iPhones or new Android phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-embraces-future-ultra-wideband-apis-android">UWB</a>. Google and Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">device tracking solutions</a> may be better than Tile&apos;s in some places, but not here. I have been able to locate a lost wallet because of Tile&apos;s Bluetooth network, so I&apos;ll stick with what works. </p><p>At my house, we use Tile on our keys and wallets and keep one in the car. My wife also has a Tile attached to the strap of her purse, and I have one in the pocket of my laptop bag. We are Tile customers and have been for a while.</p>
<p>As mentioned, I use Tile through the standalone Tile app, not Life360. The new Tile hardware should work well for me, too.</p><p>The Tile Mate, Tile Slim, and Tile Pro have increased their effective range up to 500 feet from a connected phone. That&apos;s half a football field and if you are in an area with plenty of traffic chances are someone using either the Tile app or the Life360 app will come into range on occasion. A larger range means a better chance to find your lost stuff and that&apos;s why you want a device like a Tile.</p><p>The Tile Mate, the Tile Pro, and the Tile Sticker have also had their speakers buffed to be louder than previous models—a lot louder, in my experience. This makes things easier to find, whether they are stuck on the couch or dropped in the bushes.</p><p>Finally, something my wife has been hoping for: the Tile Mate and Tile Slim come in different colors. You can choose from black, blue, green, orange, pink, white, or yellow as well as different combinations of each. For an accessory you will have on your keys or a bag, it makes sense. People will buy a Tile simply because they are colorful.</p>
<p>I like what I see from the new Tile devices. I&apos;m testing a Tile Mate, a Tile Slim, and a Tile Sticker, and again, they do exactly what was expected. I&apos;ll buy a second Tile Mate and a Tile Pro to replace the ones I currently have, and once the battery dies on my Tile Slim, I&apos;ll purchase a new one to replace it.</p><p>One last thing—Tile Stickers work best when stuck to a piece of Velcro so they can be moved to a different device whenever you need to move one. Other wise they are pretty well stuck in place.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MWHtk4hLDb7MPBBreF9dyd" name="Tile-Slim.jpg" alt="Tile Slim" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MWHtk4hLDb7MPBBreF9dyd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the stickler. Many people would consider Life360 to be invasive. Some consider it an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/04/06/sex-traffickers-use-parenting-apps-like-life360-to-spy-on-victims/?sh=7e0a27be64c3">aid in human trafficking</a> or for secret surveillance and predatory.</p><p>Having used the service, I can certainly see how it could be used that way. It&apos;s fairly trivial to secretly install it on someone&apos;s phone, and hiding app icons isn&apos;t difficult. I could install Life360 on someone else&apos;s phone and probably get away with using it while they didn&apos;t know if I had access to their phone for just a few minutes.</p><p>Slightly more concerning, but in the same vein, both Apple and Google&apos;s apps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out" target="_blank">find unknown trackers</a> do not detect a Tile device in your vicinity. Granted, the devices do nothing if not connected to the Tile network through a proper companion app, but I know from experience that plenty of people are part of the Tile network. I could put a Tile Sticker on your car without you knowing it and have a good chance of keeping tabs on your movements with incredible detail.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s the thing: the Life360 app and devices to help you track items and people are useful to a lot of people. Life360 says one of every nine U.S. families uses their service and needs this sort of software. It works well and has minimal effect on your battery which is exactly what a service like this should do.</p><p>These folks aren&apos;t part of a human trafficking network or stalking an ex-girlfriend. When people do these things, it&apos;s not Life360&apos;s fault, and there are plenty of other services out there that will do the same thing even if Life360 goes away.</p><p>I can&apos;t blame a company for the horrible things people do, even if a product it offers makes those horrible things easier. Life360 is not marketing itself as a way to secretly track someone; it bills itself as a way for families to keep tabs on their kids or elderly seniors. It would be really good at it if that sounds like something you need. </p>
<p>I have issues with sharing personal data, and my family is small; no teenagers are driving my car to keep track of, and my mom has a sound mind. Life360 isn&apos;t for me, even though there are a few handy features, such as knowing my wife&apos;s phone went dead while she was out for the afternoon.</p><p>Other families are different and may find it very useful. If you&apos;re looking for an app like this, Life360—especially with the new Tile devices—works very well, and you should have a look at it.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for an app to do anything nefarious, you&apos;ll find one. You can&apos;t blame a company that has done the work to legitimize itself.</p>

Perhaps the Steam Deck is partially to blame for this, but instead of being powered by Windows or SteamOS, there are a bunch of Android gaming handhelds.</p><p>Ayaneo is one of these companies leading the way, taking its experience from Windows handhelds and attempting to make waves in the Android handheld space. The Pocket Air is Ayaneo&apos;s first foray into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handhelds</a>, offering a unique take in more ways than one.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pd8iSnKDxQdpMmWPejydZJ" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-logo-backplate.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Air close-up on backplate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pd8iSnKDxQdpMmWPejydZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ayaneo Pocket Air was originally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocked-air-android-handheld-gaming">announced</a> in August 2023 before it was officially released in September 2023. Initially, it was available through an Indiegogo campaign, coming in a few different configurations. Now, the Pocket Air can be purchased directly from the Ayaneo website.</p><p>When announced, three different configurations were available, starting with the 6GB/128GB model for $299 and maxing out with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Currently, the 8GB/256GB variant has been sold out for some time, but the 12GB/512GB version can be had for $399.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-air-what-i-like"><span>Ayaneo Pocket Air: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="DHdqeTprTWg5rKNT5zzqX3" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-sea-of-stars.jpg" alt="Sea of Stars on Ayaneo Pocket Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DHdqeTprTWg5rKNT5zzqX3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not like the Pocket Air was the first gaming handheld to hit the scene, but something that has helped it stand out is the 5.5-inch OLED display. This, paired with the retro-inspired colorway, makes for an intriguing handheld gaming solution.</p><p>Keeping with the design, there are slight bump-outs on the left and right sides, offering some decent ergonomics. It pales in comparison to the likes of the Steam Deck or Lenovo Legion Go, but at least it&apos;s not another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/pimax-portal-review">Pimax Portal</a> or Nintendo Switch situation.</p><p>Besides that, the Pocket Air has all of the buttons you&apos;d expect from a gaming handheld, with a few extras. First, the two buttons in the bottom right corner operate as shortcuts. The larger of the two activates a panel that slides in from the right, where you can quickly view and change performance or fan profiles on the fly. Meanwhile, the smaller button simply takes you back to AyaSpace, the company&apos;s proprietary launcher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="43kxNDoN9gLh2RbmyBvMdP" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-buttons-thumbstick.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Air close-up on buttons and right thumbstick" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43kxNDoN9gLh2RbmyBvMdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, there are a couple of extra tricks that the Pocket Air has up its sleeve. For one, the power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner, which is great for jumping back into a game quickly without entering a PIN or drawing a pattern.</p>

<p>My favorite "trick" of the Pocket Air comes via the pull-out tray on the bottom. Not only is there a microSD card slot, which is important if you have a massive library of games, but if you flip the pull-out microSD card tray over, you&apos;ll see a cutout for a tiny card. That&apos;s right; you can pop a SIM card into the Pocket Air and play games literally anywhere without being tethered to Wi-Fi.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iA5c4EoarpiWC68kJoCvYN" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-microsd-card.jpg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Air microSD card slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iA5c4EoarpiWC68kJoCvYN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for performance, MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 1200 can handle pretty much anything that you throw at it. This includes the likes of PS2, GameCube, and even some Switch games, especially if you opt for one of the higher-end models that are equipped with more RAM.</p><p>Don&apos;t expect to emulate Tears of the Kingdom here, but for lighter-weight titles, the Dimensity 1200 barely breaks a sweat. It&apos;s also worth pointing out that thanks to the massive fan cutout and active cooling system, I never once felt the Pocket Air get too hot to hold.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-air-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Ayaneo Pocket Air: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="atVRaaXBCdj3tPopQ5BvUd" name="pimax-portal-review-13.jpg" alt="D-Pad comparison between Ayaneo Pocket AIR and Pimax Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atVRaaXBCdj3tPopQ5BvUd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I previously mentioned that it&apos;s possible to emulate Switch games on the Pocket Air. While that is technically true, the Dimensity 1200 just isn&apos;t powerful enough for higher-end Switch titles. Compounding the limitations of MediaTek&apos;s chip is the lack of third-party driver support.</p><p>While MediaTek chips are more affordable compared to Qualcomm, the latter is still preferred due to better community support. MediaTek processors are fairly "locked down" in this regard, making it more difficult for custom drivers to be created that support the various chips.</p><p>Frankly, it&apos;s a bit disappointing to see, especially when you consider that some MediaTek processors outperform Qualcomm equivalents in "raw" power. However, if the power can&apos;t be optimized properly, then those performance differences aren&apos;t available and shouldn&apos;t be included in your decision-making.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PqxrazS3JKRMT8sYGckduQ" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-apotris-gba-pizza-boy-a.jpg" alt="Top-down view of Ayaneo Pocket Air playing Apotris" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqxrazS3JKRMT8sYGckduQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of that being said, there&apos;s a pretty good chance that you aren&apos;t going to try to push the Pocket Air to the absolute limits. However, it&apos;s still something to keep in mind so you better understand what&apos;s possible.</p><p>While it probably won&apos;t be a dealbreaker for those who plan to play retro games, it is disappointing to see the refresh rate capped at 60Hz. At the very least, I think the Pocket Air should have featured a 90Hz refresh rate, even if the company didn&apos;t (or couldn&apos;t) match the likes of the Razer Edge.</p><p>One of the problems with the Pocket Air at launch was that you couldn&apos;t remap on-screen controls to the built-in controller. Thankfully, this has been remedied via subsequent software updates. However, I&apos;m still not the biggest fan of the AyaSpace launcher and interface. Thankfully, there are a few alternatives that work quite well, including ES-DE, Beacon, and Daijisho.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q6AgHp4XKcQjgnN4j8EpYL" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-review-es-de-nintendo-switch.jpg" alt="ES-DE launcher on Ayaneo Pocket Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q6AgHp4XKcQjgnN4j8EpYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I&apos;ve come to find that the D-Pad on the Pocket Air is just a bit too mushy for my taste. It&apos;s almost like the Pocket Air and Pimax Portal are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p>The problem is that with a mushy D-Pad, there have been times when I&apos;m playing Apotris or older Tetris games, and the pieces are one or two slots off from where I was trying to place them. This isn&apos;t an issue during the early levels, but it&apos;s definitely frustrating when the pieces are flying down and one wrong move ends a run prematurely.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-air-the-competition"><span>Ayaneo Pocket Air: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hWfBF4dBBJScbEVpV3QWF5" name="ayn-odin-2-tloz-tears-of-the-kingdom.jpg" alt="Tears of the Kingdom on AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWfBF4dBBJScbEVpV3QWF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It seems that Ayaneo is attempting to take over the Android gaming handheld space, and it all started with the Pocket Air. Since then, the company has announced the Pocket S, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">Pocket DMG and Pocket Micro</a>. However, at this price point, Ayaneo&apos;s stiffest competition comes in the form of the AYN Odin 2 and Odin 2 Mini.</p><p>The Odin 2 and Odin 2 Mini are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>, making it more powerful than the Dimensity 1200. As mentioned previously, this also means that there is better driver support for emulators. Then again, neither the Odin 2 nor Odin 2 Mini are equipped with an OLED display, giving the Pocket Air a pretty clear advantage.</p><p>There&apos;s also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">Pocket S</a>, which was announced last year and is one of a handful of devices to be powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. However, it won&apos;t take long for you to see that the Pocket S offers a more premium design. With that comes a higher price tag, starting at $589 for the base model.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're looking for a good and powerful starter Android gaming handheld. </li><li>You want a handheld with an OLED screen. </li><li>You don't want to spring for a Steam Deck or ROG Ally X.</li><li>You want a handheld with LTE connectivity and expandable storage. </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget.</li><li>You want the most powerful Android gaming handheld.</li></ul>
<p>Ayaneo got a lot of things right with the Pocket Air, as it&apos;s one of a few handhelds that sport an OLED display. Plus, it&apos;s currently one of two handhelds that allow you to use it with a SIM card, with the other being the Razer Edge. However, it seems that the Edge is getting phased out as it&apos;s becoming more difficult to purchase, and a successor has not been announced.</p><p>With that in mind, the Pocket Air is a great entryway into the Android handheld scene, especially for beginners or those who have no interest in higher-end emulation. It&apos;s comfortable to hold and offers great battery life. Even if you aren&apos;t a fan of AyaSpace, you can download a different launcher.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has slapped AT&T with a $13 million fine over a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/atandt-data-breach-affects-9-million-customers">cloud security slip-up that led to a data breach last year</a>, leaving customers’ sensitive personal information exposed to outside parties.</p><p>In 2023, a former AT&T cloud vendor was hacked, exposing the data of 8.9 million customers. The FCC’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-405545A1.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/att-fined-13m-for-data-breach-after-giving-customer-bill-info-to-vendor/" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>) says AT&T didn’t do enough to protect customer information.</p><p>AT&T handed over customer data to the vendor between 2015 and 2017 to create personalized video content. The customer information was supposed to be returned or deleted once it was no longer necessary—something that should have been done long before the breach happened.</p><p>Their contract required AT&T to make sure the data was securely deleted by 2018. However, the vendor held onto the data for years, which eventually led to the 2023 breach.</p><p>The FCC stated that AT&T not only dropped the ball on making sure the vendor safeguarded customer data but also didn’t follow up to ensure it was returned or deleted.</p><p>Luckily, the breached data didn’t include sensitive information like passwords, Social Security numbers, or credit card details. Most of what was exposed related to customer accounts, like billing balances.</p><p>As a condition of the settlement, AT&T has vowed to strengthen its data management practices and set up clear protocols for safeguarding customer information. These improvements are expected to be quite costly, likely exceeding the $13 million fine.</p><p>Although the 2023 data breach was a major event, it wasn&apos;t AT&T&apos;s first run-in with such issues. Last April, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/73-million-atandt-accounts-leaked">had to reset passwords for around 73 million customers</a> after their credentials were found on the dark web. This incident sparked a flurry of class-action lawsuits from affected customers.</p><p>In July, the carrier revealed that a large chunk of its customers&apos; phone and text records <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/atandt-data-breach-compromised-phone-records-of-nearly-all-its-customers">was compromised in a data breach</a> linked to the cloud platform Snowflake. The fallout also affected customers of AT&T-owned networks like Cricket Wireless and other carriers that use AT&T’s infrastructure.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram detailed a new update rolling out today for Reels and Stories that brings a host of new stickers.</li><li>Users will find several classic items of expression packed with attitude alongside details surrounding a game in your DMs that you might not know about.</li><li>Instagram recently added the ability to add a "favorite song" to your profile, as well as Meta AI with "Imagine Me."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s Friday and Meta is rolling out a series of updates for Instagram full of bright colors and fun times.</p><p>Today (Sept 20), Instagram users are advised to prepare for new expressions to hit the social media platform. As detailed in a press release, Instagram is hauling in a total of 38 new stickers for users to utilize when creating Reels and Stories. The major batch of stickers includes the days of the week in stylized, graffiti-like font, hearts with attitude, "W," take an "L," 4K, Sound On, and loads more.</p><p>During your Story or Reel creation, users hopping into the editing room can find these new stickers listed among the rest. Popping in a sticker gives you free reign over its placement, so you can get your point across the right way for the right vibe.</p><p>Instagram says users should begin noticing all 38 new stickers today (Sept 20), though give it some time if you&apos;re not seeing it right away.</p><p>Additionally, Instagram highlights a hidden gem within the app that you might not&apos;ve known was there. You may have heard of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-play-pong-with-emojis-in-this-secret-instagram-game">Emoji Pong</a>" before — and, yes, it&apos;s like the pong you&apos;re familiar with.</p>

<p>The post states users can play the game in a DM with another person. All it takes is for you to tap on an emoji someone sent. The "ball" that you&apos;re playing pong will be whatever emoji it is you&apos;ve tapped. The game&apos;s background will change colors the longer and higher your score rises.</p><p>Instagram will also keep track of your high score at the top right corner.</p><p>Instagram&apos;s latest update in August brought a feature that&apos;ll have you thinking of MySpace (if you know what that is). Users could attach <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-letting-you-share-songs-right-from-your-profile">their favorite song</a> to their Instagram profile within their bio. Those who pay a visit can tap the song and begin listening if they choose. Meta likely avoided the idea of auto-play to avoid any unwanted audio playing on devices.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-imagine-me-selfie-all-platforms">implementing Meta AI</a> into its apps from Instagram to Messenger. The software came with a new feature called "Imagine Me," an AI tool that lets users become whatever they&apos;d like. After completing a series of brief steps, the AI will attempt to generate an image based on your query.</p><p>Meta AI uses your selfie to turn you into things like a DJ or an astronaut.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus were spotted passing through China's 3C for certification, which highlighted charging strength.</li><li>The S25 will seemingly stick with 25W charging while the S25 Plus could see 45W once more.</li><li>Both devices had rumored imagery leaks, showcasing potential design changes, such as a thinner design and a tweaked camera array.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another round of Samsung Galaxy leaks might&apos;ve peeled back the cover on the charging speeds for two of its upcoming models.</p><p>We&apos;re still a ways away from a Samsung Galaxy S launch; however, a database listing spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-s25-plus-charging-speeds-3c/">91Mobiles</a> involves the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-galaxy-s25-plus-45w-charging-speed/">SamMobile</a>). According to the post, Samsung&apos;s base and Plus models appeared in a China Compulsory Certification (3C) for certification, but its listing detailed repetitive charging speeds.</p><p>The former was spotted with 25W wired charging while the Galaxy S25 Plus was listed with 45W.</p><p>The publication&apos;s search also discovered that Samsung may not provide an adapter alongside these devices, which isn&apos;t particularly surprising as many phones from Samsung already don&apos;t ship with power adapters. The folks at SamMobile add that the devices could support USB PD with PPS (Programmable Power Supply) to regulate its charging temperature.</p><p>Samsung has been using the same wired charging speeds for years, and Android Central users found out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/45w-charging-times-disappointing-unfortunately.973233/">as long ago as 2019</a> that Samsung&apos;s "45W" chargers barely charge phones any faster than the 25W ones. At best, these phones charge a few minutes faster with a 45W charger, while competitor&apos;s phones fully <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-battery-charging-speeds">charge in about 30 minutes</a>. Unfortunately, we might be in for the same charging speeds <em>again </em>for another year, but that just means we&apos;ll have to look elsewhere for excitement.</p>

<p>We would say we&apos;re surprised by these rumors — but after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-wont-probably-blow-your-mind-with-its-battery-life">Galaxy S25 Ultra leaks</a>, that wouldn&apos;t make sense. The upcoming Ultra model was rumored to continue to offer a 5,000mAh capacity and 45W charging.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus were recently walking the rumored runway as a series of renders surfaced. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">base model&apos;s image</a>s showed it could offer a near-identical design to its predecessor; however, its vertical camera array could feature all-black rings around the lenses. A 6.2-inch display will likely welcome users like last year, but the phone might be slightly thinner.</p><p>The S25 Plus&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">alleged renderings</a> showed a similar vibe with its rear camera array and the black rings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Samsung could also make the device moderately thinner than its S24 variant, indicative of its shift toward a thin phone era.</p><p>Outside of specs, it seems Samsung is interested in plugging more of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-nano-v2-galaxy-s25-report-claim">Google&apos;s AI software</a> into its Galaxy S25 series. During an interview with Samsung&apos;s executive director of systems, Cho Cheol-min, it was revealed that the two companies were in talks to "evolve" the on-device AI of the S25.</p><p>The talks reportedly mentioned a "Gemini Nano 2" and that it might hit the next flagship trio.</p>

<p>Samsung is tipped to make the Galaxy Ring even more versatile by adding two new size options, 14 and 15, so more people can actually get a ring that fits.</p><p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> made its debut in February with sizes 5 to 13, people with larger fingers were out of luck. But now Samsung is about to roll out more sizes, making the ring more inclusive for everyone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/20/samsung-galaxy-ring-sizes-new-larger-options/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>) if a new tip on X from leaker Max Jambor is to be believed.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Galaxy Ring will be available in two additional sizes, 14 and 15, in the coming weeks pic.twitter.com/00vP18RAKq<a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1837049336821092706">September 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung’s supposed decision to expand the Galaxy Ring’s size range is a smart play to boost its market reach. Since not everyone has the same hand size, this move is bound to make the ring more appealing to a broader crowd.</p><p>According to the tipster, sizes 14 and 15 for the Galaxy Ring might drop in the next few weeks. However, Samsung has not officially announced a release date for these new options.</p><p>If you&apos;re eyeing the Galaxy Ring but unsure about the size, Samsung’s got a handy sizing kit to help. Since the ring&apos;s sensors can make your usual ring size a bit tricky, the kit includes samples of all the available sizes. It’s definitely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-find-the-right-samsung-galaxy-ring-size">worth trying out to find the perfect fit before you buy</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is packed with health-tracking features, letting users keep tabs on their well-being around the clock. We weren&apos;t particularly impressed with the company&apos;s efforts in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring review</a>, but most of the issues are software-related, meaning Samsung could eventually iron them out via updates.</p><p>Even with all its high-tech features, it’s super light, weighing just 2.3 to 3.0 grams, making it comfortable for all-day wear.</p><p>Beyond the size updates, Samsung is also said to be expanding the Galaxy Ring&apos;s reach. Pre-registrations are kicking off in Mexico, and Brazilians can already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/br/samsung-anuncia-galaxy-ring-no-brasil" target="_blank">pre-order</a> the ring, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-availability-expanding-to-more-markets/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>In Brazil, the Galaxy Ring is set to hit the market on October 19, with pre-orders closing a day earlier. However, would-be Mexican customers will have to wait a bit longer for their turn.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring comes in three colors: Titanium Black, Titanium Gold, and Titanium Silver. No matter which size or color you choose, it’s priced at $400 across the board.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors are beginning to surface about the next OnePlus flagship phone and its potential toll on consumers&apos; wallets.</p><p>Rumors alleged by known Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5080346158697790">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) suggest the OnePlus 13 will arrive with 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_13_to_have_an_insane_amount_of_memory-news-64614.php">GSMArena</a>). The tipster states the company&apos;s next phone "is the only one" of the next wave of flagships to feature such a high amount of memory.</p><p>The post adds that the amount of memory will remain consistent "for the whole series." It&apos;s unclear if this is eluding toward the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-oneplus-13r-likely-to-look-different-in-design">OnePlus 13R</a> or not. So, we&apos;ll have to take this particular statement with a grain of salt.</p><p>That&apos;s not all as DCS states this extra RAM option could come at a cost — for the customer. Rumors claim the top configuration of the OnePlus 13 "will be higher this time."</p><p>Unfortunately, DCS doesn&apos;t give a ballpark estimate of what we could expect in terms of price this time. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> launched in January for $799 at its base 12/256GB configuration and at $899 for its max 16/512GB option. A 24GB RAM is typically paired with a 1TB storage buddy. These rumors don&apos;t suggest such a thing; however, it doesn&apos;t stop us from wondering if the OnePlus 13 could push $1,000 considering the recent rumors.</p>

<p>Following rumors of an earlier OnePlus launch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-making-its-debut-way-sooner-than-expected">company&apos;s president recently confirmed</a> that the 13 series will arrive in October. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">Leaked benchmarks</a> show that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 inside the OnePlus 13 achieves astonishing power levels that are higher than even the iPhone 16&apos;s Apple A18 chip. OnePlus president Louis Lee teased the 13&apos;s power, stating it can run Hoyoverse&apos;s Genshin Impact at 120fps </p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-battery-specifications-rumor">leaks claim</a> the OnePlus 13 could give consumers enough power to get them going with a 6,000mAh battery. Those rumors added that the company could chuck in 100W wired fast charging alongside 50W wireless charging strength. The latter was previously rumored to skip the 13; however, rumors are now pulling us in the opposite direction.</p><p>Photography rumors purport the OnePlus 13 could take its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">auxiliary lenses u</a>p to 50MP (ultrawide/periscope). We&apos;ll have to see how all of this pans out in October. Qualcomm is expected to host its annual Summit that same month, meaning the OnePlus 13 could launch shortly after.</p>
