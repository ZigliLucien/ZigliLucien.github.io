<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about how I hoped to see the Android equivalent of an iPad Mini. While we have plenty of options to choose from if you want a powerful tablet with a big screen, smaller tablets are usually packed with less-than-impressive specs. More recently, I've wondered whether a small and powerful Android tablet is really necessary, given that I always carry a foldable phone with me.</p><p>In terms of performance, foldables take the cake, and it's not even close. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> uses the 8 Gen 2, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> relies on the Tensor G4. Sure, the Pixel might fall short of the other two foldables I mentioned, but it's no slouch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BuVjgbdUTB9GY2EW9Jj6dF" name="lenovo-legion-y700-2024-promo-banner.jpg" alt="Lenovo Legion Y700 2024 promo banner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BuVjgbdUTB9GY2EW9Jj6dF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for tablets, there just aren't that many options if you want flagship specs but a screen under 10 inches. Lenovo is really the only game in town, as the Legion Y700 sports an 8.8-inch screen and is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. That presents a different problem, however, as the Y700 isn't officially sold in the States, meaning that you have to go through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giztop.com/lenovo-legion-y700-2024.html" target="_blank">Giztop</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-Lenovo-Legion-Y700.html" target="_blank">AliExpress</a> to get one.</p><p>The smallest flagship tablet that I've come across that is readily available, is the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a>. It too makes use of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but comes with a 10.9-inch screen. While Samsung ditched the 11-inch model with the Galaxy Tab S10, the Tab S9 and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is still available. But even then, we don't know how long that will be the case, and it's still too large.</p><p>All the while, foldable phones offer screens that fall right within the size range that I would want. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is one of the smaller ones with its 7.6-inch display, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review" target="_blank">Vivo X Fold 3 Pro</a> offers up an even larger 8.03-inch panel. Unfortunately, Vivo's foldable presents the same problem as the Y700, as you can't just pick it up in Best Buy or on Amazon.</p>

<p>With all of that being said, do I <em>really</em> need to jump through a bunch of hoops just to get a powerful tablet? Or are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> simply the better overall option for those who either have one or are considering one?</p><p>The short answer to this question should be fairly obvious. But there are a few wrinkles that have kept me from coming to a definitive conclusion.</p><p>Foldable phones are mostly the better option, simply because they're both a phone and a tablet in a single device. With the work that Samsung, Google, and OnePlus have been putting into the software, the experience is also largely the same between each company's foldable phone and tablet offerings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-dex-mode-classic-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Using Classic DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest difference comes in the form of multi-tasking, at least to a certain extent. Many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> and tablets include the ability to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">DeX Mode</a>, essentially turning your device into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>. However, unlike the Galaxy Tab S9 or Tab S10, the only way to use DeX on the Fold 6 is to either plug into an external display or connect to one wirelessly. Meanwhile, you can just tap a button on the Galaxy Tab keyboard and switch over from the traditional tablet interface to DeX mode.</p><p>This isn't the case when looking at the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">Pixel Tablet</a>. Even while running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta, I'm unable to do anything but mirror the screen from the 9 Pro Fold, which is simply disappointing. My disappointment is further compounded by the fact that you can use desktop windowing on an external display with the Pixel 9 Pro XL but not the Pro Fold.</p>
<p>On the bright side, after enabling the "Freeform windows" toggle in Developer Options, I can have up to four free-floating windows on the Pixel Tablet. Things work surprisingly well, and Google has done an excellent job of making things look more aesthetically pleasing than in the days of old. The only downside is that this isn't a feature that's enabled out of the box, but I expect that to change sooner rather than later.</p><p>Although OnePlus doesn't have a specific desktop mode for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">Pad 2</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, it has another trick up its sleeve. You can actually use your phone <em>from</em> the Pad 2, bringing Phone Mirroring to a tablet, which is something I didn't have on my bingo card. Much like the experience is largely the same with Samsung devices, the various features and multitasking options are pretty similar between the OnePlus Pad 2 and Open.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP" name="google-pixel-tablet-freeform-windows.jpg" alt="Freeform windows on the Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area where all of the tablets mentioned have an advantage is when using a stylus. Samsung includes one in the box, Google doesn't sell one at all but relies on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">USI 2.0</a> standard, and while OnePlus does offer one, you have to buy it separately. But that's not the advantage that I'm talking about.</p><p>Excluding the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which lacks stylus support, you'll have to contend with the crease on foldable phones. It's fine for the most part and is a lot better than it used to be, but the crease can still be a source of frustration. None of those problems exist with the slabs of glass on a tablet. Drawing a straight line is entirely dependent on your ability to actually draw a straight line.</p><p>On the flip side, you don't exactly want to whip out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> while you're waiting in line at the store and want to turn a picture into a meme. The same sentiment rings true even with the OnePlus Pad 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9</a>. Meanwhile, provided that you have the S Pen Fold Edition or Oppo Pen you can do exactly that with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 or OnePlus Open.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no arguing or denying that foldable phones are more versatile compared to the best Android tablets or even phones. However, there is one argument to be made, and it's the most important one of them all — price.</p><p>Without taking trade-ins or deals into consideration, you could import the 16GB/512GB model of the Lenovo Legion Y700 2024 from Giztop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giztop.com/lenovo-legion-y700-2024.html">for about $600</a>. Heck, you could even go so far as to toss in the official leather case, Legion Gaming Controller G7, and Lenovo's Stylus Pen, and you would be looking at around $760.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at $1,899, which includes 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you want to match up the storage, the 512GB model will set you back just north of $2,000. Samsung doesn't offer the Fold 6 with 16GB of RAM, and that doesn't include the S Pen or case. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YmTFWEufryiiRhADLHhgTY" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-open.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YmTFWEufryiiRhADLHhgTY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You're looking at another $60 for just the stylus or $100 if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases">official S Pen case</a>. At that price, I could buy two Y700 tablets, complete with accessories, and still have money left over to snag a couple of different controllers or an external SSD to house my ROM collection. </p><p>Now, there's a good chance that you might be swayed into changing your mind in the very near future. The 2024 holiday shopping season is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-sale-top-android-deals-2024">already underway</a>, with Black Friday right around the corner. </p><p>If Prime Day was anything to go by, then I suspect that we'll see some pretty incredible deals pop up for both foldable phones and tablets. With that in mind, don't just jump at the first deal that you see just for the sake of it. Even still, I'm hoping to see some steep discounts on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">foldable phones</a>, but I suspect there will also be plenty of tablet deals to be had. </p><p>For as much as I want foldable phones to take over the world and replace the slabs of glass that we've been reliant on for years, we're just not there yet. Frankly, I don't know if we'll ever actually get there with book-style foldables as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> continue to rise in popularity.</p><p>Simply based on the price alone, and ignoring all of the convenience that foldables offer, tablets are still better. Now, I just need companies to release these small and powerful tablets in the U.S., so I don't have to pay extra just to get one imported.</p>

<ul><li>The Find X8 Ultra is expected to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and a dual-periscope camera setup.</li><li>Leaks suggest a killer quad-camera system with a 50MP 1-inch sensor, ultra-wide lens, and two periscope lenses (3x and 6x optical zoom).</li><li>The camera system will add a Hasselblad multi-spectral sensor for enhanced image quality and color accuracy.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OPPO’s launch of the Find X8 and X8 Pro in China has mobile photography fans buzzing. Meanwhile, rumors of an Ultra model are heating up, with a new leak hinting at even better camera upgrades.</p><p>According to Digital Chat Station&apos;s post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OFgRlirSh" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, OPPO is testing a prototype with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip under the hood (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/alleged-oppo-find-x8-ultra-specifications-snapdragon-8-elite/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>). It’s expected to pack the same dual-periscope camera setup as the Find X8 Pro, but this upgraded chipset should deliver a nice performance boost across the board.</p><p>The tipster also says the Find X8 Ultra will pack a powerful camera system with a 1-inch primary sensor, making it a strong contender for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best camera phone</a> next year.</p><p>Previously, DCS alleged that the Find X8 Ultra will come with a powerful quad-camera setup. It’ll supposedly include a 50MP main sensor with a 1-inch size, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, a 50MP periscope telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and another 50MP periscope lens with 6x optical zoom.</p><p>The leaker also shared that the phone&apos;s camera system will keep the same focal lengths as the Find X8 Pro but adds a new Hasselblad multi-spectral sensor for better image quality and color accuracy. The addition of a multi-spectral sensor is set to take its imaging performance to the next level.</p><p>It’s pretty likely that the Find X8 Ultra will include the Apple-inspired camera button, which first appeared on the Find X8 Pro. This smart design lets users easily control zoom with a swipe.</p><p>The phone will likely feature a single-point ultrasonic fingerprint reader, too. Plus, it’s expected to have an IP68/69 rating, making it resistant to water and dust.</p><p>DCS also claims that the Find X8 Ultra will sport a 6.82-inch display with 2K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, using the same BOE X2 tech seen in the OnePlus 13. The launch is expected around Q1 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-mini-version-of-the-oppo-find-x8-could-be-in-the-works">alongside a smaller "Mini" version of the Find X8</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, the device is likely to pack a 6,000mAh battery with 100W wired fast charging. That’s a step up from the Find X8 Pro (5,910mAh) and the regular Find X8 (5,630mAh).</p><p>OPPO confirming the global launch of the Find X8 and X8 Pro has fans excited. Fingers crossed the X8 Ultra makes its way worldwide too, so more folks can try out its awesome features.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Phone app might soon use Google’s Gemini AI to create dynamic, context-aware replies, making call screening more personalized.</li><li>Internally, Call Screen is known as "dobby," but with the addition of "dobby_AI" and "dobby_LLM," AI-generated responses are on the way.</li><li>The AI Replies feature will use Gemini Nano for smarter responses, so it could be exclusive to Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 9 due to their AI capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been spotted cooking up an "AI Replies" feature for Pixel’s Call Screen, offering smarter, more relevant responses than the current basic options.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/06/pixel-phone-call-screen-ai-replies/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> recently discovered that the Phone app will soon use Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> to create dynamic, context-aware responses for incoming calls, making call screening smarter and more personalized.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screen feature</a> is currently labeled "dobby" internally, but with the recent appearance of "dobby_AI" and "dobby_LLM" in the code, it looks like Google is ready to integrate an AI model to power AI-generated responses.</p><p>Android 12 introduced the call-screening feature that lets you filter calls and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> handle the first chat. It plays an auto-message, grabs the caller's reply, and transcribes it, so you can decide whether to answer or just text back.</p><p>Last December, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">introduced "contextual replies,"</a> which personalize audio responses based on the call's context. The new upgrade is likely to make those replies more dynamic and detailed. You’ll still have the option to select from preset responses on screen rather than typing one out.</p><p>Apparently, Google’s upcoming AI Replies feature will tap into the power of Gemini Nano to offer smarter response suggestions. This could mean that to make the most of Gemini Nano, the feature will be exclusive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> devices, which have the AI processing power needed.</p><p>Though the full capabilities of AI Replies aren’t fully revealed yet, the AI integration is set to greatly improve its ability to understand caller intent and offer more relevant response options.</p><p>AI Replies could totally shake up how we deal with calls. Imagine letting AI handle the awkward conversations, saving you time, and keeping your day from getting interrupted by every random call. This could be what Google had in mind when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-injecting-ai-into-pixel-call-screen">talked about “multi-step, multi-turn conversational AI” last year</a>.</p>

<p>Recent reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-slim-galaxy-s25-might-be-samsungs-answer-to-apples-rumored-thin-iphone-17">suggest there’s a Galaxy S25 Slim model in the works</a>, and a new rumor hints it might come packed with an "Ultra" camera in a slim design.</p><p>Alongside the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a>, Plus, and Ultra models, Samsung is reportedly rolling out a slimmer S25 variant to challenge the rumored iPhone 17 Slim.</p><p>Slim phones usually mean compromises to hardware, especially with the camera, but the Galaxy S25 Slim seems to break that mold.</p><p>Renowned leaker @UniverseIce claimed that the device will pack a camera similar to Samsung's Galaxy Ultra line. While exact specs are still under wraps, it’s rumored this could mean one or more camera sensors from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>—or maybe even the upcoming S25 Ultra.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: The Galaxy S25 Slim is equipped with an “Ultra” camera.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854367791438336189">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>, with its 200MP main camera, shows Samsung is ready to bring top-notch camera tech to more than just its Ultra models.</p><p>While the slimmer Galaxy S25 is expected to pack a strong main camera, details on its secondary lenses are still coming to light. It’s yet to be seen if they’ll match the rumored specs of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is said to have a 50MP ultrawide sensor and a smart variable telephoto lens that makes a second telephoto camera unnecessary.</p><p>While the source behind this leak has a solid track record, it’s best to take it with a grain of salt. Given the slim design, it’s likely the Galaxy S25 Slim will have fewer or less advanced camera sensors compared to the other S25 models.</p><p>Recent discoveries from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/samsungs-mysterious-galaxy-s25-slim-smartphone-officially-spotted-for-first-time/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a>, including a product listing for a phone with the model number SM-S937U in the GSMA IMEI database, offer more proof that the Galaxy S25 Slim is real.</p><p>Smartprix notes that the model number SM-S937 fits the expected naming pattern for the Galaxy S25 series. With the Galaxy S25 likely being SM-S931, the S25 Plus SM-S936, and the S25 Ultra SM-S938, the SM-S937 for the Slim model would make sense as it sits between the Plus and Ultra variants.</p><p>That said, it’s possible the Galaxy S25 Slim won’t launch alongside the main S25 series in early 2025. Smartprix points out that Samsung usually adds devices to the GSMA database about six to seven months before their official release, which lines up with a late spring launch. Since Samsung's next line of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Galaxy phones</a> is expected to drop in late January or early February, the Slim model likely won’t arrive until May or June 2025.</p>

The EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds are thoroughly premium and fresh out of the oven. So it&apos;s really hard to believe that this August 2024 release is already on sale — and it&apos;s not even Black Friday yet!</p><p>Don&apos;t wait around for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">Samsung&apos;s Black Friday discounts</a> to get a good pair of wireless earbuds. I wholeheartedly recommend the fabulous EarFun Air Pro 4 wireless earbuds for top-notch sound quality, an uber-comfortable fit, and state-of-the-art features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5M9SH1X"><strong>Amazon is offering 27% off these buds</strong></a> at the moment, bringing the price down from $89.99 to a more budget-friendly $65.99.</p><p>EarFun gives you everything and more for very little money. You get Google Fast Pair and support for codecs like Qualcomm aptX Adaptive and LDAC. Even the battery life is awesome, lasting for several days with heavy use. These hi-res earbuds are even Auracast-ready, which makes them incredibly future-proof. These are some of the many reasons why the Air Pro 4 are our top budget pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earfun-air-pro-4-review">EarFun Air Pro 4</a> wireless earbuds just came out in August 2024, so it comes as a very welcome surprise to see them 27% off already. You can these nearly-$100 earbuds for a lot more accessible price tag while this pre-Black Friday deal lasts. Equipped with premium features like Bluetooth Auracast, LDAC, and hi-res audio support, these are some high-end earbuds that sound good, look good, and feel good.</p>
<p>The deal ends in just a couple hours, so don't wait if you're interested!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5M9SH1X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="26f1aaf9-5411-4954-b579-bd75fe9ceb28" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$89.99" data-dimension48="$89.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want all the best audio codecs for audiophiles; finding comfortable earbuds is tough for you; you want something with Bluetooth Auracast to be future-proof; longevity of battery life is very important to you; you want wireless charging.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a more robust dust-proof rating; colorful options are high up on your list of must-haves.</p><p>Back when I reviewed the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earfun-air-pro-3-review">EarFun Air Pro 3 buds</a>, I said that they set the bar for 2023. Somehow, EarFun managed to one-up itself this year. The 2024 follow-up isn&apos;t just as good as its prequel — it beats it fair and square.</p><p>You&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find such an awesome mix of features for so less, especially with this deal which slashes a neat 27% off the retail price. EarFun even threw in wireless charging and LED lights to indicate the battery life of the buds.</p><p>The only area where the EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds are lacking is ingress protection. You get an IPX5 splash-proof rating with these buds, which is mediocre at best. Other than that, everything else is a home run.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims the OnePlus 13 could receive Google's offline rediscovery feature, which the Pixel 9 and 8 series have.</li><li>The OnePlus 12 reportedly lacks such "hardware capabilities" to support it; however, the OnePlus 13's Snapdragon 8 Elite is capable.</li><li>Google detailed the function shortly after Find My Device hit more devices, stating (at the time) the Pixel 8 could report its location for "several hours" after turning off.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest OnePlus flagship phone is here, but a recent discovery could indicate more to come.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-powered-off-finding-3497244/">Android Authority</a>), a previous beta for OxygenOS 15 might've teased an upcoming Pixel-exclusive feature for the OnePlus 13. Rahman states that he downloaded the beta on a OnePlus 12 and discovered an Android-provided message when looking at its power options.</p><p>Attempting to shut down the phone displayed, "you can locate this phone with 'Find My Device' even when powered off."</p><p>Curiously, last year's flagship phone isn't receiving such support. The Chinese OEM reportedly confirmed as much to the publication. According to OnePlus' statement, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> contains an "8650 platform" via the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. This limits its capability to support offline rediscovery through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">Find My Device network</a>.</p><p>Confirmation of the OnePlus 12's lack of the offline discovery feature pushed Rahman toward the 2024 flagship. The post adds that the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC contains a FastConnect 7900 connectivity subsystem. Rahman states that Qualcomm confirmed that this subsystem features all the necessities behind the appropriate connection for the Find My Device network's "Power Off Finding."</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">debuted on October 31</a> on home soil in China. Qualcomm's latest flagship SoC grants the device a massive power boost in efficiency and performance. What's more, consumers in China can experience its 6.8-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">2K Oriental display</a> with a 120Hz refresh rate alongside its large 6,000mAh battery.</p><p>The inclusion of the Snapdragon 8 Elite makes it possible for OnePlus to bring offline discovery to its latest smartphone. However, Qualcomm informed Rahman that this feature is "up to OEMs to implement and use it." OnePlus did not announce "Power Off Finding" for the 13 series in October, meaning it's likely still developing it.</p><p>It's speculation, but this function <em>could </em>arrive with a future OxygenOS 15 (Android 15) update.</p><p>Shortly after the revamped Find My Device network hit more devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">Google detailed</a> how its unique Pixel-exclusive feature works. Per its document, the Pixel 8 and 9's offline discovery can function "for several hours" after the phone turns off. Google's recent two flagships were the only ones to have such functionality due to some "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">specialized Pixel hardware.</a>" With Qualcomm's latest SoC including such hardware, we may see more OEMs adopt this useful rediscovery feature.</p><p>In other news, OxygenOS 15 (Android 15) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update">started hitting the OnePlus 12 </a>and is on tap to continue to more of its past-gen devices throughout the year.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> ranks among the best phones of 2024 because it balances elegant design with lightning-fast performance and some of the best camera tech we've used all year. You miss out on some AI features and won't get the same number of OS updates as you would with a Samsung or Pixel device, but with a whopping $150 discount on the phone at Best Buy, I'm not complaining. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12-512gb-unlocked-flowy-emerald/6570639.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="92cc86e1-c5e6-4c63-a6e9-bb9657d85edd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h2 id="when-does-the-oneplus-13-come-out-2">When does the OnePlus 13 come out?</h2>
<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> was officially announced at a launch event in China on October 30th and was released in that country on November 4th. While we don&apos;t have a global release date just yet, if the new flagship follows the trend set by the OnePlus 12 we&apos;ll probably get our hands on the phone sometime in January. </p>
<h2 id="when-do-the-black-friday-sales-start-2">When do the Black Friday sales start?</h2>
<p>Although Black Friday doesn&apos;t technically arrive until November 29th this year, retailers have wasted no time in dropping holiday deals before the big weekend. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-sale-top-android-deals-2024">Best Buy formally launched its sale this week</a>, and we expect other sites to follow suit in the coming days.

<ul><li>A report highlights Motorola's updated patent for its rollable phone concept, Rizr.</li><li>The U.S. patent shows Motorola's plans to incorporate additional fingerprint-on-display (FOD) sensors on the "front" and "back" of the device.</li><li>Motorola showcased the Rizr during MWC 2023, showcasing its default 5-inch display and fully extended 6.5-inch screen when rolled out.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola has had a rollable phone concept stewing for a while and a newly published patent details some additions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/motorola-new-patent-rollable-display-full-screen-fingerprint-sensing/">MySmartPrice</a> spotted an updated patent for the company's rollable phone concept, the "Motorola Rizr." The patent details a device with multiple fingerprint-reading sensors in the USPTO database listing. According to the abstract, Motorola states the device in question "provides a predictable external fingerprint area on a 'rollable display device' for fingerprint authentication."</p><p>The company adds, "this is available at least in both a fully retracted position and fully extended position."</p><p>U.S. patents published on November 5 show at least two positions users <em>could </em>utilize on this rollable phone. The first fingerprint-on-display (FOD) sensor is on the "front" of the phone in its retracted state. Motorola's patent states a user would find this sensor centered near the bottom of the device.</p><p>The second is featured on the back of the phone. At the very least, such a design would give some additional purpose to the "backside" of the display when it's in a compact state.</p>

<p>The publication dove into the patent further, but couldn't find any additional changes/updates. The post states the device's concept retains its 6.5-inch display when fully rolled out (5 inches when retracted).</p><p>Motorola showed off its rollable phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-rizr-concept-mwc-2023">during MWC 2023</a>. During the event, users quickly discovered a hidden front-facing camera and speaker. The device offers a 5-inch display by default, but this display rolls back even further automatically when taking a selfie or on a call. Moreover, additional insight by Android Central during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-rizr-is-the-sharper-image-of-the-smartphone-world">a visit to Motorola's HQ in Chicago</a> showed that shifting its orientation (from portrait to landscape) during a video would see it extend on its own.</p><p>While it's a cool concept, the durability of such a device was called forward. The display isn't flush to the chassis and some parts seem far too exposed when fully rolled out. This is a concept, meaning things can always change — or it could never see a store shelf.</p><p>However, there's no hiding that OEMs are consistently seeking the "next big thing," like a rollable phone. Motorola has the Rizr still in its concept era and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-x-2021-rollable-concept-phone-tablet-74-inch-screen">OPPO X 2021</a> took the spotlight in 2020. More importantly, Samsung was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">rumored to be <em>more </em>interested</a> in a rollable phone after Huawei's Mate XT (tri-fold) debuted.</p>

The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be getting the lion's share of the attention this time around, similar to what we saw earlier this year, but that doesn't mean the rest of the pack is any less exciting.</p><p>Quite the contrary, actually. It's actually been difficult narrowing it down to the three things I'm looking forward to the most, but I think I can be confident that the following list represents the best of what we're expecting to see from Samsung in January.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S Ultra series has had a bit of a controversial design over the past few years. The Galaxy S22 Ultra took many design cues from the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, carrying on the Note line in everything but the name. Largely, this design meant sharp, square corners and rounded edges.</p><p>I've never been a fan of this design and apparently someone else hasn't either, as Samsung may be switching things up this time arounf, quite literally flipping the squared and rounded edges according to all the rumors and leaks we've seen so far. That means the Galaxy S25 Ultra may have round corners and flat sides just as we saw Samsung do with the Galaxy S24 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">earlier this year</a>.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fiberborne.com/products/super-thin-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-aramid-fiber-magsafe"></a></p>

<p>Mobile processors have been pretty boring for the past few years now. While we've seen performance gains year over year, most of those improvements end up being lost to excess heat when playing games for more than 20 or 30 minutes. A lot of emphasis has been placed on AI processing because of it, but the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processors substantially improve all aspects of mobile processing without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Early results <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.antutu.com/doc/133085.htm">from benchmark company Antutu</a> paint the picture we were hoping to see. Not only does the Snapdragon 8 Elite run significantly faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>, but it runs several degrees Celsius cooler, too.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/compare/8681992?baseline=8681811">Geekbench results</a> from the Xiaomi 15, one of the first phones to ship with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the new processor runs about 40% faster than the one that launched earlier this year. That's a huge improvement!</p><p>This level of speed has been achieved because Qualcomm was able to pack its brand new custom Oryon processing cores into the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the same exact cores it uses in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> that powers many popular Windows laptops in 2024.</p>

What happens then? I usually just hit clear all and figure it out later.</p><p>This new notification summary feature will help deliver quick, concise summaries of groups of notifications so I can stay in the know without feeling overwhelmed. That's the real AI upgrade I've been waiting for, and the phone's hardware will be perfectly equipped to handle these new AI features, especially with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</p>

<p>My three favorite things about the Galaxy S25 certainly sound compelling, but they allegedly come with a price hike that no one wants to pay. That's where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S24 Black Friday deals</a> come in. No matter what Samsung will be selling the Galaxy S25 for, it's impossible for the company to offer its phones at any better price than the Galaxy S24 is selling these days.</p><p>In just a few weeks, we'll be in the midst of Black Friday and all the crazy sales. Since the Galaxy S24 debuted 10 months ago, you know you'll be getting the best price possible on Samsung's 2024 phones so that they can make room for the 2025 models.</p><p>If price is a big concern in the coming months, it's probably best to stick with what's currently available, especially since Samsung offers seven years of software upgrades for its Galaxy S24 line. That means One UI 7 is the first of seven total OS updates that'll debut on the phones until support officially ends.</p><p>Getting a phone at a reduced price <em>and</em> getting seven years of guaranteed updates is a surefire way to ensure that you're getting the very best deal this year with no compromises.</p>

<ul><li>The CSA highlighted the arrival of its Matter 1.4 upgrade for smart homes.</li><li>The update adds support for more devices like water heaters and heat pumps, as well as improved thermostat support for preset modes.</li><li>Matter rolled out its 1.3 upgrade earlier this year, where it welcomed EV chargers and smart home appliances.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The CSA continues its mission to improve the connectivity of consumers' smart home devices as the latest major upgrade rolls out.</p><p>Yet again, the CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/">detailed a host of newly supported</a> smart home devices for the 1.4 update. According to the post, Matter connectivity now supports solar-powered devices such as inverters, individual and panel arrays, and hybrid solar/battery systems. Batteries (battery walls, storage units, etc.) are also said to be supported with the latest update.</p><p>In time for the colder months, the CSA states Matter welcomes Heat Pumps and Water Heaters. The post states that the connectivity's "energy management" capabilities should aid homeowners with (power) consumption forecasts alongside the ability to "adjust" its usage during peak hours. For the latter, the CSA says the 1.4 upgrade adds a new "Water Heater Mode Cluster." This is designed to bring a toggling feature for set schedules.</p><p>Moreover, thermostats receive support for scheduling and "preset modes." The CSA states that its supported preset modes include "home/away and vacation." The post adds that presets can be triggered via motion detection, calendar events, and integration with other devices.</p><p>The CSA highlights support for electric vehicle supply equipment and its "Device Energy Management" to help users optimize the energy usage of their smart home products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:944px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Y4FJDGNJXUUJZmqr9erBeK" name="Matter-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Matter certified device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4FJDGNJXUUJZmqr9erBeK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="944" height="531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Matter)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery-powered devices receive enhancements to help "optimize" battery life and communication with switches, buttons, and sensors.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post states the 1.4 upgrade introduces better "Multi-Admin" support. The CSA informs users that this should help make management easier as it brings "single user consent" for devices. In short, homeowners can seamlessly connect new or existing smart home devices to "multiple ecosystems automatically."</p><p>The Alliance is also upgrading its Matter-certified HRAP devices to combine a home's Wi-Fi access point and Thread Border Router. The post states this is designed to strengthen the required infrastructure for other Matter products.</p><p>The 1.4 upgrade is available now; however, it may take a while before a given platform integrates it for users.</p><p>Matter's latest update is the second rollout in 2024, as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">1.3 upgrade arrived in May</a>. That update brought support and energy management controls for EV chargers alongside home appliances. Water management devices were also roped into the Matter connectivity push as the CSA included "leak and freeze detectors, rain sensors, and controllable water valves."</p><p>It's worth noting that Google was spotted preparing enhanced Matter-supported device controls <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/android-15-matter-thread-netowrk-support-previewed">over the Thread network</a>. Devices that contain the appropriate Thread radio may receive increased efficiency and "performance enhancements" through Android 15.</p>
