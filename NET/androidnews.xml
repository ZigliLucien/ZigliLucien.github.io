                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I started using Authy to manage my 2FA tokens well over a half decade ago; I used Google Authenticator previously, but as I was starting to switch devices regularly, I needed a solution that works across several devices, iOS, and Windows. To its credit, Authy offered everything I needed of a 2FA client, so I moved all of my tokens to the service, and it has been hassle-free — until now.</p><p>Authy stores 2FA tokens associated with your account on its servers, and you&apos;ll need to set up a backup password to decrypt accounts when moving to a new device. The backup password isn&apos;t stored anywhere, and while there have been a few glitches in the past when the password wasn&apos;t recognized on a new device, resetting it on the older device and keying in the new one always did the trick.</p><p>But that dynamic changed earlier this week. I was switching away from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a> to Vivo&apos;s X100 Ultra, and when I tried to enter the backup password in Authy, it said the credentials were incorrect. So I reset them on the 8 Pro, and entered the details again on the X100 Ultra, to no avail. I figured there must be an issue with the package, so I uninstalled Authy and did a reinstall, but the same issue remained.</p>
<p>I switch between devices every two weeks on average, and logging in to Authy on a new phone is as routine as backing up photos while configuring a new device. So I went back to a phone I was using last month (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a>) and pulled up Authy on that device to see if the new password would take. Again, the service said the password was incorrect, and no amount of clearing cache/data and reinstalling made a difference.</p><p>I have been mulling a switch to another 2FA service for a while now, but kept putting it off because of the hassle involved. While other 2FA providers make it easy to transfer data, Authy doesn&apos;t have that provision — in that sense, it is the Evernote of 2FA clients. This meant that I had to manually reconfigure 2FA on all of my accounts to move to another service.</p>

<p>When it comes to choosing an alternative, there are lots of great choices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis Authenticator</a> ticks a lot of the right boxes, but it doesn&apos;t work for my own use case as I need something that syncs across devices seamlessly. That&apos;s why I switched to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://2fas.com/">2FAS</a>; the service is free and open source, has a browser extension that&apos;s ideal on Windows, and syncs via Google Drive, making it extremely easy to set up when moving to a new phone.</p><p>The best part is that you don&apos;t need to furnish a phone number to use the service, and if you want to stay anonymous, you don&apos;t need to use Drive sync. The only issue in my usage is that as it relies on Drive, you cannot set it up on iOS — this is the same issue with WhatsApp. That said, you can easily back up all 2FA tokens to a file, and use that while setting up 2FAS on an iPhone — that&apos;s what I did, and it works seamlessly.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that 2FAS has a clean design, and you get a widget on both Android and iOS. It excels at providing time-based one-time passwords for your accounts, and does so without needing you to share any unnecessary details. Combine that with the ease of use and its ability to work across devices, and it is now my go-to 2FA recommendation.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is discontinuing Stack: PDF Scanner later this year, with the app ceasing to function on September 23.</li><li>The app's features, like automatic edge detection and document capture, have been integrated into Google Drive, making Stack redundant.</li><li>Stack users can easily transfer their documents to Google Drive via an "Export all documents to Drive" option in Stack's account settings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>To streamline its document management tools, Google is discontinuing "Stack: PDF Scanner" later this year, phasing out the app known for its scanning and organization features.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/15128833" target="_blank">community post</a>, a Google spokesperson confirmed that Stack: PDF Scanner has been permanently discontinued. The app will stop functioning entirely on September 23, and its listing has already been removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Store</a>. This marks the definitive end of the document scanning app.</p><p>The rationale for shuttering the app seems logical. It was developed by Google&apos;s internal Area 120 incubator, which no longer exists. Stack <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-area-120-develops-stack-document-scanner">stood out for its user-friendly design</a>. The app featured automatic edge detection and document capture, making scanning super easy with minimal effort. It also had a handy automated document categorization system. However, Google insists that these features are now integrated into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>, making Stack unnecessary.</p><p>In November, the Drive app received a dedicated "Scan" function, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/25/google-stack-pdf-scanner/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This new feature includes a custom viewfinder for better document alignment and more intuitive controls for a seamless scanning process.</p><p>The "Auto capture" mode automatically takes a picture when the document is optimally positioned, removing the need for manual clicks. There&apos;s also a manual capture mode if you want to do things your way.</p><p>Using machine learning, Google Drive suggests relevant titles for scanned documents. For instance, when scanning a receipt, Drive might automatically add the store location and date.</p><p>The latest change marks a significant step in consolidating document management within Drive. Users can now rely on this all-in-one platform for scanning and organizing their important documents.</p>

<p>This strategic move aligns with Google&apos;s broader goal of streamlining its services.</p><p>To make things easier for Stack users, Google has set up a simple way to move everything over to Drive. If you&apos;re used to using Stack, you can find an "Export all documents to Drive" option in the app&apos;s account settings. This makes it a breeze to transfer all your documents to a specific folder in Drive, so the switch is smooth and hassle-free.</p>

It was decent enough at the beginning, but it didn&apos;t take long for the connector to start acting up — it would lose connection every time I looked at it — and the drive was <em>slow </em>even by early 2010s standards.</p>

<p>Using the drive made me realize I needed a long-term solution that was actually reliable, and that&apos;s how I got started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">home NAS servers</a> — in a sense, I should be thankful I picked up that drive. Anyway, my data these days is housed entirely in NAS servers, and I use a smattering of external SSDs if I need storage on the go. As such, I haven&apos;t paid much attention to external HDDs, but given that they still sell in considerable numbers, I wanted to see if things have changed.</p><p>I got started with Seagate&apos;s Ultra Touch and LaCie Mobile Drive, and both have proven to be highly reliable in just over a month of use. The Ultra Touch in particular is very intriguing; Seagate uses 30% post-consumer materials in the chassis, and the drive itself is small enough that you can just throw it (gently) in a bag. The biggest plus point is that it connects over USB-C, and I had zero issues using it with my Windows machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JLAGtS7HafaCuxtZKXqXdW" name="seagate-ultra-touch-4.jpg" alt="Seagate Ultra Touch external HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLAGtS7HafaCuxtZKXqXdW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other niceties include AES-256 encryption, giving you the ability to easily safeguard the data on the drive. There is no audible noise when using the drive, and even after transferring a sizeable chunk of data, it didn&apos;t get too hot. </p><p>While there has been a lot of innovation in the HDD segment in recent years — including helium-encased drives and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/30tb-hard-drives-with-hamr-tech-are-now-a-reality-and-im-thrilled">emergence of HAMR tech</a> — that has all been aimed at 3.5-inch options, and 2.5-inch drives are relatively unchanged. The only key difference is that most of these drives now connect over USB-C.</p><p>I tested the Ultra Touch extensively over the course of the last month, and the drive routinely averaged transfers of 135MB/s, which is more than adequate if you just need a reliable drive for daily use. Granted, an external SSD will go up to 660MB/s on average when transferring data from an internal NVMe drive.</p>

<p>But there&apos;s another factor at play, and that is pricing. The Ultra Touch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Ultra-Touch-External-Drive/dp/B0BN4DXRC6/">costs $165 for the 5TB version</a>, and that comes out to $33/terabyte. There isn&apos;t an equivalent SSD, but the Crucial X9 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pro-4TB-Portable-CT4000X9PROSSD902/dp/B0C9WGQY8G">will set you back by $260</a> if you get the 4TB model, coming out to $65/terabyte — double that of the HDD.</p><p>Obviously, an external SSD has much faster transfers, is noticeably smaller, and will last longer. But if you want to maximize storage value, an external HDD still has a lot to offer in 2024. I&apos;ll be conducting long-term tests to see how these drives measure up as that will be a better indicator to their reliability, but if you have a lot of data and are looking to get an external drive for archival, the Ultra Touch ticks all the right boxes.</p>

<ul><li>Huawei will move away from the Android Open Source Project for HarmonyOS Next.</li><li>The next version of the company’s mobile operating system will be built on its own custom architecture.</li><li>The move will drop support for Google apps, but it will improve performance and efficiency on Huawei devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Huawei will be fully moving away from Android apps on its devices with the next version of HarmonyOS, called HarmonyOS Next. The new version of Huawei’s in-house operating system was previewed this week at HDC 2024, the company’s developer conference. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/06/21/huawei-unveils-harmonyos-next-star-shield-security-harmony-intelligence/" target="_blank">GizmoChina</a>, HarmonyOS Next will leave behind the Android Open Source Project, and will instead be built on Huawei’s custom architecture. </p><p>The decision comes with some significant consequences. After losing support for Google apps a few years ago due to economic sanctions, Huawei devices will now lose support for Android apps altogether. A big benefit to using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a> is compatibility with Android apps. Developers can tweak the AOSP as they see fit, but still benefit from the exhaustive list of apps built on AOSP architecture.</p><p>As extreme examples, both the Humane AI Pin and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> are built on the AOSP architecture. They’re not Android devices in the conventional sense, but they use the AOSP codebase. That means they are <em>technically</em> compatible with Android apps. It’s how tinkerers were able to crack the Rabbit R1 and load up Android launchers and apps on the device with no translation, emulation, or other extreme efforts required.</p><p>Since HarmonyOS is built on AOSP, it can download and install Android apps. That will change when HarmonyOS Next releases with Huawei’s custom architecture. Developers will need to be ported to the Hongmeng kernel and system, according to GizmoChina. This process has been underway since 2023, but it’s unclear how many apps are available on HarmonyOS Next right now. The company says that popular apps Taobao, Yiche, and Bilibili are all running natively on the platform. </p><p>The move might work in China, as many apps are consolidated and offer many functions in the same place. For example, WeChat is the world’s largest standalone mobile app and serves as a messaging service, social media platform, and mobile payments provider. It’s effectively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, Facebook/Instagram, and PayPal all in one — if we’re comparing WeChat to its Western equivalents. So, if Huawei got a handful of core apps on HarmonyOS Next, it could be successful even without Android app support. </p><p>Due to sanctions from the U.S. and other governments, Huawei phones haven’t been a viable consideration for most people outside of China for years. That becomes even more true now that Android apps will be left behind completely when HarmonyOS Next launches.</p><p>However, it’s not ready yet. Huawei says that HarmonyOS Next is currently in the beta testing stage and is looking for roughly 3,000 developers and beta testers. It’s been a slow and steady development process for HarmonyOS Next, and that‘s unsurprising. This will be a significant Huawei and comes with a lot of risk.</p>

<p>Looking at the broader circumstances Huawei is facing, the move to build HarmonyOS on its own architecture over the Android Open Source Project actually makes a lot of sense. The aforementioned sanctions have limited Huawei’s ability to source equipment needed to create cutting-edge processors. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smic-everything-you-need-know">Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)</a>, which designs and fabricates Huawei chips, can’t import equipment due to U.S. sanctions and treaties with other countries. </p><p>Something called an Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) machine allows chipmakers to produce faster and better chips than they could using older Deep Ultraviolet Lithography (DUV) equipment. That‘s why Huawei’s latest smartphone chip was made using the 7nm process, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has already developed mobile chips using the 3nm process.</p><p>There are reports that SMIC may be able to make 5nm chips using the DUV equipment it has, though it would be costly and inefficient. Either way, Huawei‘s chips would still be behind the competition.</p><p>Moving to a custom HarmonyOS Next version built on its own architecture could increase efficiency and make the most out of its meager microprocessors. In fact, that’s exactly what Huawei is hoping for. The company says HarmonyOS Next will bring 30% faster performance overall and a 20% lower power draw. Ditching AOSP, then, could be a good thing. If Huawei can deliver top-notch performance using HarmonyOS Next and get crucial developers onboard, Huawei users in China might not miss Android apps. </p><p>Still, this decision highlights the difficulties Huawei has faced since it was sanctioned massively by the U.S. government and others. If the company had access to state-of-the-art equipment, international sales, and Google apps, perhaps it wouldn’t need to move away from the Android Open Source Project. However, when you consider what Huawei’s options are, choosing competitive overall performance and battery life over expanded app support may be the right move. </p>

<ul><li>Continuous scrolling on Google Search was introduced for mobile in October 2021 and expanded to desktop in late 2022, and now, it's being phased out for both.</li><li>Google Search users will return to a more structured search experience with the pagination bar.</li><li>Desktop users will use the "next" button or jump to specific pages, while mobile users will have a "more results" button.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is ending its infinite scroll feature for search results, according to Search Engine Land. This change means users will go back to a more structured search experience.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-search-continuous-scrolling-update">rolling out continuous scrolling for mobile searches in October 2021</a>, Google expanded this feature to desktop searches by late 2022. Borrowing a concept popularized by social media, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">Google Search</a> allowed users to effortlessly browse through an endless stream of content, encouraging passive exploration.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://searchengineland.com/google-dropping-continuous-scroll-in-search-results-443529" target="_blank">Search Engine Land</a> that the company has now stopped continuous scrolling for desktop search results. Later this month, it will also end infinite scrolling on mobile search results.</p><p>In a statement to the outlet, Google explained why it&apos;s discontinuing infinite scrolling for search results. The change aims to improve loading times by stopping the automatic pre-loading of results users might not want. Google&apos;s data also showed that, despite encouraging exploration, infinite scrolling didn&apos;t lead to a better user experience.</p><p>Moving away from infinite scroll means bringing back the familiar pagination bar at the bottom of search results. Desktop users can now use the "next" button or jump to specific pages. Likewise, mobile users will see a "more results" button, allowing for more intentional search navigation.</p><p>Since continuous scrolling was introduced just a few years ago, most users will likely find the return to the pagination bar quite familiar.</p><p>The shift away from infinite scrolling has ignited debates about its impact on user behavior and website traffic. SEO experts have long advised that results beyond the first page get minimal clicks. Infinite scroll improved visibility for lower-ranked sites by displaying more results seamlessly. With pagination making a comeback, it will be interesting to see if traffic to those lower-ranked sites decreases.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp beta version 2.24.14.5 brings a new shortcut to the video messaging experience.</li><li>A few testers have spotted this shortcut, which lets them quickly respond to video messages by tapping it instead of opening the app's old menu.</li><li>WhatsApp recently started a test for a default option to send photos and videos in HD quality.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest WhatsApp beta is reportedly improving the texting experience with video messages in chat threads.</p><p>A dive into version <strong>2.24.14.5</strong> of the WhatsApp beta on Android, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-14-5-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> discovered a new shortcut for video message replies (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-quickly-reply-to-instant-video-messages/">Android Police</a>). The beta now displays a small icon beside a video message, which looks like a camera with a reply arrow moving left.</p><p>An update like this should breathe a little more convenience into the previous video replying system. WhatsApp requires users to rediscover a video manually and head into its menu before creating their reply. The shortcut cuts out the extra steps by offering a quick, easy-to-tap button to reply and send.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when this update will arrive for all stable users of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>, however, the new beta version is available via the Play Store.</p><p>The post adds that the quick reply shortcut is appearing for "some" testers, meaning its rollout is still ongoing, and more should see it as the week progresses.</p>

<p>This beta version marks the second iterative update to improve the video experience in WhatsApp as another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-finally-lets-you-send-hd-photos-and-videos-by-default">boosted its quality</a>. Appearing in beta version 2.24.13.10 earlier in June, the service tested an option to set the default quality of uploads as HD. Testing showed that WhatsApp intends to allow HD uploads of photos <em>and </em>videos once its testing concludes.</p><p>The move to bring videos into the mix is likely due to the addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-send-hd-photos">HD photo uploads</a> last August. The platform warns that choosing to upload at HD quality will consume more bandwidth and storage space.</p><p>A more recent stable update improved the app&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-highlights-calling-experience-updates">video and voice calling</a> experience. WhatsApp rolled out updates such as "Speaker Spotlight" and finally brought audio to the screen-sharing feature. Moreover, older devices received an update, which should help facilitate crystal clear calls no matter how old the device is on Android and iOS.</p>

The list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> just keeps growing and growing!

<h2 id="metal-hellsinger-vr-2">Metal: Hellsinger VR</h2>

<p>Metal: Hellsinger VR is essentially what happens if you take Doom to a heavy metal concert. It&apos;s a new brand of musical wonder as you&apos;ve never experienced before, even if you&apos;ve already played the original Metal: Hellsinger. Shredding has a whole new meaning.</p><p>Pistol Whip might be <em>the</em> definitive action/adventure rhythm game on Quest right now, but Metal: Hellsinger is looking to make a name for itself with this total VR remake of the newly minted classic. Pillage your way through hellish levels with a pulse-pounding metal soundtrack, shooting to the beat and getting bonus points for your music talent.</p><p><strong>Wishlist on the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6490578927725908">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Battle Talent is getting a massive new multiplayer update, further improving its critically acclaimed roguelike gameplay by adding friends into the mix. There&apos;s no doubt that people will draw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">Dungeons of Eternity</a> similarities to the game now that it supports 4-player multiplayer, but that&apos;s certainly not a bad thing from my standpoint.</p><p>As a roguelike, you&apos;ll join up and fight through and endless number of dungeons, looting along the way until you eventually die. That loot is then taken back to a base where you can upgrade your stats, weapons, and armor, amassing over 100 weapons, 60 perks, and fighting 80 different kinds of enemies.</p><p>Plus, Meta Quest 3 players now have access to a brand-new mixed-reality mode that&apos;ll have goblins jumping off your couch. It&apos;s a ton of fun, and the new update makes it even better!</p><p><strong>Get it at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/8752849024786000/">Meta Horizon Store</a> | <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1331510/Battle_Talent/">Steam</a></p>

<p>The Infinite Inside is a spectacle of a mixed reality game that combines two disparate worlds into one fascinating adventure puzzle game. Based on the earlier demo, each level starts in your physical room with a small tower that pops out of the floor. You&apos;ll have to search in and around the tower for puzzle pieces, eventually assembling them to create the key to unlock the tower&apos;s entrance.</p><p>Once that happens, you&apos;ll be transported inside the tower, and that&apos;s where the real fun comes in. While the puzzle portion of the game is certainly fun, exploring the tower <em>from the inside</em> is even more amazing.</p><p>I got my hands on the game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">a few months back</a> and was blown away by how seamless and surreal the transition between my living room and the virtual world is, further enhanced by the fact that you warp <em>into</em> the virtual tower in front of you once you&apos;ve unlocked its entrance. This one&apos;s coming out in just a month, so you won&apos;t have to wait long to experience it!</p><p><strong>Wishlist on the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6467768793276403">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Did you ever play the classic PC strategy game Dungeon Keeper back in the day? If so, Underworld Overseer is <em>exactly</em> what you&apos;ve been hoping for, as it feels very much like a VR version of Dungeon Keeper. Plus, it&apos;s made by the same folks that brought us the lovable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/deisim-for-oculus-quest-filled-the-void-in-my-heart-that-black-and-white-left">Deisim</a>, a game that evokes the feelings of classic strategy games like Black & White and Civilization.</p><p>The game spans 18 levels, each of which takes around 20-25 minutes apiece to complete. Plus, completing each level unlocks a hard version to play after, giving strategy buffs something to really test their skills.</p><p>I&apos;ve actually been playing an early build of Underworld Overseer for the past month and have been thoroughly impressed with its quality. I&apos;m a huge Dungeon Keeper fan and loved playing the games when I was younger. Being able to pick up creatures with my hands and quickly move them around is a dream come true for micro-managing.</p><p>Plus, the team&apos;s expertise from Deisim shines through, giving this a truly built-for-VR feel instead of just feeling like a classic game ported to a VR interface. And it&apos;s got an incredible visual flair, with the cleanest visuals I&apos;ve <em>ever</em> seen on the Quest 3. I seriously can&apos;t believe how sharp and clean it looks!</p><p>Underworld Overseer launches later this year on October 31.</p>

<p>Smash Drums is already one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> you can buy, and part of that is because of the hard work that the developer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MrPotam">MrPotam</a> puts in. Today&apos;s Freakin Rock Show update features both solo and multiplayer enhancements and is available right now for the Meta Quest platform.</p><p>Solo mode now features significantly enhanced stadiums to play in, including crowds waving and cheering, and lights that are synced with the music. As you might expect, things just get wilder as you do better in the game. Plus, there&apos;s a bunch of new mixed reality improvements to bring those stadium lights to your room. Additional effects have also been added to multiplayer arenas, helping to spruce up your already exciting music-making sessions.</p><p>The Pop Rock Legends DLC is coming July 8th and will feature a bunch of popular punk rock songs for just a few bucks. Smash Drums regularly has updates and new DLC packs, ensuring that there&apos;s always new music to smash to.</p><p><strong>Get it now at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/3630025217090808/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Cubism creator Thomas Van Bouwel is back with Laser Dance, a mixed reality game with some serious Mission Impossible vibes. Step into the shoes of a secret agent and make your way through a field of lasers that magically appear in the very room you&apos;re physically standing in. It&apos;s a <em>very</em> different kind of puzzle game from Cubism as it requires not just your hands and mind this time, but your entire body to complete.</p><p><strong>Wishlist now on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7209598115800315/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>While the name might immediately evoke thoughts of a VR Dark Souls game, this one is actually Price of Persia VR. Maybe more specifically, Ember Souls feels like the VR port of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time with its time-warping abilities, epic parkour scenes, and intricate puzzles to solve along the way.</p><p>The combat looks impressive and the trailer notes that players will make their way through beautiful Persian palaces with ornate visuals that push the limits of Meta Quest hardware. Ember Souls debuts this Fall.</p><p><strong>Wishlist on the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7618457878170007/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Roller Coaster Tycoon fans, unite! This mixed reality coaster building game features over 50 different levels to complete in a full campaign mode, or you can just build to your heart&apos;s content — so long as physics are on your side, of course. Plus, riding coasters you&apos;ve personally built is a completely different feeling.</p><p><strong>Grab it on early access at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7856648691073700">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Few VR games feature the level of polish and believable scripted sequences that you&apos;ll see in Zero Caliber 2. It&apos;s the "Call of Duty VR" you&apos;ve been waiting for, and its immersive dozen-hour-long campaign will have you gritting your teeth the entire time. It&apos;s incredibly intense and will regularly blow your mind with how much is going on.</p><p>While it&apos;s obviously a direct sequel to the original Zero Caliber, you don&apos;t need to have played the first game to have a good time here. Folks who have played the original will understand the story better, of course, but the excellent voice acting and well-written sequences will impress everyone regardless of past experiences.</p><p>I&apos;ve had the chance to play the full game and was beyond impressed with what I got to play. I thought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/tired-of-vr-shooting-games">I was sick of shooters</a> at the beginning of this year but games like Zero Caliber 2 have showed me that there&apos;s plenty of room for high-quality games, even if the experience might seem initially familiar.</p><p><strong>Preorder now at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6072194326150034/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>If you&apos;ve ever wondered what it would be like to be <em>inside</em> of a pinball machine, you&apos;re in luck because Bounce Arcade answers that very question. Wrack up high scores as you wrack up a serious workout by embodying the flippers you&apos;ll find inside a pinball machine, all while completing minigames and having a total blast.</p><p>Bounce Arcade is coming this Fall.</p>

<p>What happens when you mix Ghosts of Tabor with No Man&apos;s Sky? You get Astro Hunters, of course! Join up with other players and scavenge planets but beware because you can&apos;t truly trust anyone. It&apos;s entirely possible to dispatch other players and steal their equipment and spoils, especially on those more valuable expeditions. If you die, you lose it all!</p><p><strong>Wishlist now on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/24397129266601725/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>There&apos;s no shortage of post apocalyptic games and movies, but The Burst breathes some fresh air into the genre by melding some of Mirror&apos;s Edge&apos;s high intensity parkour with the vibes of Mad Max.

<p>Everyone loves SUPERHOT VR. It&apos;s the quintessential "must play" game on Quest aside from Beat Saber. If you haven&apos;t played it before, the concept is that time moves when you do. Stay still, plan your attack, and move in for the kill. So what does this have to do with COLD VR? Everything, really.</p><p>COLD VR is, essentially, SUPERHOT VR in reverse. In COLD VR, standing still is a death wish as time moves the moment you stop. Keep moving and you&apos;ll be like Neo from the Matrix, always outwitting and outmaneuvering your opponents before they can act. It&apos;s the spiritual successor to SUPERHOT VR we&apos;ve been asking for!</p><p>COLD VR is coming later this year but you can play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2636890/COLD_VR/">a demo on Steam</a> right now.</p>

<hr>
<p>Snapchat is highlighting a few new tools that are arriving for its community that might provide a little more peace of mind.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://values.snap.com/news/new-features-to-help-protect-our-community?lang=en-US">Policy Hub post</a>, Snapchat announced an expansion of safeguard measures to better protect its users from "suspicious" users. Moving forward, teen users should notice an improved version of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://values.snap.com/news/new-safeguards-for-snapchatters-2023?lang=en-US">in-app warnings</a>. Snapchat states such users will be warned about a user with an unsavory past, i.e; they&apos;ve been blocked or reported several times before.</p><p>Additionally, the new in-app warnings will factor in whether or not the person privately messaging a user is from another country. The post adds that such a signal could be indicative of a scam, thus provoking the warning.</p><p>Snapchat details "enhanced friending protections," designed to go hand-in-hand with the upgraded in-app warnings. These new protections should make it more difficult for strangers to use Search and discover teen users through Quick Add. The app is said to block the delivery of a friend request from a user a teen account doesn&apos;t have a mutual friend with.</p>

<p>The block button gains a buff, with the company stating that blocking a user will now "block new friend requests sent from other accounts created on the same device." The intention is to help get a handle on early signs of cyberbullying and other forms of harassment.</p><p>Lastly, Snapchat states it&apos;s increasing the frequency of its location-sharing reminders. This will be joined by the introduction of "simplified location-sharing" through the Snap Map. The feature will provide simpler customization controls to help users quickly enable which friends can view their current location.</p><p>Users will find options to select which friends are excluded from seeing their location or handpicking a specific list of users. Additionally, users can have their location open to everyone they&apos;ve befriended.</p><p>These security and safety updates should begin rolling out in the days ahead.</p><p>Similarly, Meta introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-stricter-messaging-settings-instgram-facebook">an array of protections</a> for supervised teen accounts on Instagram and Facebook earlier this year. Not only must teens submit a request for a settings change, but "Stricter Messaging" rolled in to protect those aged 16 (or 18) from texts from unknown users.</p><p>In other news, Snapchat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-edit-button-teaser-feature-highlights">highlighted a few new features</a> for its platform, such as My AI reminders, avatar reactions in Snap Map, and Bitmoji customization options. The kicker in that previous update was confirmation of an edit button for messages. Snapchat calls them "editable chats," giving users five minutes to return to a text to correct mistakes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-plus-launch">Snapchat Plus</a> subscribers will get their hands on this before it flows down to everyone else.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new update for its Chrome app on Android and iOS, bringing with it five new features.</li><li>The update includes new Chrome Actions, making it easier to interact with search results as you type.</li><li>There's also a "refreshed" address bar for Chrome on tablets, as it will now show the current website in the drop-down menu.</li></ul>
<p>Things have been pretty quiet on the Chrome front lately, but as version 126 starts rolling out, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-mobile-features-june-2024/">Google has included</a> five new features. Although none of these features are "ground-breaking," there are a couple of exciting ones.</p><p>Although it&apos;s not the first highlight on Google&apos;s list, the Chrome address bar has been redesigned for the iPad and Android tablets. Along with being tweaked to make better use of the screen real estate, it&apos;s also been refreshed to match the "Material You design language."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:152.80%;"><img id="4zXg8pVPbRcvaMeZUX5SQc" name="redesigned-chrome-address-bar-tablets-render.png" alt="Redesigned address bar in Chrome for tablets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4zXg8pVPbRcvaMeZUX5SQc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="1528" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it might not be something you notice immediately, there&apos;s another handy trick. When tapping within the address bar, the current webpage that you&apos;re using will appear within the drop-down menu. Handy and useful, for sure, but we&apos;re still keeping our fingers crossed for the ability to move the address bar to the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Chrome Actions is probably a feature that you forget about even exists, but Google hasn&apos;t. Once the update arrives, shortcuts will appear below the search box as you type. Then, you can tap a button, as opposed to waiting for the search results to appear and trying to decipher the results.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:152.67%;"><img id="EA7ypbT8hwEN8LaqQbqWcc" name="updated-chrome-actions-render.png" alt="New Chrome Actions when performing a search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EA7ypbT8hwEN8LaqQbqWcc.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="2290" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.15%;"><img id="tsF9QZXm6Qtoc5SGLvntCc" name="google-chrome-shortcut-suggestions-update-render.png" alt="Suggestions shortcut in Google Chrome" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsF9QZXm6Qtoc5SGLvntCc.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1983" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Suggestions shortcut in Google Chrome </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Keeping with the idea of speeding things up, Google is adding a new "shortcut suggestions" feature to Chrome for Android and iOS. If there&apos;s something that you look up on a regular basis, the most pertinent results should now appear at the top of your suggestions.</p><p>The last two features further blur the line between Chrome and the standalone Google app. First, Google is bringing its "live sports cards" to the Discover Feed within the Chrome app. Based on the render provided, it&apos;s practically identical to what&apos;s found in the Discover Feed on your Android devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:171.01%;"><img id="74wBYUjyuxGKiSRgm2ujWc" name="sports-card-discover-feed-chrome-render.jpg" alt="Sports Cards appearing within Discover Feed on New Tab Page in Chrome" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/74wBYUjyuxGKiSRgm2ujWc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1352" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly is a feature that&apos;s already been available on Android, but is now coming to iOS. Once the update arrives, you&apos;ll now see a list of "Trending Searches" appear when tapping within the address bar "from the New Tab page."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:171.01%;"><img id="6JGXNfiCuXhdaH27c7KuHc" name="search-trends-in-chrome-on-ios.png" alt="Trending Searches in Chrome for iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6JGXNfiCuXhdaH27c7KuHc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1352" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can&apos;t help but feel as though Google might be moving away from the Discover Feed, as more features get integrated into the Chrome app. Perhaps that&apos;s in the cards, but, we&apos;re hopeful that isn&apos;t the case, even if it is a bit more convenient for those that practically live within the Chrome app.</p><p>All of these features are rolling out in some capacity starting now. The only exception is with the new Chrome Actions, as it&apos;s coming to Android first, and will be available on the iPhone "later this fall."</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube is testing a new feature that lets users take their favorite shorts with them, but it&apos;s only for Android viewers.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-shorts-smart-downloads-3454371/">Android Authority</a>, YouTube has kickstarted a test it calls "Shorts Smart Downloads." The company&apos;s experimental <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">lab notes</a> state that Premium users can have any recommended Shorts downloaded onto their device automatically.</p><p>YouTube adds users enrolled in the test, who head into their "You" tab and go down to "Smart Downloads." If you&apos;ve watched Shorts recently, the company states that you should see a few previously downloaded videos that you may enjoy.</p><p>This test is only available for YouTube Premium users on Android until July 15. Users must opt into it if they would like to test it.</p><p>The publication notes that YouTube conducted a test run of these Smart Downloads for Shorts back in April, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cc5yp9/how_to_disable_shorts_from_smart_downloads/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">detailed on Reddit</a>. Speculation suggests this was an early, limited experiment, and with feedback going well, YouTube likely extended it to gain a broader understanding.</p>

<p>With the latest Shorts test, it seems YouTube continues bringing more awareness to its short-form videos after plugging them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-show-you-shorts-in-more-places-on-the-web">into the sidebar</a>. YouTube announced that its short-form content generates over 70 billion views daily. As such, Shorts have made their way into the sidebar on the web and beneath videos on mobile. The carousel is filled with Shorts of a similar theme to the current video you&apos;re watching.</p><p>Another test, dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-is-testing-a-new-way-for-fans-to-show-some-love-to-their-favorite-channels">Hype</a>," lets users directly impact the length of their favorite video&apos;s reach across the platform. YouTube focuses on helping smaller creators reach larger audiences by installing Hype votes, letting viewers help adjust their content&apos;s ranking in the Explore tab.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube recently started testing its next phase in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-server-side-injectable-ads-test">war against ad blockers</a> with server-side ads. These advertisements are woven into the video a user would watch, effectively rendering their browser&apos;s ad blocker useless.</p>
