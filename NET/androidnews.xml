<p>We&apos;re expecting quite a stacked event this summer as Samsung prepares to debut the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>. The company showed off the device during MWC 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">and confirmed</a> some key specifications. Dr Hon Pak, head of the digital health team at Samsung informed the press that the Galaxy Ring&apos;s battery is estimated to last between "five and nine days."</p><p>A close-up of the Galaxy Ring highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ring-eyes-on-mwc-2024">its various finishes</a>, such as gold, platinum silver, and ceramic black. Samsung stated that it&apos;s strongly focused on tracking a user&apos;s fitness data through its first smart ring. The company also claimed that its wearable weighs roughly "half" of its competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, we&apos;re (not so) patiently awaiting the reveal of Samsung&apos;s next foldables: the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6. EVP and Head of R&D Mobile Experience, Won-Joon Choi, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-ai-experience-optimized-upcoming-foldable-teased">teased in June</a> that an "optimized" Galaxy AI experience will arrive for its clamshell and book-style devices. Samsung sees both devices as "versatile" and "flexible."</p><p>Specifics on what we could expect were kept quiet. However, Samsung&apos;s EVP stated that Galaxy AI&apos;s "Live Translate" will expand to third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a>. This could mean that those who frequent WhatsApp and Telegram could gain a Galaxy AI boost.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon is reportedly considering a paid tier for its Alexa voice assistant, which could cost between $5 and $10 per month. </li><li>The new AI assistant could be called “Remarkable Alexa” and feature enhanced artificial intelligence-based features.</li><li>Amazon would be joining the likes of Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI in asking consumers to pay a premium for AI software.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Artificial intelligence sparked a big period of investment in the technology following the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Companies want to spend money on research and development for AI to appease investors wanting to know what they’re doing to capitalize on the industry‘s latest buzzword. </p><p>Now that the investment period has been underway for well over a year for many companies, there’s one thing left to do, and that’s monetize it. And if you’ve been following the tech industry lately, companies have a clear preference for monetizing AI through subscriptions.</p><p>OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft already have paid subscriptions that provide exclusive features to those that pay extra. All three companies also have free versions that anyone can access without paying a cent. In ChatGPT’s case, without even creating an account. However, these companies all think their subscription services provide enough value to justify the extra monthly cost.</p><p>Amazon might be joining that list this year, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-mulls-5-10-monthly-price-tag-unprofitable-alexa-service-ai-revamp-2024-06-21/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> last week. The outlet says they spoke to multiple people with knowledge of the matter, and they shared Amazon’s possible plans to charge for a future version of Alexa. Like many of the companies and services listed above, there‘s a free version of Alexa that can be accessed through the app and with Echo smart speakers and displays. </p><p>Once again, Amazon is hoping that this new version of Alexa — dubbed “Remarkable Alexa,“ per the report, and supercharged with AI — will be worth paying for. Reuters says that Remarkable Alexa would cost a minimum of $5, but it could cost $10. Interestingly, Amazon isn’t considering bundling Remarkable Alexa with Amazon Prime. The company has taken this approach in the past, choosing to raise the price of Prime and add features rather than create multiple subscription services. </p><p>We don’t know a lot about what Remarkable Alexa will look like, and it could never see the light of day. However, in a 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2023-letter-to-shareholders" target="_blank">letter to shareholders</a>, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned Alexa as it relates to generative AI.</p><p>”We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business,” Jassy wrote. “These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant), to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), to customer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others.”</p><p>The report notes that Remarkable Alexa could order food for delivery or compose an email, which sounds a lot like what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit tried (and failed) to do with the R1</a> and its large action model (LAM). Regardless of what this new version of Alexa looks like, it’s hard to see how or why people would pay a monthly fee for it. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75" name="echo-dot-with-clock-4th-gen-1.jpg" alt="Echo Dot With Clock 4th Gen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Amazon does intend to proceed with this pricing model and strategy for Remarkable Alexa, it would be a big mistake. Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI all have niche features and top-of-the-line LLMs that justify the subscription costs for some users. Google has Android and Workspace integration, Microsoft has Windows and 365 integration, and OpenAI has the GPT Store and multimodal GPT-4o. For now, Amazon doesn’t have anything that comes close to those offerings, and Remarkable Alexa wouldn’t change that.</p><p>At the end of the day, Alexa is just a voice assistant. Amazon should be looking to what Apple is doing with Siri and Apple Intelligence instead of trying to mimic the subscription-based model of other companies. Apple isn’t charging for Apple Intelligence — every device that supports it will automatically get on-device processing, Private Cloud Compute processing, and ChatGPT outsourcing for free. </p><p>Apple isn’t charging for Apple Intelligence because it doesn’t need to. Apple Intelligence isn’t the product; the iPhone is the product — and all the AI features are just the means to the end, which is selling more iPhones. The same can be said about Apple Intelligence for iPad and Mac. </p><p>Amazon can and should copy this strategy. It could make Remarkable Alexa a truly competitive voice assistant with AI and use that to sell its own products. The company already has the Rufus chatbot to help users buy products on Amazon, and I’m sure that e-commerce will be a big part of Remarkable Alexa, too. But more than that, an enhanced Alexa could be paired with new hardware and Prime memberships to add value. </p><p>I’m never a fan of subscription price hikes, though I suspect Prime members would accept a $5 or $10 price increase because the plan still offers a lot of value. I’m not so sure how many Alexa users would pay that same $5 or $10 extra for a standalone Remarkable Alexa subscription.</p><p>Amazon is late to the AI party, and that comes with an advantage. It‘s starting to see what other companies have tried, what works, and what doesn’t. Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have all tried paid subscriptions, and their free versions are still much more popular. Meanwhile, the early opinions on Apple Intelligence seem to be overwhelmingly positive. </p><p>I wouldn‘t pay for an Alexa subscription, no matter the price or what features were included. And for that matter, I can’t think of <em>anyone</em> who would.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want to trade in your current smartwatch for something brand new; you&apos;re shopping for a smartwatch on a budget; you enjoy using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung smartwatches</a>.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you already use one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> and you don&apos;t want to downgrade; you want to avoid the hassle of a trade-in; you prefer using LTE smartwatches (only the Bluetooth version is available at this time). </p><p>Designed to be a "fan edition" watch, the Galaxy Watch FE packs loads of popular wearable features into a simple, budget-friendly device. You get deep health and fitness monitoring insights with all of the powerful sensors that made Galaxy watches so famous, plus a 1.2-inch Super AMOLED display, 100 pre-installed workout modes, and the same Sapphire Crystal Glass construction that goes into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>. </p><p>Now, as with all of Samsung&apos;s FE devices, it&apos;s important to remember that the Galaxy Watch FE isn&apos;t meant to be the most groundbreaking smartwatch on the planet. If you&apos;re looking for that, you&apos;d be better off purchasing the aforementioned Galaxy Watch 6 or Watch 6 Classic (or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>). But if you want a straightforward, brand-new device that won&apos;t break the bank, the Galaxy Watch FE is for you — <em>especially </em>if you can get it with a $100 discount. </p>

<hr>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 series will likely be released at next month&apos;s Unpacked event launch, which will likely happen on July 10, although Samsung needs to confirm it officially. Meanwhile, a Canadian Amazon listing has already revealed the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s pricing.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://passionategeekz.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-revealed-features-and-pricing-ahead-of-launch/">PassionateGeekz</a>, the said Amazon listing showcases the regular Galaxy Watch 7 Bluetooth variant featuring 40mm size and a price tag of CAD 358 (~$268). It further confirms that the smartwatch will feature a round-shaped display and sport at least 128GB of storage. It will be powered by a 3nm SoC that promises to boost power efficiency and carry out smoother all-round operations.</p>

<p>There is BioActiveSensor that carries out users&apos; health tracking features like heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen levels — during workouts, sleep with sleep quality analysis, and more. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> will also have the goodness of AI, and as the description points out, "Personalized Daily AI Companion for AI-Powered Sleep, Exercises, and communication." </p><p>Additionally, users also get to use the Galaxy AI smart reply, which can give reply suggestions when texting from the smartwatch. It also includes an AI-based tone suggestion for replies that lets users know how they sound while having a conversation.</p>
<p>Another crucial detail of the aforementioned Amazon listing is the availability of the Galaxy Watch 7 in Cream (probably one of the multiple color options). The smartwatch will be delivered as early as July 16, corroborating the earlier leak and reaffirming that the launch happened earlier than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> series.</p><p>The latest appearance follows the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fcc-listings-foreshadow-galaxy-watch-7-series-and-budget-galaxy-watch-fe">FCC listings</a> of the Galaxy Watch 7 series and the supposed Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-watch-7-ultra-specs-fcc-listing">FCC spotting</a>, which is all set to take on Apple Watch Ultra models.

<hr>
<p>A new report claims Netflix is thinking about debuting a new free variant of its streaming services but for a select few areas.</p><p>According to information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-23/netflix-s-advertising-challenge-it-isn-t-big-enough">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix has held internal discussions about debuting a free, ad-supported plan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-free-plan-3454100/">Android Authority</a>). If this happens, those "familiar" with the plan have stated it would apply to viewers in Europe and Asia. Rumors add that this plan could debut in large markets within those regions like Germany and Japan with "popular free TV networks."</p><p>This new plan reportedly deals with Netflix&apos;s scramble to find additional ways to "increase its audience."</p><p>However, the publication&apos;s sources claim that there are no plans to bring a plan of this capacity to U.S. consumers. Netflix "already reaches the majority of its potential customer base" in the region, thus making a move like this unnecessary.</p><p>The post highlights a similar move Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-free-plan-in-kenya">made in Kenya</a> in 2021 before discontinuing it. The most notable difference now is the addition of ads, as consumers in Kenya could watch shows and movies without them. The free plan offered personalized recommendations, parental controls, and profile creation options.</p><p>Sources add that these internal talks are still in their infancy, meaning things can go either way from here.</p><p>In other news, Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">detailed its plans for 2024</a>, which include a (definite) price hike despite achieving a record revenue quarter. It seems as though the company is seeking help from its customers to pay for its larger endeavors with streaming. Netflix&apos;s $5 billion deal with the WWE for the next 10 years was given as an example, alluding to a new trend moving forward.</p><p>Unfortunately, Netflix hasn&apos;t yet detailed the specifics of its impending price hike for 2024.</p><p>What is certain is that the company plans to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-highlights-smart-tv-home-screen-changes">a revamped UI</a> for smart TVs. During an interview with Netflix&apos;s senior director of products, Pat Flemming, it was confirmed that the new UI will help viewers see what&apos;s most important when scrolling over shows and movies. The new UI will place a quick preview, description, number of episodes, and more directly on the content card.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Gemini AI is now integrated into Gmail on both web and mobile platforms, offering AI-powered email assistance.</li><li>In the web version of Gmail, Gemini appears in a sidebar with suggestions like "Summarize this email," "List action items," and "Suggest a reply."</li><li>On mobile, a top button enables quick email summaries.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just announced that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a>, which offers AI-powered email assistance, is now available in Gmail on both the web and mobile apps.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-gmail.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google introduced a bunch of AI features for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a>. The big news is that the "Summarize this email" feature is now available on both iOS and Android. With Gemini&apos;s help, you can quickly shrink down long email threads or get help drafting replies. But Gemini is more than just a summarizer—it also lets you ask questions and dig up specific information from your inbox and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a> files.</p><p>Google has taken a big step forward by upgrading Gmail with its latest AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">Gemini 1.5 Pro</a>. This enhanced version comes with three major improvements: a significantly larger memory for context, a deeper understanding of information, and super-fast processing speeds.</p><p>In Gmail’s web version, Gemini appears in a sidebar on the right, next to your emails. This sidebar kicks things off with several handy suggestions like "Summarize this email," "List action items from this email," and "Suggest a reply to this email."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1546px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.37%;"><img id="FhiAmyKXcfzok4VxL4FXLK" name="gmail-ask-gemini-feature.png" alt="Gemini side panel in gmail on the web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FhiAmyKXcfzok4VxL4FXLK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1546" height="887" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the prompts are a great way to get started, Gemini’s real strength is in answering your direct questions. Don’t feel limited by the suggested options; you can have a natural conversation with Gemini and ask it anything about your emails.</p><p>The company is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-docs-sheets-slides-drive.html" target="_blank">expanding</a> the Gemini side panel to include Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive. In Docs, this handy tool will aid in polishing your prose, offering summaries, recommending tweaks, and creatively generating new content from your other files.</p><p>In Sheets, Gemini assists with creating tables, generating formulas, and explaining various functions step-by-step. In Slides, it can help you produce custom images and summarize presentations. Meanwhile, Drive can summarize multiple documents at once without opening them individually.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="HyWNUqjttnqHFQjc2JJiWc" name="Gmail-summarize-this-email.jpg" alt="Gemini summarize this email feature on gmail for android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HyWNUqjttnqHFQjc2JJiWc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="350" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, the mobile experience lacks a side panel, but a conveniently placed button at the top of your emails lets you quickly generate summaries. In the future, Gmail will offer contextual smart replies—one-tap responses tailored to your conversations. Plus, Gmail Q&A will soon allow you to find information within your emails using natural language queries.</p><p>Keep in mind that these advanced AI features are available to Google Workspace customers with specific subscription plans. If you have Google One AI Premium, the Gemini Business/Enterprise, or Gemini Education/Education Premium add-ons, you&apos;ll be able to use this functionality.</p>

<ul><li>Meta is working on a massive UI update for the Meta Quest line, allowing users to place windows anywhere in 3D space, as well as resize and reshape them.</li><li>The beta July v67 system update includes a new experimental feature for window management.</li><li>It's expected that Meta will launch the new major update in time for Connect 2024 and the Meta Quest 3s launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s almost July and you know what that means! A new Meta Quest update has begun rolling out to beta testers and it includes the new UI update that Meta teased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-mysterious-new-ui-ad">back at the end of May</a>.</p><p>The July v67 Meta Quest update includes a new experimental feature that lets users treat windows more like they were on a traditional desktop computer with the added advantage of moving them around in 3D space! Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1dnsdzi/quest_3_ptc_v67_new_windows_design/">on Reddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@lostinartmagic/post/C8ou8FlKSl0?xmt=AQGzHF-M7XxZ9Ziq_w4r0xcb1r-m0VQGfuEMlD-yLa-vPg">Threads</a> have already begun posting about it, showing off all the capabilities of the new experimental feature.</p><p>The update seems to add two major changes to window management. First, users can now launch apps in windowed mode and move them anywhere they want. Previously, only three apps could run at a time and would have to be snapped into one of three predetermined locations side-by-side, similar to a standard triple-monitor computer setup.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meta Quest OS v67 PTC has finally done it...🔗 https://t.co/L7i2lUWS8i 🔗 pic.twitter.com/rb7hBPS9lu<a href="https://twitter.com/Lunayian/status/1805434151111110805">June 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Now, windowed apps like the Quest browser, Threads, YouTube, and others can be moved around and placed anywhere. You can also move windows forward and backward in space, allowing windows to be placed in front of or behind one another. This works well for spacing windows around a room for a better mixed-reality setup.</p><p>The new UI now allows up to six apps to run at once: three pinned and three floating. Apps can be dragged to appear to be placed on walls, as well, giving them similarities to window management on Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>Windows can also be resized and reshaped in any way you like. Grabbing a window from the bottom right corner and dragging it out will resize it, allowing users to change not only the size of the window but also its shape. That means apps aren&apos;t confined to running in traditional "landscape" or "portrait" modes like a mobile app usually would.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to test the new features, you must be enrolled in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/using-your-headset/quest-ptc/">Meta Quest PTC</a> beta update channel. Once that&apos;s done, you&apos;ll eventually get the update when it rolls out to your headset. Meta updates headsets in waves, so not all users get the same update simultaneously. My Quest 3 still doesn&apos;t have the update despite being enrolled in the PTC group, so you may need to wait a while for it.</p>

<hr>
<p>It looks like we might see the Pixel 9 series earlier than ever, as Google has started sending out invites for its next Made by Google event. Next to the flagships, we could also see the Pixel Watch 3, Android 15&apos;s official rollout, and maybe the Pixel Fold 2. </p><p>Android Central and several others across the industry have started receiving emails from Google revealing the launch date of the Made by Google event. It will be held on August 13 (Tuesday) at Google headquarters in Mountain View. The accompanying keynote will begin at 10 AM PT, followed by a hands-on product experience.</p>

<p>The event coming a month early looks interesting because the usual timeframe of new flagship Pixel phones is generally not until fall every year. While it is still unclear why Google is choosing to come early, it is good to know we should be seeing some great Pixel product folio, which, as mentioned, can include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL (the new one in the lot), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, and new generation Pixel Buds, Pixel Fold, and a new Pixel Tablet are also expected at the event. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, which is currently in beta, might also have an early official rollout, as the Pixel 9 series would ship with it right out of the box. Similarly, the next version of Wear OS may also be early in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The invite sent out by the search giant also indicates that Made by Google will showcase “the best of Google AI, ” which could mean the Gemini advancements coming to the Pixel 9 series alongside the AI prowess for Pixel photography and post-edit features.</p><p>Since the launch date is now final, we should see more about the Pixel 9 lineup, particularly the new one, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which recently hit the benchmark test next to the regular Pixel 9. The launch also falls right after the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event, which is tentatively happening on July 10. Meanwhile, registrations for the Made by Google event will begin on July 31.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 24), Google announced that it&apos;s bringing its AI model Gemini to teen students and educators.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/ai-workspace-chromebook-iste-2024/">Keyword post</a>, the company detailed that "in the coming months," teens at the minimum age requirement (13) can chat with Gemini through their school account. Google states that Gemini&apos;s capabilities will be disabled by default, but school admins can enable it through the "Admin console."</p><p>Moreover, Gemini&apos;s services for teens in school will arrive as a free feature in "over 100 countries."</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/workspace-gemini-classroom-iste-2024/">subsequent post</a> states students using Gemini through a school account will experience safeguards to block inappropriate content. Google states Gemini will filter out "illegal or age-gated substances" from appearing in the results it delivers. Additionally, the AI will run a fact-check on a response when asked for the first time.</p><p>The AI will then encourage students to run the double-check function when asking a "fact-based" question.</p><p>Google is preparing to roll out a custom version of LearnLM called "Coach" for students. The feature is detailed as a step-by-step tool to help students build their knowledge of various subjects through quizzes and games.</p><p>A safer Google Chat is en route, with the company detailing that admins can soon restrict students from initiating DMs and creating spaces.</p>

<p>Google is also looking to bolster Read Along in Classrooms by implementing AI. The post states that educators will soon be able to assign reading activities to their students based on grade or phonics skills. With the help of AI, educators will gain insights about a student&apos;s "reading accuracy, speed, and comprehension."</p><p>Soon, Google hopes to bring AI-generated personalized stories for educators to give to their students. Those who&apos;re interested can sign up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3G74p3Htp5KMMTAEnNI4zKgcbrQNXgiZOhYWGxZUbOHBLLA/viewform">its pilot program</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-cloud-next-2024-gen-ai-announcements">Google Vids</a> is set to bring a generative AI-less variant for educators and students through Workspace for Education Plus "later this year."</p><p>Chromebooks and Workspace for Education will soon gain 16 new Classroom add-ons. These additions include Kami, Quizizz, Screencastify, Boom Learning, and more. The company is also bringing in a few more partners through its app licensing program, such as Canva, codeSpark, Equatio, Genially, Sora, and Sumo.</p><p>Google then reiterated its recent announcement of bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">Gemini to Chromebooks</a> and its Chromebook Plus. Consumers can expect a few features like Help Me Write, Generative AI Wallpaper, and Magic Editor in Google Photos. However, Google teases that "Read Aloud" is on its way for Chromebooks through the Chrome browser through the reading mode.</p>
