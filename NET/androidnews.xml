This also requires you to sign in to Google Messages with your Gmail acccount, which means some of your personal information is visible to whoever you text. If you want to limit who can see this information, here's a quick and easy way to manage your profile in Google Messages.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-manage-your-profile-in-google-messages-2">How to manage your profile in Google Messages</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong> in the upper, right-hand corner.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Your profile</strong> option.</p><p>4. You'll now be on the <strong>Customize how you are seen</strong> page.</p>

<p>5. If you wish to restrict who can see your profile photo, tap the <strong>camera symbol</strong> beside your photo. You can choose between <strong>Anyone </strong>or <strong>People that you interact with</strong>. The latter option includes interacting with others through other Google apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Save</strong> when you're done.</p><p>7. Go back to the main customization page.</p><p>8. Below your photo, you have the option to edit your name if you tap the <strong>Pencil symbol</strong>. Note that this will change your name across other Google services.</p><p>9. The last option, <strong>Show name and picture to, </strong>let's you control who can view your info. You can choose from <strong>People you message</strong>, <strong>Only your contacts</strong>, or <strong>No one</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The first option in Step 9 will let anyone view your info after you message them, even if they haven't saved your number. The second option will let others see your info only if they've saved your number. The last one will hide your profile info from anyone you message, irrespective of whether they have saved your number or not.</p>

<p>Android users finally get their own version of iMessage thanks to RCS messaging in Google Messages. Think of it as an equivalent to WhatsApp, Telegram, or any other rich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a> that you may use. This allows you to easily share media files like videos and photos, react to messages with emojis, see when the other person is typing or when your message has been read, and so on.</p><p>On supported smartphone devices, you even get GenAI models running on-device in the Messages app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages" target="_blank">Magic Compose,</a> for instance, is a feature using the Gemini Nano AI model that can automatically generate a set of responses based on the context of the chat.</p><p>All RCS chats between two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are end-to-end encrypted, which means all your data stays private. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">iPhone users finally got RCS</a> support with iOS 18, which allows for a similar texting experience between Android and iPhones. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that Android-iPhone RCS chats do not have end-to-end encryption yet, which is a bit of a security concern.</p>

It's a new mode available as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> following the December Pixel Feature drop. In essence, the option will change multiple accessibility settings at once to make your smartphone easier to use.</p><p>Simple View is a new feature, so you might be unsure what exactly it does. Luckily, we've put together this guide with everything you need to know about Simple View, including how to enable and use it.</p>
<h2 id="how-simple-view-works-on-pixel-phones-2">How Simple View works on Pixel phones</h2>
<p>Google added Simple View to Pixels with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-december-2024-feature-drop-announced">December Feature Drop</a>, and it's available as an accessibility option. The setting is a quick way to change many of your Android phone's accessibility features at the same time. Here's the full list of what Simple View changes on the Pixel Launcher:</p>
<ul><li>Larger text and icon sizes</li><li>Simplified Home screen layout</li><li>Simplified 3-button navigation buttons</li><li>Higher touch sensitivity</li><li>Contact, Clock, and Weather app shortcuts*</li><li>High-contrast wallpaper*</li><li>Increased App Grid to 4x4 display*</li><li>Suggested apps locked*</li></ul>
<p>*Only available when turning on Simple View from Pixel device setup.</p><p>Although Simple View changes many settings at once, it does not prevent you from changing them afterward. You can still make changes to your Pixel's display, layout, navigation, and font settings. Additionally, if you turn off Simple View, your phone's preferences will be reverted to their original ones.</p><p>Notably, the option isn't currently available for the Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or Pixel Tablet.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-on-simple-view-during-pixel-device-setup-2">How to turn on Simple View during Pixel device setup</h2>
<p>To get the full Simple View experience, you'll need to start from scratch by factory resetting your Pixel. The only way to get features like app shortcuts, a 4x4 app grid, a high-contrast wallpaper, and suggested apps locked is to enable Simple View during Pixel device setup. Note that factory resetting to turn on Simple View will erase all of your phone's data.</p><p>Once you've landed at the start of Pixel device setup, here's how to enable Simple View:</p><p>1. Turn on your Pixel phone. You should see the <strong>Welcome to your Pixel</strong> screen.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Set up with Simple View</strong>.</p><p>4. Flip the toggle beside <strong>Use Simple View</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-on-simple-view-after-pixel-device-setup-2">How to turn on Simple View after Pixel device setup</h2>
<p>You can also enable Simple View after setting up your device using the Settings app. However, not all Simple View changes will take effect. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Find the <strong>Quick Access</strong> section, then tap <strong>Simple View</strong>.</p><p>4. Flip the toggle next to <strong>Use Simple View</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Google Pixel devices are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and that's partly because they get exclusive features no other Android handsets get. Simple View is one of those features. If you have trouble using the default Android user interface or just want a simpler experience, Simple View could be the solution.</p>

Sameer Samat, president of the Google ecosystem, assured us that they "never stopped working on" XR despite these public failures and that the "Gemini era" means "the time is right for XR."</p><p>While Google <em>may</em> make Android XR hardware in the future, demos like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra's multimodal AI</a> may remain internal prototypes to focus on Android XR <em>software</em> for other brands — primarily Samsung — making XR devices.</p><p>Android XR may be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">most exciting version of Android in years</a>, but anyone unfamiliar with VR headsets or smart glasses may be confused about what Android XR <em>is</em> and what it's built to do. This guide will run through the basics of what to expect, from Samsung's Project Moohan to Google's XR plans for Gemini.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-android-xr"><span>What is Android XR?</span></h2>
<p>"Android eXtended Reality" is an Android spinoff platform that's designed for wearable devices, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> in that it's (A) co-designed with Samsung and (B) has to deliver efficient processing in a smaller form factor like glasses.</p><p>XR is a common industry term encompassing virtual, augmented, and mixed-reality devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">Smart glasses</a> don't typically fall under this umbrella since they have no reality-changing display, only audio; Google has included it, however, because it'll use the same baseline Gemini assistant as AR glasses.</p><p>Android XR software will underpin the XR headsets and glasses hardware, giving them access to Play Store apps that you won't get on other platforms — mainly Meta's Horizon OS on Quest.</p><p>The platform itself supports certain universal features like hand/controller tracking with external cameras or eye tracking with inward cameras — both enabling the kind of controls you see on the Apple Vision Pro. However, hardware developers will need to make devices that can take advantage of these tools.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> is "at the core" of Android XR, the company says. Whether it's a headset or glasses, it'll use sensors and cameras so that Gemini can "see what you see, whether it's digital or real content, hear what you hear, and react to your gestures alongside your voice."</p><p>With the conversationality of Gemini Live, paired with multimodal AI insights, Android XR will let you use natural voice commands to control the UI or ask contextual questions about what you're seeing, either in real life or in XR apps.</p><p>Outside of Gemini, Google has promised 360º videos on YouTube or Google TV, 3D Google Photos, Google Maps Immersive View, Google Meet, and Chrome with common AI tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

<p>Beyond Google apps, Android XR is compatible with both WebXR and OpenXR, the most common standards for web-based and native XR apps across the industry. That should mean many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> should port over to compatible Android XR headsets.</p><p>The Android XR SDK also supports Android Studio, ARCore, Jetpack Compose, and Unity. Any current Android apps will "just work" on Android XR (according to Google) as long as the developer opts in, though this will probably be a floating window in the "infinite desktop" virtual space; developers will want to optimize the app to the OS for any 3D visual effects. A few devs have already developed apps for Android XR with early access, including MLB, Calm, and Adobe.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/unlock-the-infinite-possibilities-of-xr-with-galaxy-ai">revealed</a> its XR headset, Project Moohan, at the same time as Google's Android XR; Moohan means "Infinity" in Korean, matching the theme. Samsung promises "state-of-the-art displays, Passthrough capabilities, and natural multi-modal input" but hasn't specified what specs it'll have when it launches to consumers in 2025.</p><p>We do know it'll use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a>, the chipset announced in January 2024 that supports up to 4.3K per eye, plus a 20% CPU boost and 15% GPU boost over the XR2 Gen 2 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. However, it's not guaranteed that Moohan will hit that resolution.</p><p>Based on the render above — plus private demos given to a few outlets — we know Samsung's XR headset will have a comfortable Elite-style strap, as well as a removable light shield for better immersion during VR experiences but less isolation during mixed-reality apps. It'll have outer IR cameras for tracking hands or controllers, plus inward cameras for eye tracking.</p><p>While Samsung has its own apps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> built off of Gemini, we believe Android XR (and Moohan) will default to Google apps and multimodal Gemini AI for commands and navigation, based on what we heard from Samsung.</p>

<p>Other Android XR hardware developers will likely choose the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 as well, given that Google partnered with Qualcomm and optimized the platform for its silicon. Google has confirmed that Xreal, Sony, and Lynx will develop Android XR devices.</p><p>At CES 2024, Sony <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">announced an XR headset</a> with the XR2+ Gen 2, 4K OLED micro-displays with pancake lenses that you can flip up like a visor, and 3D productivity software. It's the most likely candidate for Sony's Android XR device.</p><p>Xreal recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">spatial AR glasses</a> with up to 57-degree FoV and an add-on Xreal Eye Camera for capturing 1080p video and sending data to your phone for "multimodal AI." We don't think these glasses will support Android XR, but that camera sounds like the precursor to a newer version with Google software and Gemini built-in, with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> powering things.</p><p>Lynx, whose current XR headset has dealt with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/lynx-r1-production-an-absolute-mess/">delays and controversy</a>, will develop a new Android XR headset rather than update the R1, based on a statement made to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/sony-lynx-xreal-android-xr-devices/">UploadVR</a>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-google-make-an-android-xr-device"><span>Will Google make an Android XR device?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD" name="Google-IO-2024-AR-glasses.jpeg" alt="A screenshot from the Google I/O presentation showing a Google engineer wearing AR glasses with a camera and Gemini AI capabilities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A glimpse of Google's multimodal AI demo (and smart glasses) at Google I/O 2024 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is taking a backseat to Samsung in terms of releasing an actual Android XR device, focusing on software. At least for now!</p><p>In 2023, The Information reported on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">Google's XR prototypes</a>, including Project Moohan, a monocular Google Glass-lookalike codenamed "Betty," a two-display spin-off called "Barry," and an unnamed pair of smart glasses from former Magic Leap CTO Paul Greco and his team.</p><p>It's very possible that these devices are nothing more than prototypes developed to test Android XR, rather than anything planned for wide release. But Google did show off its own Android XR smart glasses demo to sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">The Verge</a> with multimodal AI capabilities, and it also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">showed a glimpse of these glasses at I/O 2024</a> (see the screenshot above).</p><p>It's <em>possible</em> that Google could join in on the Android XR fun, but it evidently wants to try and let its partners establish themselves first before cutting in on the action. It's similar to how Google co-developed the new version of Wear OS with Samsung in 2021 but didn't release its first Pixel Watch until late 2022.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os"><span>Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="u28GKqQBsoUfoH8M4RUFfK" name="meta-horizon-os-official-concept-work.jpg" alt="An official concept image of a potential Meta Horizon OS VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u28GKqQBsoUfoH8M4RUFfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta Horizon OS concept work </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest rival to Android XR will be Meta Horizon OS, the system behind Quest headsets. Meta is the most established brand in the XR space, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">tried to get Google to give Quest headsets Play Store access</a>, only for Google to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">insist that Meta use Android XR</a>, which Meta rebuffed.</p><p>Meta itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">made Meta Horizon OS open to partners</a> in 2024, announcing that Lenovo and ASUS ROG would make XR headsets with Meta software and apps. Meta and Xbox also plan to coordinate on a limited-edition headset.</p><p>Meta has a full library of games it can share with partners, as well as Meta AI. What it doesn't have is access to a Play Store full of apps and a development pipeline designed to convert phone apps into Android XR apps, like Google has; it has to use progressive web apps, and it's had very few productivity partners thus far.</p><p>Both platforms use Snapdragon chipsets, hand tracking, and UIs that float windows in virtual or mixed-reality space. Meta has its own popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>, and the promise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> in 2027, and they both use a similar interface to the Quest.</p><p>All of this is to say, Meta Horizon and Android XR have similar goals, methods, and devices. It's far too soon to say if Android XR will be better, worse, or a clone of Meta Horizon. What matters most is that Meta and Google will challenge one another, which ideally will lead to greater innovation in the XR space.</p>

Yes, 2024 was fun for those of us journalists covering consumer audio technology, and I hope that the work we’ve done has helped you have just as much fun — whether you’ve purchased any audio gear in 2024 based on something you’ve read here, or you’re just an enthusiast who enjoys reading about it.</p><p>In case you didn’t buy anything in 2024 and are looking to 2025 to be the year that you up your audio game, I’m going to explore where we’ve been in 2024 and how that has shaped what I want to see and, hopefully, what you’ll be able to buy in 2025. Let’s get into it!</p>

<h2 id="manufacturers-do-this-in-2025-2">Manufacturers! Do this in 2025…</h2>
<p>I’m a simple man. I can be easily entertained, so maybe this seems like it isn’t the grand, showy feature you were expecting but my favorite feature in 2024 that should be in every pair of earbuds in 2025 and beyond is offline voice control.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have the ability to control some basic but frequently used features of the earbuds with your voice <em>without having to use a wake word.</em> It’s just very natural and worked flawlessly for me when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review" target="_blank">I reviewed the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.</a> It’s basic, but for those of us out on a hike, working out in the gym, or cooking, this feature is priceless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-hero-closeup.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro on a desk with the lid open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a Star Trek nerd, the next feature I want to see in every premium pair of earbuds in 2025 comes from Samsung again, and that’s the Galaxy AI-driven live translation through the earbuds during phone calls. This feature allows you to speak to someone in English, for example, Galaxy AI will process that in the cloud, and then an AI voice will speak your words to them in their native language. This works bi-directionally.</p><p>There are purpose-built earbuds already on the market that specifically do live translations, similar to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and of course, you can already use Google Translate through other earbuds, including the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which isn't as seamless an experience. Still, the technology is there for Samsung's version of live translation of phone calls to be ubiquitous across pairs of major manufacturer buds at a certain price point.</p><p>Engage!</p>
<h2 id="sky-s-the-limit-2">Sky’s the limit!</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jixq34LZe6UvsLmpj74t7m" name="sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-AI-hero.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 in the cloud city" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jixq34LZe6UvsLmpj74t7m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With those two very practical favorites of mine out of the way, let’s talk open skies, big ideas, and technology that could make things better for those who need assistive technology.</p><p>Different manufacturers have their own flavor of audio sharing, and none of them work cross-platform. If you’re an Apple fan and want to watch a movie with a friend on a train, for example, you’ll need Apple or Beats earbuds, and they both need to support the <em>Share Audio</em> feature. Not all do—the same thing with Android. You’ll need compatible phones or earbuds for a feature like Samsung’s <em>Dual Audio</em>.</p><p>In 2020, Auracast was announced as a feature of the newer Bluetooth LE Audio standard, but it hasn’t yet seen wide adoption. We’ve written an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio" target="_blank">FAQ about Bluetooth LE</a> and even went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">hands-on with Auracast at IFA 2024</a>.</p><p>The nuts and bolts of it are that it is a technology that works similarly to traditional radio towers, but instead of broadcasting a signal to your car stereo’s FM radio, a single smartphone can send out a stream that multiple people’s Bluetooth earbuds or headphones can all listen in on.</p><p>Most importantly, this technology has a lot of interest in the hearing-impaired community as it could be baked right into hearing aids, overcoming some of those devices' limitations in receiving public address audio. And it wouldn't just be smartphones broadcasting, but TVs in gyms, airport gates, the refs and commentators at live football games, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2025, we may see much broader support for Auracast now that Google has baked it into the <em>Connected Devices</em> menu in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview</a>. Of all the audio technology I’m waiting on, this one is positioned to be the most profoundly impactful.</p><p>Everyone, from the hearing impaired to sports fans to those using public transportation, will benefit significantly from ubiquitous Auracast broadcast support in our smartphones and sound devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">And with excellent earbuds</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review" target="_blank">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</a> and the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 supporting Auracast</a>, this needs to happen post-haste.</p>
<h2 id="better-audio-for-all-2">Better audio for all</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wTErHkLtXmkHrW8pHywNwC" name="MTW4 audio codec displayed.png" alt="aptX codec on a Pixel 7 Pro, connected to a pair of Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTErHkLtXmkHrW8pHywNwC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While we're on the subject of Bluetooth codecs and technology, let's also address Hi-Res Audio.</p><p>High resolution is so much more immersive than the streaming files you’ll get from something like Spotify’s standard streams, so I’ve been watching eagerly as more wallet-friendly earbud and headphone options have emerged that support LDAC, LHDC, and aptX Lossless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="GS255FgwUqmuX4KUvzEzbB" name="spotify-wallpaper-fe0b.png" alt="Earbuds restiing on phone display, above the Spotify logo" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GS255FgwUqmuX4KUvzEzbB.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>As much as I love Tidal’s Max FLAC files and Apple’s ALAC files, the thing that will take public love of these highly engaging Bluetooth codecs to the next level is Spotify following through on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio">what it’s been telling us for years</a> at this point and delivering their Hi-Fi streaming option.</p><p>I wouldn’t wait for it at this point, but if I’m being completely honest, like Shakira’s hips, the numbers don’t lie. Spotify has over 30% of the global market share, with its closest competitor being Tencent Music out of China, with only 14%, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/653926/music-streaming-service-subscriber-share/"><u>Statista</u></a>. According to the site, Spotify has 252 million premium subscribers as of the third quarter of 2024, with 640 million total active monthly users globally.</p><p>The best part about making this happen in 2025 is that great earbuds like the Nothing Ear, EarFun Air Pro 4, and Liberty Pro 4 offer great hardware and sonic experiences with hi-res wireless Bluetooth codec support at prices non-audiophiles can afford.</p>

<h2 id="real-and-virtual-improvements-2">Real and virtual improvements</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8Z42ZNk7kBw483tteqmm9H" name="Meta-Quest-3-hero.jpg" alt="Wearing a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Z42ZNk7kBw483tteqmm9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Frankly, 2024 was phenomenal for us fitness enthusiasts who love the outdoors and want to push our limits to the beat of our favorite tunes. Open-ear audio took a huge leap forward with notable launches in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing’s Ear Open</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review" target="_blank">Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds.</a></p><p>The advance is bigger than that, though, with XR in the mix. Bluetooth earbuds are no good with XR platforms due to latency, so you need a dongle or USB-C headphones/earbuds to get synced audio. Some platforms like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> have open-ear speakers built into the frames, as do some newer AI glasses platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, and they’re pretty good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v2py6YMqJLAjZDsYEjAKEX" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-transparent-01" alt="Taking the transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses out of its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2py6YMqJLAjZDsYEjAKEX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing proved you can create open-ear earbuds with great bass response, and Ray-Ban did a solid job building immersive sound into the frames of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again" target="_blank">Meta smart glasses</a>, so in 2025, I think we’ll see a greater proliferation of open-ear audio in XR applications, smart glasses, and as standalone wearables, but we won’t be saying, “these sound great… for open-ear.”</p>

<h2 id="the-generative-generation-2">The “Generative Generation”</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="EbAZhSRPM7TnUqmNtLjZQo" name="audible-app-pixel-buds-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Audible App Pixel Buds Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EbAZhSRPM7TnUqmNtLjZQo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, with generative AI growing exponentially, we’ll see it a lot more in 2025. It’ll provide voiceover reads on websites if you want an article read to you (it’s already doing this), and it will be used by those in the audiobook industry to provide narration. But will it give me the emotion and uniqueness I get from human voice actors from various walks of life and backgrounds?</p><p>Is this the record vs CD debate all over again? The analog human voice with its warmth and texture vs the digitally generated voice? Time will tell, and I’ll be hesitant to embrace it, but I don’t think most people care too much and may not even notice the difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C" name="Gemini-2.0" alt="The Gemini 2.0 graphic provided by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of “generative AI,” we’ll see further integrations of the new wave of AI agents powered by ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini and Gemini Nano on mobile. Having reviewed Nothing and Google earbuds, which support both natively, in 2025, they’ll need to be more functional.</p><p>Right now, you can ask them questions, and you can have a really cool back-and-forth with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones" target="_blank">Gemini Live,</a> but it’s missing much of the functionality that Google Assistant has on mobile. I can have a running conversation with Gemini Live, asking it to point me to the best chili fries when I’m visiting Houston, TX, but when I’ve decided upon one of its recommendations, it won’t automatically launch Google Maps and take me to that establishment.</p>

<h2 id="bye-bye-android-auto-hello-subscriptions-2">Bye bye Android Auto! Hello subscriptions</h2>

We’ll turn everything into a subscription, including oxygen. Wanna breathe? Pay up!</em></p><p>Ok, that was a bit of hyperbole, but not that far off. Android Automotive OS is one of the main things I’m <em>not</em> looking forward to in 2025. Tesla and Rivian have already eschewed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and CarPlay connectivity, but the 2024 Chevy Blazer EV was GM's foray into telling the public they’re going another route as well, and they’d better get ready to pay up <em>after</em> the initial car purchase. That may mean that in addition to paying for your Tidal, Apple Music, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> subs, you’ll have to pay for a GM Android Automotive OS subscription to access your other subscriptions in the car.</p><p>The Blazer was just the beginning because that change is coming to all of GM's EVs.</p><p>GM integrated Android Automotive into the Blazer EV for “more advanced features,” but what it really wants is what it projects to be around $25 billion of additional revenue annually by 2030, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/what-carmakers-don-t-want-you-to-know-about-the-future-of-android-auto-and-carplay-243884.html" target="_blank">other car makers are taking notice, according to autoevolution.com.</a></p><p>What do you think about that? Would you pay to subscribe to an automotive OS so that you can have access to other things you already subscribe to built into your car without the need for a phone?</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What  you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android Auto rolls out fixes to earlier reported issues like Wi-Fi error messages and stuttering audio issues.</li><li>The rollout has begun over the past couple of weeks, and it is advisable for users to stay on the latest Android Auto v13.3.</li><li>The company is also working on current Android Auto issues reported from the latest Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto, in a recent community post, shared several new updates that it released this month, which will fix notable bugs that users have reported over the past few weeks.</p><p>The bugs include stuttering audio and Wi-Fi error messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-auto-update-addresses-wi-fi-bug-and-stuttering-audio/?taid=67662130068c530001b0bbb7&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a>). The company is also highlighting other bugs that it is working on, including those appearing for owners of devices like the latest Pixel 9 Pro. All sets of fixes and current bugs are shared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/97890637/android-auto-known-issues-updated-12-20-2024?hl=en-GB&sjid=7304505883262554186-AP">Android Auto community site</a>.</p>
<p>One of the notable fixes, per the community post, is an error message stating that the phone does not support 5GHz Wi-Fi connections. The support team has evidently fixed this and encourages users facing the issue to update to the latest Android Auto v13.3 version.</p><p>Similarly, some users had reported wireless audio stuttering (while playing music or maps) when connected to Android Auto, and the latest version of the app has also addressed this issue.</p><p>While these are some of the notable fixes the company has rolled out over the past couple of weeks, the support team has further acknowledged some of the known issues reported by users this month, which the team is believed to be working on.</p>
<p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> owner reported no audio being played through a music streaming service via Android Auto since installing the December 2024 Android 15 feature drop on their device. Owners of other Pixel devices have also chimed in with the same problems.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> users have been facing an Android Auto issue during calls, wherein the user is able to make and receive calls but is unable to hear audio. Lastly, some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> and 14T users who updated to Android 15-based Hyper OS 2.0 also reported issues about Android Auto not working properly after the update.</p>

<p>The Android Auto support team notes that these new bugs are currently on the verge of getting fixed, amongst others, and users can expect the fix to roll out in the coming weeks or months.</p><p>Aside from the aforementioned bugs, Android Auto is also working on bringing radio station features to the platform. Evidence relating to the feature has been seen in several instances over the past few months. Most recently, the latest beta version of the app was seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-latest-beta-teases-radio-station-feature-again">showcasing categories/music genres</a> of radio stations hidden under the app’s backend.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Starting with the OnePlus 3, OnePlus maintained a consistent design language. While the design of each subsequent phone changed, the overall aesthetic remained largely the same, with smooth curves and rounded edges characterized by a great in-hand feel. It's this familiarity combined with an obsessive focus on design that made using OnePlus phones enjoyable over the years. <br><br>After a decade, OnePlus is overhauling its design ethos with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/three-reasons-you-should-wait-for-the-oneplus-13-and-two-reasons-not-to">OnePlus 13</a>. Similar to most phones available today, the OnePlus 13 switches a boxier design, eschewing the flowing elegance of previous models. That said, the device comes with a vegan leather back (if you're getting the Midnight Ocean variant), and it looks highly interesting.<br><br>Ahead of the global launch, I talked to Ryan Ruan, head of OnePlus's Industrial Design Center, to get a better sense of the OnePlus 13's design and battery tech, and what the manufacturer is doing differently this time. The obvious starting point was the move to flat sides, and why OnePlus decided to alter the design. Ruan noted that OnePlus's design team "worked hard to make OnePlus 13 feel better in your hand than any other phone," investing a "significant amount of time in refining the transition between the front and back glass and the straight-edged frame" to deliver better durability and a device that still looks elegant. <br><br>Because OnePlus phones had dual-curved edges in the past, there was an increased chance of damage to the front or rear panes of glass if the device took a tumble and landed on an edge. Ruan said this was a point of contention with its users, and that OnePlus has been "continuously discussing and validating how to ensure a smooth overall curvature connection without compromising the device's drop resistance."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6o9zsFnrRY4rZ7bAewb855" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6o9zsFnrRY4rZ7bAewb855.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the OnePlus 13, Ruan said the goal was "for the transition surfaces to better conform to the natural curve of the user's palm while also providing a secure grip; to this end, we invested in the refinement and validation of nearly a hundred models" before settling on the final design for the OnePlus 13. <br><br>On the subject of durability, OnePlus says it decided to use a Microfiber Vegan Leather back to allow OnePlus 13 customers to use the device without a case. The vegan leather back is highly intriguing, as it uses a softer texture that hasn't been seen before on any phone. "We've fine-tuned the material composition and surface treatment to create an even more luxurious and durable texture that's also environmentally friendly," said Ruan. <br><br>"It's designed to offer a natural leather-like grip without compromising on style or sustainability. A lot of other leather-backed phones normally sacrifice the in-hand comfort just to guarantee daily durability. In the end, the leather may feel sort of plasticky (with a very rough texture). However, on the OnePlus 13, the microfiber vegan leather material is something we worked on for over a year; it guarantees good durability, and more importantly feels soft in your hand."<br><br>Ruan also stated that even though the Midnight Ocean model has a leather back, it doesn't interfere with wireless charging to any noticeable degree. "The thinness of the vegan leather back enables good proximity to the wireless charging coil, enhancing the charging efficiency. Meanwhile, the high-temperature resistance ensures that the phone can handle the slight increase in heat that can occur during wireless charging without any adverse effects."<br><br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:38.77%;"><img id="4FtPnBYygaNmLQwSTZLt25" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4FtPnBYygaNmLQwSTZLt25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has a flat AMOLED panel this time, but it includes 2.5D quad-curved edges with a "micro-curve ratio" that Ruan says will make a difference while using the device — at the same time negating accidental touches. Ruan said the micro-curve transition between the flat middle frame and the quad-curve glass ensures users don't get a sharp in-hand feeling, and guarantees a solid grip. "We chose to create a 2.5D screen which is designed to offer the visual appeal of a flat screen while also giving our users the smooth touch experience they get from a 3D screen."</p><p>Continuing with the in-hand feel, Ruan revealed that the OnePlus 13 has a 50:50 weight distribution, so even though it has a sizeable camera module, it isn't unwieldy to hold or use. "If you place your finger right under the OnePlus logo and support the phone, you'll find the phone doesn't lean towards one way or the other. That's because we introduce an evenly-split weight distribution. It requires our engineers to figure out a way to allocate more components in the lower half of the phone to balance the weight."<br><br>Another interesting tidbit is that OnePlus is eschewing Coring's Gorilla Glass in favor of a custom Ceramic Guard solution on the OnePlus 13, with Ruan stating that it delivers "superior drop protection and scratch resistance. It's reinforced with nano crystalline, a material that significantly enhances its fracture toughness. The result is that the OnePlus 13 display is twice as resistant to drops compared to conventional cover glass."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SyXETuNXqQFPi2Nec3Rb75" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXETuNXqQFPi2Nec3Rb75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the OnePlus 13 gets IP68 and IP69 resistance, with the latter designed to withstand high-pressure jets of water at up to 80 degrees Celsius. Interestingly, IP69 doesn't cover immersion in water, so manufacturers need to also have their devices tested for IP68 as well — that's why you see most 2025 phones having both IP68 and IP69. <br><br>One of the most exciting changes coming to 2025 phones is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon battery tech</a>, with most Chinese manufacturers using a silicon-carbon anode in their batteries to increase density and durability. The OnePlus 13 also has this tech, and the 6000mAh battery is dubbed OnePlus Silicon NanoStack. <br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's particularly interesting is that OnePlus is using a dual-cell configuration with the battery. Honor, OPPO, and Vivo use a single-cell battery on their devices, and by using two cells on the OnePlus 13, you get the best of both worlds — increased density, and fast 100W charging speeds. <br><br>Notably, the OnePlus 13 is using a 10% silicon-carbon anode, leading to an energy density of 805Wh/L, a heady 5.5% increase over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a>. That's why OnePlus is able to fit a bigger 6000mAh battery in the OnePlus 13 while still delivering a phone that's 10g lighter and 0.7mm thinner. <br><br>Ruan said the goal with the OnePlus 13 was to create a device with the best in-hand feel of any OnePlus phone to date, while ensuring it has better durability. Having used other devices that made a similar design transition — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> — in recent weeks, I'm excited to take a look at the OnePlus 13 and see if the manufacturer's claims actually hold up. I'll have much more to share about the OnePlus 13 as we head closer to the January 7 launch day, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>With just a few days to go until 2025, it's hard not to wonder what the future holds in store for accessories.</p><p>In the past, some of the most notable changes in the world of smartphone accessories have always been associated with the capabilities and characteristics of phones themselves. Revolutions in smartphones come and go, with record-breaking charging speeds and industry-shattering performance benchmarks met each year, and companion accessories come into play with these changes.</p><p>When it comes to accessories in 2025, I feel two main factors will reshape the landscape of the market: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tags/qi2">Qi2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Bluetooth Auracast</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2025-could-be-the-year-of-qi2-2">2025 could be the year of Qi2</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3716px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FUH6XoCW9usk5gsTBgQZAW" name="samsung-qi2-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Mock Qi2 MagSafe ring on a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUH6XoCW9usk5gsTBgQZAW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3716" height="2090" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, I've been harping on about Qi2 for a while. I honestly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-samsung-galaxy-s24-series">thought the Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> and the Google Pixel 9 lineup would be the first to take this leap. Of course, that did not happen. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a> turned out to be the first phone in the world to adopt the standard. There are no other Qi2-integrated Android phones at the moment; however, I haven't given up on Qi2 yet.</p><p>According to prominent tipster Ice Universe, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Samsung Galaxy S25 series will finally come with Qi2</a> wireless charging. As we discovered during our testing with the S24 Ultra, MagSafe cases and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">magnetic accessories interfere with S Pen functionality</a>, so if this S25 rumor is true, it would require a massive undertaking on Samsung's part. The brand would need to reengineer the device's internals to fix this.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">rumor from Suomimobiili</a>, a Finnish tech news website, alleges that the S25 series will adopt the Qi2 standard but in an unexpected way. Apparently, Samsung will offer MagSafe cases for the Galaxy S25 lineup. This could mean two things: either Samsung will bring Qi2 to the S25 series, or it hopes that a magnetic phone cover can bridge that gap and bring magnetic wireless charging to its phones without native Qi2 compatibility.</p><p>As the world's top seller of smartphones, Samsung has the resources to make this a reality. If anyone can bring about the wider adoption of a new standard, it would definitely be Samsung — or Google. And now that hundreds, if not thousands, of Qi2 accessories, are so widely available, it only makes sense to launch a Qi2 phone now.</p>
<h2 id="auracast-is-going-to-redefine-bluetooth-for-the-better-2">Auracast is going to redefine Bluetooth for the better</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKfNqooATWhxiWkQiTFH7a" name="Auracast-experience-sennheiser-app-IFA-2024.jpg" alt="Auracast on the Sennheiser app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKfNqooATWhxiWkQiTFH7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3838" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like Qi2, Bluetooth Auracast isn't a new standard. The feature enables users to transmit audio playback to multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously. There are so many incredible ways this audio broadcast system can be utilized. Think Spotify Jam but local, without the need to use a specific app or have any sort of subscription or internet connection. Our managing editor, Derrek Lee, tested it at IFA 2024 and described it as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024" target="_blank">Bluetooth's final form</a>" because it was that impressive.</p><p>The perfect example of how Auracast can be so useful would be at an airport or a public space. If you're listening to a podcast or streaming some music, you might miss important announcements. But with Bluetooth Auracast broadcasts, these announcements could be made directly to your earbuds.</p><p>I can think of so many other scenarios where this could be a lifesaver. Imagine being on a road trip with friends, but you're all in a bus, train, or maybe even a plane. You could all jam along to the same songs without disturbing other passengers via Auracast. It'd be like a private jam session or concert that no one else can hear.</p><p>Although it has been two and a half years since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">Bluetooth SIG announced Auracast</a>, a public launch is still pending. I am confident that we will see the first Auracast phones in 2025. As with Qi2, there are tons of Auracast-ready audio accessories available now. Big-name brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/marshall-emberton-iii-review" target="_blank">Marshall have started adding Bluetooth Auracast</a> support to their new releases, and even smaller brands like EarFun are joining in.</p>
<hr>
<p>With both Qi2 and Bluetooth Auracast looming on the horizon, 2025 is going to be a very interesting year. One thing's for sure: accessory makers are going to continue to make more and more products that support both features. Let's see whether my predictions about the widespread adoption of both Qi2 and Auracast come to pass.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Meta is rumored to launch an updated version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses with a display that’ll show notifications and Meta AI responses, expected in late 2025.</li><li>The current model lacks a visual display, relying on audio and phone integration, but the new version will include a built-in screen.</li><li>The new glasses will feature a small screen for notifications and responses, but won’t be a full mixed-reality device—Meta’s Orion AR glasses are aiming for that in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is reportedly preparing to launch an updated version of its Ray-Ban AR glasses with a display that’ll show notifications and replies from Meta AI.</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/77bd9117-0a2d-4bd7-9248-4dd288f695a4" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, Meta's new version of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> is expected to drop in the second half of 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/23/meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses-2025-report/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The current Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have a major downside: no visual feedback. Users can get audio responses from the digital assistant and view extra info on their phone, but the lack of a screen limits the overall experience. On the other hand, the upcoming third-gen model is expected to change that with a built-in display.</p><p>This move is right in line with Meta's grand plan to create lightweight, easy-to-wear devices that could eventually replace smartphones for everyday computing. The goal is a future where users can effortlessly access info, get things done faster, and interact with virtual assistants in a seamless, immersive way.</p><p>Sources close to Meta's plans say the new Ray-Ban smart glasses will feature a small screen mainly used for showing notifications and responses.</p><p>It’s pretty clear Meta isn’t aiming to make the new Ray-Ban smart glasses a full-on mixed-reality device. Toward that goal, the company is working on the Orion AR glasses, a slick prototype that’s still a few years away from being available to the public.</p><p>We’re not sure how adding a display in the line of sight will affect the design, but the current setup has its charm. It lets users capture photos and videos effortlessly, share them straight to Meta platforms, and enjoy audio through the built-in speakers.</p><p>Meta is focused on cementing its lead in the growing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses market</a>. With heavyweights like Apple and Google eyeing their own entry into the space, the competition is heating up. According to FT, Meta sees this new platform as the next big leap in tech, one that could eventually replace smartphones as the main way we interact with technology.</p><p>The Ray-Ban smart glasses have earned a lot of praise, and it’s no surprise. They look great, and with features like in-ear speakers, sharp cameras, and quick access to Meta’s virtual assistant, they deliver.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Drive now lets you watch videos instantly after uploading, ditching those annoying wait times.</li><li>While the update is great, you still have to wait for video processing before sharing.</li><li>The upgrade is available to Google Workspace users, individual subscribers, and personal account holders.</li><li>Right now, it’s live for Rapid Release domains, but everyone else will get it by January 2, 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Drive just rolled out a handy new feature that allows for instant video playback right after uploading on the web, so you can finally get rid of those frustrating wait times.</p><p>In a recent Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/release-notes-12-20-2024.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google announced that instant video playback on the web is now live. The company didn’t dive into the technical details, but it’s clear the changes work like a charm.</p><p>Before this update, uploading videos to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-drive-tips-and-tricks">Google Drive</a> meant waiting for them to go through a transcoding process. Basically, the videos had to be converted into a streaming-friendly format for Drive’s player. This step often took forever, leaving creators stuck waiting instead of diving right in.</p><p>From now on, you can start watching videos as soon as they’re done uploading to Google Drive.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">Cloud storage services</a> like Google Drive are built on a simple idea—upload files and get them back when you need them. But with the competition heating up, these services have evolved beyond the basics. Now, they come packed with nifty features like advanced sharing options.</p><p>Back in October, Google Drive rolled out an updated media player with auto-transcriptions and faster video loading. Now, with the new tweaks, the service is cutting down video loading delays even further.</p><p>Even with this improvement, it's not perfect yet. Users still have to wait for the video processing to finish before they can share their videos with others through Drive’s player.</p><p>Google has confirmed that this upgrade is available to a wide range of users, including all Google Workspace customers, individual Workspace subscribers, and personal Google account users.</p><p>Right now, the feature is available to users in the Rapid Release domains. But starting January 2, 2025, it’ll be rolled out to everyone else.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The OnePlus Open 2's launch keeps getting pushed back, with a late 2025 release now looking likely.</li><li>Initially, the delay was thought to be for Qualcomm’s latest chipset, but now it seems like unexpected development issues are causing the holdup.</li><li>The OnePlus Open 2 is expected to come with major upgrades, including a better rear camera, hardware, and a bigger battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> feels endless, and now it seems the launch might be pushed back even further, which is a bummer for anyone itching to see the next-gen foldable from OnePlus.</p><p>Tipster Sanju Choudhary claims on X that the OnePlus Open 2 might not hit store shelves until late 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_open_2_may_arrive_later_than_previously_rumored-news-65827.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Details are scarce, but it looks like fans of OnePlus’ foldables are in for a long wait.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The OnePlus OPEN 2 is 🔥 ....H2 2025..<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1870094317374640134">December 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Earlier reports suggested that the Open 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-may-have-a-launch-window-lined-up-for-its-next-foldable-phone">could debut as early as Q1 2025</a>, but that’s still far off from earlier speculations. At this point, a 2024 launch seems pretty much off the table.</p><p>At first, it seemed like the Open 2 was delayed to pack in Qualcomm’s latest chipset. But this new setback hints at unexpected development issues slowing things down even more.</p><p>These rumors are still up in the air until OnePlus makes it official. While the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> launched in October 2023, that doesn’t give us much to go on for its sequel. OnePlus’ release schedules can shift due to all kinds of factors, making past launches a shaky guide for what’s next.</p><p>The next OnePlus foldable is rumored to bring big upgrades to its rear camera and hardware, making the wait totally worth it.</p><p>Previous rumors suggested the Open 2 could be the first foldable in the U.S. to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, that is, if it drops in early 2025.</p><p>Reports also say the OnePlus Open 2 will pack an impressive battery, outdoing any foldable before it. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">expect a thinner design and better durability</a>, with the device being thinner and more water-resistant than the last one. These upgrades are definitely cranking up the hype.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oppo is expected to reveal the Find N5 next year, likely with the same hardware as the OnePlus Open 2. Given the parallel launch of the Find N3 and the original OnePlus Open last year, we could see both foldables debut around the same time in the next 12 months.</p>

<ul><li>Google has reportedly delivered its proposal to the DOJ's suggestion for it to sell off Chrome due to anti-competitive practices.</li><li>Seeing the DOJ's proposal as "extreme," Google suggests a better remedy would be to let other companies make "multiple" deals and choices available for users.</li><li>This all started after a landmark ruling claimed Google was an illegal search monopoly in July, thus provoking the DOJ's hand in forcing the selling of Chrome, Android, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The U.S. has continued to probe into Google's dominance with Chrome and a recent development sees the company rebuttal.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into Google's alleged anticompetitive practices with Chrome, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/2024.12.20_1108_Executive_Summary_of_Google_Proposed_Final_Judgment.pdf">a recent filing</a> expresses the company's disagreement with the government's proposal, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-21/google-blasts-chrome-sale-as-extreme-remedy-at-odds-with-law?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Google's vice president for regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/">stated that any sort of "remedy"</a> to the situation should involve letting other browsers have the freedom to "do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users." Additionally, Mulholland expressed Google's second browser agreement solution, which involves allowing the competition to leverage Search for both the user and their revenue.</p><p>Google states it seeks "flexibility" rather than the DOJ's proposal. As such, the company says its solution would allow for "multiple default agreements across different platforms." As an example, Google states Apple could provide a different search engine <em>and </em>browser on its iPhones and iPads. What's more, companies could swap their "default" every 12 months.</p><p>The solutions put forth by Google in its recent filing regard the DOJ's "extreme remedies." Of course, the company is referring to the U.S. government's suggestion for Google to sell Chrome. An excerpt from Google's document states, "...courts must take care to avoid decrees that “could wind up impairing rather than enhancing competition."</p><p>It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">reported in mid-November</a> that the Department of Justice and the presiding judge, Amit Mehta, have sought to force Google to sell Chrome for anti-competitive practices. This follows the government's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">landmark ruling</a> that the company broke Section 2 of the Sherman Act, turning it into an illegal search monopoly.</p><p>It's because of this that the DOJ is pushing Google to sell significant parts of its business — and Chrome, alongside Android, is wrapped in it. Regarding Chrome, government lawyers claim Google has "boxed out" the competition and has stifled rival incentives.</p><p>As Bloomberg notes, a final decision isn't on the table until August 2025 at the latest. However, if Google does have to sell Chrome, the internet will remain, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">but the players will change</a>.</p>

But did you know you can also add your passport to your digital wallet, creating an ID pass from it that you can use at various locations, including TSA checkpoints in the U.S., for domestic travel?

<h2 id="a-few-things-to-note-about-adding-your-passport-to-google-wallet-2">A few things to note about adding your passport to Google Wallet</h2>
<p>As noted, you will still need to bring your physical passport for travel since an ID pass is not a government-issued ID nor a replacement for your physical one. ID passes do not support international travel, but they should work with TSA security for domestic travel within the U.S. at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/digital-id/map" target="_blank">selected supported airports</a>.</p><p>Which airports does this include? See the list linked above, but note that this includes select locations within each state, such as the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, the Los Angeles International Airport in California, both John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York, and others.</p><p>The feature is also only available in the U.S. for now, but it’s possible we may see it expanded to other countries passports and locations in the future.</p><p>Users are required to have an Android phone with OS 9.0 or higher and must have Bluetooth and Nearby devices on in order for it to work. It’s crucial that you set a screen lock in order to use this feature as well, which is an added security measure.</p><p>You can’t link your passport to an existing ID pass on Google Wallet. You will need to create a new one. But once you do, you’ll love the convenience of having an ID that’s accepted in certain places to confirm your age and country of residence. The best part is that virtually all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> support Google Wallet.</p><p>Finally, if you decide you no longer want to have a digital version of your passport in Google Wallet, select your ID pass in Google Wallet, select More (the three vertical dots), and select Remove and Remove again. You can also do this remotely at <strong>myaccount.google.com</strong>. Go to your Personal Info, select IDs, Manage IDs, find and select the passport, select Delete, and then confirm the deletion a second time.</p>

For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-id-support-in-yet-another-us-state">people in select states</a>, adding your driver's license or state ID to Google Wallet can be yet another way to slim down or eliminate your physical wallet. After adding an ID card to Wallet, you can speed up your TSA security checks at certain airports in the U.S.</p><p>However, if you're new to the idea of digital IDs, the process of adding a state ID or driver's license to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> might seem daunting. In this guide, we'll review everything you need to know about digital IDs, and tell you how to get started.</p>
<h2 id="which-states-support-digital-ids-in-google-wallet-2">Which states support digital IDs in Google Wallet?</h2>
<p>A few years after the first state announced Google Wallet support for IDs, there are still only six states that support it:</p>
<ul><li>Arizona</li><li>California</li><li>Colorado</li><li>Georgia</li><li>Maryland</li><li>New Mexico</li></ul>
<p>Currently, driver's licenses and state IDs have limited uses. Most states require ID holders to carry their physical card on them in addition to their Google Wallet digital ID. While some states and businesses support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet" target="_blank">Google Wallet</a> digital IDs for age and identity verification, the most common use for the passes is for getting through TSA checkpoints in airports.</p><p>Not every airport supports Google Wallet, and for a list of those that do, check out Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12436402?hl=en">support page</a>.</p>
<p>TSA guidance changes regularly, and you can check the most up-to-date information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/when-will-phased-digital-id-rollout-start-which-airportsstates" target="_blank">here</a>. The agency also recommends Google Wallet users follow airport signage at checkpoints to confirm digital IDs will be accepted.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-add-a-driver-s-license-or-state-id-to-the-wallet-app-2">How to add a driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app</h2>
<p>If you have an ID from one of the supported states, you can add it to Google Wallet using the steps below. Be sure to have your physical card handy.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Wallet app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Add to Wallet</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>ID</strong> from the list.</p><p>4. Choose <strong>Driver's license or state ID</strong>.</p><p>5. Press the button corresponding to the <strong>state that issued your ID</strong>.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Get Started</strong>.</p>

<p>7. Follow the <strong>on-screen prompts</strong> to continue setup. The exact process will depend on your state, but you'll need to scan your physical license for verification.</p>

<p>After you've finished, you'll be able to use your digital ID in Google Wallet as your state and federal laws allow. That includes at select TSA checkpoints, and for certain age and identity verification situations in select states.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-state-ids-in-google-wallet-2">Everything else you need to know about state IDs in Google Wallet</h2>
<p>Before leaving the house, know that most jurisdictions require you to carry your physical card in addition to your Google Wallet digital ID. Additionally, you must be using a phone running Android 9 or higher with <strong>Bluetooth and nearby devices</strong> enabled. You can only save the same digital ID to one device, so choose wisely if you have multiple Android devices. Finally, digital IDs are considered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-support-for-california-ids-alongside-apple-wallet">private passes in Google Wallet</a> and are encrypted, but your information is shared with the issuing agency the first time you set it up.</p><p>With all that in mind, you'll be all set to start using your driver's license and digital IDs in Google Wallet.</p><p>Meanwhile, did you know that Google Wallet lets you create an ID pass using your passport?

It's incredibly frustrating, but foldable phones like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold have a unique advantage with features like Made You Look.</p><p>Google wasn't the first company to implement such a feature, as Motorola has a similar feature called "Camera Cartoon" on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. It's one of the benefits of having a foldable phone with an external display, and we couldn't be happier to see Made You Look make its debut on Google's 2024 flagship foldable.</p>

<p>There are a couple of limitations when using Made You Look on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. While it seems that Google understands how beneficial such a feature can be, the implementation is a bit odd.</p><p>When enabling Made You Look, instead of taking advantage of any of the three main cameras, it instead relies on the Cover Screen's 10MP selfie camera. This is rather disappointing to see, as we miss out on the better quality of the higher resolution cameras that are also pointing at the subject.</p><p>The next of which is that you are limited to either a 1x or 1.4x zoom when taking photos, which means that you'll need to be able to get closer to the subject than normal.</p><p>Coming as a bit less of a surprise, another limitation is that you are unable to use Made You Look if you are recording video. In fact, you aren't able to use this feature with any other Camera modes on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> or 9 Pro Fold.</p>

<p>There are times when a company includes a feature with a new phone that flies under the radar. Made You Look feels like it falls under that category, especially for those who might not have a need to make sure a little one is actually looking at the camera.</p><p>However, if you're on the other side of the fence and understand the frustrations, then you'll appreciate how helpful things like this can be. Now, we can only hope to see seemingly trivial features make their way onto more and more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in the future.</p>

<ul><li>A database discovery shed light on Nothing's three upcoming phones: the Phone 3a, Phone 3a Plus, and the CMF Phone 2.</li><li>The 3a was detailed with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, a drop in selfie camera recording capabilities, and a lack of RAW file support.</li><li>The Phone 3, which is now slated for a 2025 debut, was spotted in a Geekbench database with the same Qualcomm chip and 8GB of RAM.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Past rumors have claimed Nothing is working on three phones to join the Phone 3 and it seems a leak might hold some clues.</p><p>Tucked within the IMEI database is information that points toward what these devices could be, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-nothings-2025-surprise-three-new-smartphones-on-the-horizon/">SmartPrix</a>. According to its post, the publication discovered the following model numbers: A059, A059P, and A001. It's stated that these names concern the Phone 3a, Phone 3a Plus, and the CMF Phone 2, respectively.</p><p>The information available in the database seemingly details the Nothing Phone 3a's camera specs. Codenamed "asteroids" (like the retro game), the device could sport a selfie camera with 1080p recording at 30fps and a focal length of 29mm.</p><p>The publication notes that the recording frame rate is a significant drop from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a's</a> 60fps capabilities.</p><p>Regarding its primary sensor, the database highlights a lack of RAW file support, a 26mm lens, 4K resolution video capabilities at 60fps, and Slow-Mo support "up to 480fps at 1080p." The post adds that (likely) the rear cameras will feature "Super Macro," "Super EIS" (electronic image stabilization), and "Super Night Modes."</p><p>The Phone 3a is also supposedly listed with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> SoC.</p><p>Specs concerning the Phone 3a Plus weren't detailed; however, it will likely remain similar to the base 3a. Elsewhere, the publication states its findings show the CMF Phone 2 could rock the same SoC as the 3a.</p>

<p>We're already waiting on the flagship Phone 3 from Nothing; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-rumored-to-have-three-phones-in-active-development-as-we-await-phone-3">a recent rumor suggested</a> we have more on the way. What was said in November (sort of) doubles down on what the recent IMEI database listing details. That old rumor claimed we were waiting on a Nothing Phone 3a and a "Phone 3a Pro," which has seemingly swapped into the 3a Plus.</p><p>Those older rumors lacked specifications; however, it claimed consumers could see these devices during H1 2025, which is the first half of next year.</p><p>Elsewhere, a report in November allegedly spotted the Nothing Phone 3a with a rather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">budget-friendly chip</a>. The phone was noticed in a Geekbench database with the same chip SmartPrix discovered for the others: the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC. Early specifications were there but only alluded to 8GB of RAM and Android 15.</p><p>We're also expecting the Phone 3 — and perhaps the 3a and 3 Plus — to go in heavily on AI, at least that's what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">Nothing's CEO Carl Pei wants</a>. Pei teased the company's planned AI enhancements in June as it was "prototyping AI interactions." It was made evident that the Phone 3's planned 2024 launch was delayed purposefully so Nothing could continue crafting its AI software.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly making changes to its mobile phone focus as we head into the new year.</p><p>A recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20241222000037">EtNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung will cut its number of produced foldable phones next year "significantly." The publication cites "industry sources" in stating that the 2024 models, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a>, underperformed after debuting this summer. The number of pre-orders for these models also saw a reduction if you were to compare the Flip 5/Fold 5 to today's devices.</p><p>The Korean OEM is still expected to move ahead with its foldables; however, the report states it might only produce 3 million Flip 7's and 2 million Fold 7's. Combined, this comes out to a total of 5 million 2025 foldable models which, according to the publication, it a ~3 million total reduction compared to 2024.</p><p>There must be balance and it seems that what Samsung takes away from its foldables will be placed into its slab phones, the Galaxy S25 series. The publication's sources claim the next series could see a ~7% increase in produced models. Samsung's "target shipment" is supposedly around 37.4 million S25 units, which contrasts with its previous 35 million goal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">the S24</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, the report highlights the highly anticipated Galaxy "S25 Slim," which could grab a whopping 3 million units.</p>

<p>While it seems like these rumors came from left field, an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-lower-pre-order-numbers">report in July shed light</a> on the Flip 6/Fold 6's underwhelming pre-order performance. The previous 5 series models were a smash hit as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">Samsung shattered records</a> with those models, achieving a total of 1.02 million pre-ordered units. Fast-forward to 2024 and those numbers dipped to 910,000 foldable units in South Korea. The stats say it was a 10% drop, but the Flip 6 was still the most popular as it accounted for 60% of those totals.</p><p>Samsung's Head of Mobile, TM Roh, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discussed-foldable-sale-estimates-2024">said shortly after Unpacked</a> that he wanted to boost the company's foldable shipments by 10% in 2024. It seems that those ambitions were met by a rocky road, as rumors now point toward an overall reduction in 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, previous rumors state Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-parts-orders-production-report">is going all in</a> on the Galaxy S25 as it looks to top last year's success. These suspicions come from the company's "supply orders," which showed that it was looking to produce roughly 30 million S25 phones by the end of 2025. Rumors now are painting a slightly "better" picture than what was stated in October as those numbers have climbed by ~7 million units.</p><p>More importantly, 2025 could look <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/2025-could-be-very-different-for-google-and-samsung-heres-why">very different for Samsung</a> — and also Google. The struggling Flip 6 and Fold 6 are a standout, but also its "successful" Galaxy S24 — namely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">the S24 Plus</a> — didn't <em>really </em>help its profits. Samsung Electronics' DS Division, Jeon Young-hyun <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">did apologize</a> publically for the company's lack of innovation and "vowed" to make changes moving forward.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-to-come-on-january-22-2025-leaked-image-suggests">leaked imagery</a> might've clued us into the January 22 launch of the Galaxy S25 series.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Ring currently sticks to a few limited sizes. But rumor has it the company is gearing up to offer more options, making it easier for everyone to find their perfect fit.</p><p>A tip to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-14-15-tdra/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a> suggests Samsung might soon add sizes 14 and 15 for the next-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, catching up with the size variety offered by other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">top smart rings</a> out there.</p><p>A Samsung user guide shared by 91mobiles lists nine Galaxy Ring models, from SM-Q500 to SM-Q509, covering the current sizes. Interestingly, it also mentions two new models—SM-Q514 and SM-Q515. While the guide doesn’t spill more details, these models match certifications from NEMKO, a Norwegian group known for its electronic safety testing.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard this. Reports over the past few months <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-more-sizes-rumor">have hinted at Samsung’s plans to add two more Galaxy Ring sizes</a>.</p><p>More recently, leaker Max Jambor said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-expansion-january-rumors">Samsung is set to launch sizes 14 and 15 for the Galaxy Ring in January</a>. It’s solid proof backing up the rumors about expanding size options.</p><p>The upcoming size 14 is rumored to have an inner diameter of 23mm, while the Size 15 model will be a bit roomier at 23.8mm. Both new sizes are expected to weigh 3.2 grams, a bit heavier than the current sizes, which range from 2.3 to 3.0 grams.</p><p>Jambor previously revealed that Galaxy Ring sizes 14 and 15 would be labeled as SM-Q514 and SM-Q515. Backing this up, the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) just certified these models, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/20/samsung-galaxy-ring-sizes-qi-listings/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> spotting them in WPC’s online <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/21687" target="_blank">database</a>.</p><p>Expanding size options for the Galaxy Ring is a big move for Samsung in the cutthroat smart ring market. Oura, the leader in this space, has a strong grip on the market with a loyal following, setting the bar high.</p><p>To challenge Oura, Samsung can’t just copy what it's doing—it has to one-up the competition in features and user experience. Matching Oura’s size range is a key first step. By offering a better fit for more people, Samsung can make the Galaxy Ring more appealing and attract a bigger crowd.</p>

For the past few years, tech companies have been ramping up AI development — and you could argue that everyone has been trying to catch OpenAI. Still, it feels like no one has figured out the "killer app" for AI just yet. The year 2024 can be characterized by the tech industry putting AI absolutely everywhere it could, trying to figure out what would stick.</p><p>The new year will mark a significant shift, and the way consumers interact with AI in 2025 is poised to change. Currently, you need to go out of your way to use it. Loading up the ChatGPT website or calling upon the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> assistant is necessary to converse with AI helpers. Next year, that likely won't be the case. AI will be baked into the operating systems and software you use and will become capable enough that it'll expectedly start doing things completely on your behalf.</p><p>The end of this year has brought a few glimpses of what's to come in 2025. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra is being tested by people outside of Google</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a> is the first operating system built with Gemini at the core, and Apple Intelligence is now available with ChatGPT integration.</p><p>We don't have to guess what AI will bring in 2025 — tech companies and their executives have already laid out many of their plans. There are still questions to answer, though. Which companies can actually deliver on their promises, how will they change how we use mobile devices and wearables, and what privacy implications will these shifts have?</p>

<h2 id="ai-will-become-the-heart-of-mobile-operating-systems-2">AI will become the heart of mobile operating systems</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4sUeciYBZHaLoMa5KiYw7h" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-20.jpg" alt="Gemini response on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4sUeciYBZHaLoMa5KiYw7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Up until now, artificial intelligence has powered many individual features and apps. Some have been widely successful — OpenAI reported ChatGPT had 200 million weekly users as of August 2024 — and others less so. Gemini, for example, was downloaded about 780,000 times in September 2024, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1454331/united-states-chatgpt-gemini-app-downloads/" target="_blank">Statista</a>. The number for ChatGPT? That would be 4.2 million downloads in the same month, despite the ChatGPT app already being available on iOS and Android for more than a year.</p><p>Meanwhile, hardware devices created with AI at their center have definitively failed, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> and Humane AI Pin are two key examples from this year. Specifically, the Rabbit R1 was a tiny AI device that touted a "Large Action Model" that could take actions on your behalf. Asking the Rabbit R1 to play a song would require it to use Spotify for you, and ordering food would have Rabbit literally use a DoorDash client on a remote server for you.</p><p>The reason these devices failed is because, well, people already have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great phones</a>. They're more powerful and better suited for AI tasks than specialized hardware devices. In 2025, these mainstream devices will become more akin to the failed AI products. The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin both aim to use AI to complete tasks for you, and soon, your smartphones, tablets, and wearables will do the same.</p><p>Rabbit's failed idea regarding the LAM is what Google and others are trying to do right with agentic AI models.</p><p>"Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision," said Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">in a blog post announcing Gemini 2.0</a>. "With new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant."</p><p>What does that look like? It depends on the company. Google is building Project Astra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">a multimodal AI helper</a> that I tried at Google I/O 2024. It's able to take in your surroundings and use external sources to process queries and then respond with multimodal output. For example, you might ask a question verbally with Project Astra using a camera or a search engine to gain proper context. Then, it can respond with written text, a generated image, or spoken word — or a combination of the above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ" name="google-project-astra-storytelling.jpg" alt="Demoing Google Project Astra's vision capabilities at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though Project Astra is only being tested through Google's "trusted tester program," the company has shown off the software on phones, glasses, and headsets. It also announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a>, a brand-new operating system for headsets and wearables with Gemini at the core. It's safe to say that Project Astra will arrive on hardware next year, and that could include Pixel phones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">an unreleased Samsung headset</a>.</p><p>Separately, Google has Project Mariner, a research prototype that will literally browse Chrome for you in the works. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI</a> already has multimodal support on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a>, and Apple has Visual Intelligence on iOS 18.2. Last but not least, OpenAI has ChatGPT-4o, a multimodal assistant much like Project Astra.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIIlJt8JERI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>There's something that all these features have in common: they will all become deeply integrated with smartphone, tablet, and wearable operating systems. When available, Project Astra will all but certainly debut on Pixel hardware in 2025. Similarly, ChatGPT-4o is available now on iOS 18.2 since Apple Intelligence features ChatGPT integration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="izRDpXyLHvMSK4czXRSrDi" name="ios-18-chatgpt" alt="ChatGPT integration in iOS 18." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izRDpXyLHvMSK4czXRSrDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChatGPT is available system-wide in iOS 18.2, since you can invoke it anywhere with Siri. That's just like how Android users can set Gemini as their default assistant. Additionally, Apple Intelligence's Writing Tools are available anywhere you can access the keyboard. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">Samsung will follow suit</a> with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">One UI 7</a>.</p><p>So, two things are going to happen with AI in 2025. On one hand, AI services like Project Astra, ChatGPT-4o, and Visual Intelligence will use multimodal processing and actions to control your mobile devices for you. On the other, smaller AI features will be ingrained into the operating system, so you won't have to go to individual apps to access services like Gemini or ChatGPT.</p><p>Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318444/google-gemini-2-0-flash-ai-model" target="_blank">The Verge</a> in an interview: "We really see 2025 as the true start of the agent-based era."</p>

<h2 id="google-apple-openai-and-others-will-compete-to-build-the-best-models-2">Google, Apple, OpenAI, and others will compete to build the best models</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8" name="OpenAI-GPT4o-Announcement.jpg" alt="The announcement of GPT-4o." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the key unknowns for AI in 2025 is whether progress is destined to stall. Some experts believe that AI progress was achieved so quickly in 2023 and 2024 that it is bound to plateau in 2025. Top executives have, on occasion, acknowledged a potential slowdown. However, they're united against the idea of a "wall" or that we've reached the limits of AI progress for now.</p><p>"When you start out quickly scaling up, you can throw more compute, and you can make a lot of progress, but you definitely are going to need deeper breakthroughs as we go to the next stage," Pichai said at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/events/dealbook/sessions/sundar-pichai-building-the-future" target="_blank">Dealbook Summit</a> earlier this month. "So you can perceive it as there's a wall, or there's some small barriers."</p><p>In one of his classic cryptic posts on X (formerly Twitter), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed a similar sentiment, saying, "There is no wall."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">there is no wall<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1856941766915641580">November 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Regardless of whether there will or won't be a slowdown, companies like Apple, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google will all be vying to build the fastest and most efficient AI models. While companies such as Google have vastly improved their AI models, OpenAI's headstart and ChatGPT's brand recognition have been significant hurdles for competitors. Even if other companies are better than OpenAI, users might not care enough to switch.</p><p>They'll also be navigating uncharted legal waters as the government and society decide what's up for grabs in terms of AI training material. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> is just one example of an entity currently suing OpenAI for what it alleges is a breach of copyright law.</p><p>Many of these cases are currently ongoing, and we can expect some to come to a head in 2025. Additionally, it's only a matter of time before more governments and regulators try to institute safeguards and protections around AI development and use.</p>
<h2 id="ai-privacy-and-safeguards-will-be-something-to-watch-in-2025-2">AI privacy and safeguards will be something to watch in 2025</h2>
<p>Finally, we'll end our preview of AI in 2025 with a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-must-balance-ai-features-with-privacy">what types of privacy efforts and safeguards will be put in place</a> next year. Unfortunately, I think the lines may become blurred as to what is public and private when it comes to AI.</p><p>Apple Intelligence is commonly referred to as the industry standard for AI privacy — the company developed custom Private Cloud Compute servers that run a hardened OS, and Apple dares hackers to try and crack it. If they do, there's up to a million-dollar reward.</p><p>The problem is that there are three types of security levels baked into Apple Intelligence. Some tasks run on-device using the NPU inside Apple silicon chips, and others are outsourced to Apple's Private Cloud Compute servers. You won't know whether an Apple Intelligence task is running on-device or not. That's up to Apple, and you have to trust it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck" name="apple-intelligence-ios-18.png" alt="Apple Intelligence examples on iPhone running iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, there's ChatGPT integration, which Apple views separately from Apple Intelligence — there are some privacy protections for users, but their requests are still shared with OpenAI, even if they aren't stored. If you link your ChatGPT account with iOS 18, something that's required to use ChatGPT Plus and Pro, you agree to OpenAI's privacy policies, not Apple's.</p><p>In 2025, I think there will be so many AI features baked into our essential devices that it'll be impossible to truly think about the privacy policies and safeguards for each. It'll be akin to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-connect-2024-new-ai-features-privacy-concerns">agreeing to the "terms and conditions"</a> before setting up a new device. We'll have to trust that AI companies are acting in our best interests. The only way we'll know that companies aren't living up to their promises is when they inevitably fall short.</p>

That said, 2024 has proven that both companies still have what it takes to make a splash in the North American smartphone market, and 2025 could be the time when both companies shine.</p><p>Motorola and OnePlus took very different approaches with their launches this year, with varying degrees of success. On the one hand, there was a sense of focus and restraint, with products offering improvements that finally give us the impression that Motorola and OnePlus are finally on the right track. On the other hand, both companies fell short in ways that would make them truly stand out among juggernauts like Samsung and Chinese OEMs.</p><p>If they want to succeed in 2025, neither can rest on their laurels and will have to maintain their momentum to get more devices in more hands.</p>

<p>In recent years, Motorola has been seen as little more than a budget option for consumers, launching low-cost phones that compete with Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">A-series devices</a> on both specs and price. Given how prominent smartphone carriers are in North America, consumers will often gravitate toward iPhones, Galaxy phones, and even Pixels.</p><p>Still, that carrier relationship has been quite important for Motorola, and it has helped the company secure a solid spot as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/">a top OEM in North America</a>, among other regions around the world, as noted by Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research.</p><p>“Moto has been focusing heavily on prepaid channels with some good traction for G & Edge series [and] some good promos for Razr 2024 [series] in postpaid at T-Mobile and AT&T,” Shah explained in an interview, noting that Latin America has been a stronghold for the company, especially with its budget models.</p><p>A Motorola phone is a safe bet for anyone looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, and they have proven that they can bring plenty of value at lower prices.</p><p>“What has worked for Moto in markets outside USA (especially India) has been focused on CMF (Colors, Materials and Finish) in partnership with Pantone helping it differentiate among the sea of blacks and got the positioning and partnerships right. That is key as well in North America,” Shah notes.</p><p>However, Shah points out that the company still struggles in the higher-end and premium segments where Samsung rules. This is where the Razr series comes in. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">I reviewed the Razr Plus 2024</a> earlier this year and came away extremely impressed with it, even after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">I pitted it against</a> the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>There’s no doubt that Motorola will focus its efforts on the Razr series in 2025, especially after Lenovo announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-stealing-away-iphone-users">its mobile business is set to double by 2026</a>, thanks to its flagship lineups. Motorola’s marketing efforts for the Razr series have also paid off, with the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">targeting the younger Gen Z and the older millennials</a> who yearn for the nostalgia of a flip phone and something other than an iPhone.</p><p>The question is whether or not Motorola can keep it up in 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="pEASxtK2JCHbPBEaLFXnJ4" name="Moto-AI-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024.jpg" alt="A Motorola executive showcasing Moto AI on stage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEASxtK2JCHbPBEaLFXnJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4156" height="2338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola can’t rely solely on the Razr series, particularly in the U.S., where there is a swathe of high-end Samsung phones to choose from and when consumers are unsure about foldable phones. Motorola’s closest premium non-foldable phone is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Edge 2024</a>, which was a little underwhelming compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Edge Plus 2023</a>. And while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">Edge 50 Ultra</a> was among the more impressive phones to launch this year, it never arrived in the U.S., leaving plenty of room for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> to eat up plenty of the premium market share.</p><p>Shah notes that Motorola “is particularly still quite weak in [the] $500+ wholesale premium segment,” and with the growing popularity of the Razr series, Motorola can use the momentum around its name to launch a premium Edge model in North America to challenge Samsung’s dominance, especially if it can get the phone on carrier shelves.</p><p>Of course, if Motorola wants a fighting chance, it’ll have to do more than put a nice new phone on the shelves, according to Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.</p><p>While Ubrani agrees that Motorola has well-rounded phones with incredible value, he notes that “the reality is that they don’t have any notable standout features or points of differentiation and often fall below other brands when it comes to some smartphone basics such as photography.”</p><p>Ubrani suggests that Motorola should offer improved photo and video capture on its phones, something the company hasn’t particularly excelled in. Perhaps the company should consider a partnership like what we've seen with other Android OEMs. OnePlus's partnership with Hasselblad has resulted in impressive camera quality on its recent devices, and Motorola could benefit from a similar collaboration.</p><p>AI could also play a huge role for Motorola in 2025. The company is already beta-testing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite with features that summarize notifications, transcribe recordings, and recall saved content. It also showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model</a>, which performs actions in apps on the user’s behalf, such as ordering a coffee or Uber. Motorola hasn’t said when this will arrive on phones, but with the recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a>, this can’t be too far off, and I could imagine this launching in 2025.</p><p>Of course, this is all contingent on whether Motorola can avoid having its phones banned in the U.S. The company is currently in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-phones-could-be-banned-in-the-us-what-would-that-mean-for-the-market">patent infringement dispute</a> with Ericsson that could ban its devices in several countries, so hopefully, Lenovo can work things out to avoid a move that would be pretty detrimental to the market.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS" name="oneplus-12-with-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-background" alt="The green OnePlus 12 in front of a grey Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike Motorola, which has seen an uptick in the adoption of its flagship phones, OnePlus has struggled to get its phones into consumer hands. The company launched the rather impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> earlier this year, which I recently had the pleasure of using.</p><p>Thanks to the multi-year partnership with Hasselblad, OnePlus has managed to develop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">a camera system that could rival Samsung and even Google</a>, and the company was even among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-just-made-2024s-best-phone-even-better">first to bring Android 15 to its smartphones</a> in 2024, something even Samsung hasn’t managed to do.</p><p>However, none of that matters if no one’s buying the phone, and OnePlus has been absent from the rankings for top OEM shipments for 2024.</p><p>That said, both Shah and Ubrani agree that there is an overall positive perception of the company. So why is that not translating into sales, especially in North America, which is a major market? Ubrani tells me that the issue isn’t with OnePlus.</p><p>“The issue is the state of the U.S. smartphone market and the fact that telcos act as gatekeepers. When OnePlus first started, they eschewed the telcos by going direct-to-consumer, and though it worked well, they were still a very tiny player. They eventually began to work with American telcos, but this proved to be too expensive, and they eventually backed away.</p><p>The reality is that the unlocked piece of the U.S. smartphone market is tiny (sub 10%), and unless brands are willing to spend large sums of money to work with telcos, they don’t stand a chance. I doubt we’ll see much of OnePlus in the U.S. as a result of this.”</p><p>OnePlus could take a page from Motorola’s book regarding carrier partnerships in 2025. The last major OnePlus phone to be sold through a U.S. carrier was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-10-pro-review">OnePlus 10 Pro</a>, and even that was limited to T-Mobile. Since then, anyone who wanted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a> had to buy it straight from the company or unlocked from a retailer. In the U.S., this makes it incredibly difficult to move a significant number of units, even with the cheaper and more accessible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>.</p><p>Shah also points out that despite OnePlus’s attractive portfolio, the $300-$600 price point that it targets in the U.S. “is barely 5% of the total market, which reduces its Total Addressable Market for OnePlus to compete.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY" name="oneplus-13-official-01" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, with the upcoming launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, there is some hope. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-the-oneplus-13-global-launch-date">global launch is on January 7</a>, and the phone should prove quite impressive based on what we’ve seen from the Chinese variant. It’s unclear if OnePlus’s carrier relationships will get better, but Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, seems optimistic.</p><p>“I think OnePlus is doing about as well as they expect to in the U.S. market without in-store carrier support. That said, I do believe that the next generation of devices are really good, and I've been surprised by the quality of the products across the brand and I think they should do a better job of exposing themselves to consumers with their accessories like the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 which are among my favorite earbuds.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 sets the stage for the next generation and I think we'll see some interesting things from them next month.”</p><p>Additionally, OnePlus has done a good job expanding its product portfolio, launching the mighty impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a> along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. This is something we would like to see Motorola do more of in 2025, as the company doesn’t currently have a branded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a>. OnePlus may not have a huge U.S. presence, but Motorola’s growing popularity could benefit from an expanded portfolio and a more realized family of devices à la Samsung’s Galaxy lineup.</p><p>One product we hope to see in 2025 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">OnePlus Open 2</a>, especially after we came away so impressed by the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. The company skipped a launch in 2024, so this could be the year OnePlus really challenges Samsung and Google, but that depends on its ability to get it into consumer's hands.</p>
<hr>
<p>Aside from OnePlus and Motorola, other smaller companies like TCL, HMD Global, and Nothing are still clawing for market share in the U.S., with TCL having the best prospects among them. That said, despite launching unique and affordable products in 2024, the lack of strong carrier relationships will likely make it hard to grow in 2025.</p><p>Motorola’s willingness to play the game with carriers has solidified its place as a top-selling player, teetering between the budget and premium segments where it can compete with both the smaller and bigger players. Because of this, 2025 could be a big year for Motorola if it continues to play its cards right, but others, like OnePlus, will likely struggle to make any significant headway.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to be rolling out "Ask about this PDF" feature for Gemini Advanced users.</li><li>The feature initially announced at Google I/O is now official for Gemini Advanced users running Android 15.</li><li>It allows users to ask questions about the PDF, which is accessed via Files by Google app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Early this year at Google I/O, the search giant announced several new features for its AI assistant Gemini. One such nifty feature is “Ask this PDF” for Gemini Advanced users, which is finally seeing a wider rollout.</p><p>As noted by Mishaal Rahman in his recent Threads post, the feature appears to be widely available for Gemini Advanced users. The “Ask about this PDF” feature primarily allows Gemini to give you answers regarding the document when invoked on your Android phone.</p>

<p>For instance, by opening a PDF file from the Files by Google app and triggering Gemini within the app, users can now see a new “Ask about this PDF” option right above the Gemini floating window. Tapping the option would allow them to ask questions about the document and its contents.</p><p>The feature was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">announced</a> earlier at Google IO and is now starting to appear for Gemini Advanced users running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> versions. Rahman also notes that users need to set Gemini as their Assistant on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> to use this feature flawlessly. The primary aim of this feature is to save you time from scrolling through multiple pages, particularly if the PDFs have many pages..</p>
<p>Analyzing PDFs isn’t entirely new, as files stored in Google Drive can easily be analyzed with the help of the Gemini extension in the respective app. The integration can analyze and summarize based on the contents of the PDF file.</p><p>However, the new “Ask about this PDF” feature can be helpful for locally stored PDF files on your phone when accessed through the Files by Google app, which also recently got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-has-a-new-pdf-viewer-and-its-ditching-google-drive">new PDF viewer upgrade</a>.</p><p>Instead of the previous Google Drive integration, it is a new document viewer specific to the Files app. The new PDF viewer in the Files by Google app allows users to easily share, star, and take actions while viewing the PDF with a new interface.</p><p>Both new features might enhance the document viewing experience, making it quite convenient for Android 15 users relying on Google’s AI assistant.</p>

Google soared to the top, managing to have one of its largest lineup of devices launch in the fall and a successful year with expanding Gemini.

<p>As I said earlier, Google had a great year. The company became a strong competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT by launching Gemini in more countries and, by the end of the year, launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advance</a> for Gemini Advance subscribers.</p><p>It successfully rolled out stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and even launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 developer preview</a> much earlier than usual. In the fall, Google launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> along with other products, and in the time I’ve been covering technology, it was the biggest launch of products I’ve ever seen Google do.</p><p>However, Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, says it’s hard to tell whether the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini AI</a> on its Pixel 9 series of phones has helped with sales.</p><p>“[The] Gemini AI effect has yet to be seen fully to boost Google Pixel sales, however, it is definitely one of the key hooks in coming years for Google Pixel to bring flagship Gen AI experiences on the Pixel hardware,” he notes.</p><p>I would agree; I don’t think we’re at a point yet where people are buying a phone because of its AI capabilities. I don’t think there are enough features or average enough use case scenarios where people are using AI daily, and I believe people don’t know enough about AI.</p><p>That being said, one of my favorite features, and in my opinion, the best feature Google came out with this year, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. It is hands down the most innovative feature and one that I actively use on a daily basis. But apart from that, I really haven’t been using many of Gemini’s features on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, agrees and adds that Google needs to focus on innovating Gemini for more general features.</p><p>“Google’s constant iteration and use of user feedback along with improvements in distribution and pricing along with increased marketing spend have helped the company gain share in the past few years. Having differentiating features such as great photography, call screening, Magic Eraser, and other AI features have helped along the way,” he says.</p><p>Ubrani adds that in 2025, he’d also like to see Google expand Gemini across all platforms and devices, not just smartphones. This is something that I hope Google prioritizes next year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UhiNDbDr8dST2K2seUpFSU" name="google-gemini-iphone-launch-hero-wide" alt="Google's Gemini debuts its dedicated app on iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UhiNDbDr8dST2K2seUpFSU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, Google also launched one of the biggest suites of products that I’ve ever seen a company do in a long time. More importantly, it launched the Pixel 9 series with Gemini integrated into it.</p><p>I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 series is one of Google's best phone launches</a>. While I had no issues with the phone, there can always be improvements, according to Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy.</p><p>“Google needs to improve the Pixel battery life, by moving to advanced nodes and using the best processors. The same goes for Wi-Fi connectivity and 5G, I was really disappointed how much of a downgrade the Pixel was on connectivity from my S24 Ultra,” he said.</p><p>And Google is likely planning to address this issue with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">rumors indicating that the Pixel 10 </a>lineup will have the Tensor G5. Google has also allegedly finished its design and sent it along for manufacturing at TSMC, ending the era of Samsung-produced designs. TSMC tends to manufacture better chipsets than Samsung. For reference, Qualcomm used Samsung to produce the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, a processor that was infamous for overheating and heavy throttling.</p><p>So, for all we know, the issue surrounding a slower battery might be resolved, making the Pixel 10 lineup an even more premium device.</p><p>I know Google will have a smooth 2025, but I just hope that when it comes to AI, it is really able to push the average consumer and help them understand how to use AI safely and efficiently daily.</p>

<p>It is widely known that Samsung bears the hat of having the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> and is constantly the leader in the Android space. However, this past year, the company faced several challenges despite starting the year strong by launching its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 series of phones</a>.</p><p>But while the S24 was a great series, it didn’t really help improve the downward trajectory of Samsung’s sales. In April 2024, Samsung initiated a six-day workweek for executives to create "a sense of crisis" among the company's leadership team.</p><p>Where Samsung began to really struggle was after launching its Samsung Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a>, which in many tech circles was more of an iterative update to what it launched last year. The phones weren’t super exciting and weren’t as innovative as they have been in previous years.</p><p>Samsung noticed this to the point where, for the first time, Samsung Electronics' DS Division, Jeon Young-hyun, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">issued a rare apology</a> for the company's failure to innovate. He acknowledged that outsiders are viewing the company's current situation as a "crisis" and vowed to make changes and improvements that will benefit investors, customers, and employees alike.</p><p>It came to a point where other companies were even mocking the release of the Z Fold 6 and how thick it was, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">like Honor engraving a tiny</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold"> "</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">world's smallest apology"</a> on the hinge of a special-edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a>.</p>

<p>IDC also confirmed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share">Samsung had lost smartphone market share</a> as of Q2 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. The research firm also stated that while Samsung moved over 53 million smartphone units in the second quarter, its market share dipped to 18.4 percent, down from 20% in the same period last year. This comes at a time when other China-based brands like Xiaomi and Vivo have been innovating and expanding their market share.</p><p>Ubrani says, “Samsung has rested on their laurels for far too long, and it’s starting to catch up to them. Most Chinese smartphone brands have outengineered and out innovated them in recent years when it comes to things like foldables, battery life, gaming performance, cameras, etc."</p><p>For the longest time, Samsung has focused on competition with Apple when globally they’re competing with many more brands. To be successful, Samsung needs to realize that there’s more than just Apple. Samsung should leverage their scale to iterate faster and continue to invest in marketing like they used to do so during the pre-pandemic era.”</p><p>Shah also notes that the launch of the S and A series helped keep Samsung afloat, but if it wants to get its numbers back up, it needs to focus on innovating its foldables.</p><p>“The foldables performance has been disappointing, which [offset] the good traction for S and A series this year,” he said. “Samsung will have to protect its foldable leadership position as players such as Google, OnePlus and others are coming up with better form-factors. Designs and camera performance.”</p><p>I think Samsung is fine; it is not the type of company to fail, and it knows when to fix itself; case in point, the public apology. However, I do think that Samsung needs to stay focused on itself and not constantly look at what other companies are doing. Yes, to stay in the game, you need to see what others are doing, but looking too much will distract you.</p><p>Sag agrees, adding that Samsung needs to stop looking at what Apple is doing to innovate because its customers don’t care about Apple.</p><p>“Samsung needs to lean into what makes Android fun and exciting, people are not really switching between Android and iOS (Razr+ excepted). Samsung needs to figure out how to execute Galaxy AI in a more meaningful manner and get back its reputation as the carrier of the Android banner,” he said.</p><p>I would wholeheartedly agree that Samsung needs to remind its users why it’s the best innovator and why it was the first to introduce foldables and excite its users again.</p><p>I’ve been covering technology for many years, and 2024 has been a fascinating year for both Google and Samsung. I expect a lot from both companies in 2025, and I can’t wait to see how they innovate more.</p>

<hr>
<p>MediaTek’s Dimensity 8400 is here to shake up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone segment</a>. The big twist is that it scraps the usual "little" cores this time around.</p><p>The Dimensity 8400 goes all-in with an "All Big Core" CPU design, ditching the usual mix for eight high-power Arm Cortex-A725 cores clocked at 3.25GHz. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-8300-announced">Compared to the Dimensity 8300</a>, this shift delivers a massive 41% bump in multi-core performance, as per MediaTek. Even better, it pulls off this power move while cutting peak energy use by 44%.</p><p>This design mirrors what we’ve seen in flagship Android chips, which have also ditched low-power cores. What makes it groundbreaking, though, is that it’s the first mid-range processor to embrace this bold design.</p><p>Backing up the CPU is a strong Neural Processing Unit (NPU) built to speed up Generative AI tasks. On top of that, MediaTek’s Dimensity Agentic AI Engine (DAE) takes regular AI apps to the next level, turning them into smarter, autonomous systems. This means the chipset predicts your device’s power needs, optimizing performance before you even notice a slow-down.</p><p>The Dimensity 8400 also packs a powerhouse GPU with the Arm Mali-G720 MC7, a big step up from the Mali-G615 MC6. MediaTek says this upgrade delivers a 24% boost in peak performance and a 42% jump in power efficiency. With extras like MediaTek’s Frame Rate Converter and Adaptive Gaming Technology 3.0, the Dimensity 8400 clearly wants to dominate mobile gaming.</p><p>Powered by the NPU 880, the chipset is built to handle large language models, making it capable of creating awesome media and giving smart, context-aware responses.</p><p>The Dimensity 8400 comes with a top-tier imaging system, led by the MediaTek Imagiq 1080 ISP. With remosaic tech, it captures more light, speeds up autofocus, and shoots super-sharp, high-res photos.</p><p>It also supports HDR video recording across the full zoom range, so you can capture footage with amazing dynamic range.</p><p>For connectivity, the Dimensity 8400 packs a 5G-Advanced modem with up to 3CC-CA, offering peak download speeds of 5.17 Gbps.</p><p>And when it comes to displays, this chipset supports WQHD+ screens with up to 144Hz refresh rates, plus dual-screen support for better multitasking and productivity.</p><p>The first phones with the Dimensity 8400 should hit by the end of 2024, but you'll mostly see it in 2025 models.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google TV already has a solid lineup of free channels with plenty of variety for all kinds of viewers. But knowing we can never get enough content, the platform has added even more. With this update, US viewers now have access to over 170 free channels.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/21/google-tv-free-channels-holidays-2024/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this update should now be live for anyone with a TV or streaming device running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> software. You’ll find the expanded channel lineup right in the Google TV Freeplay app.</p><p>Freeplay gives you instant access to free, ad-supported live channels as soon as you set up a new Google TV device. However, it’s only available in the U.S. for now.</p><p>Google TV’s latest channel drop builds on a recent expansion. Just a few months back, the platform added 14 new channels, bumping the total to 150.</p><p>The new channels are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Designated Survivor</li><li>Places & Spaces – The Great Christmas Light Fight</li><li>Best of Dr Phil</li><li>Xumo Free Holiday Movie Channel</li><li>Xumo Free Holiday Classics</li><li>Xumo Christian Christmas</li><li>Continuum</li><li>Z Nation</li><li>The Design Network</li><li>Filmrise: Classic TV</li><li>UFC</li><li>Unbeaten</li><li>Big 12 Studios</li><li>Waypoint TV</li><li>PursuitUP</li><li>Stingray Greatest Holiday Hits</li><li>Stingray Soul Storm Christmas</li><li>Stingray Hot Country Christmas</li></ul>
<p>The latest update boosts Google TV Freeplay’s channel count to 171. However, 9to5Google points out that some channels might only stick around for the holidays, judging by their festive names.</p><p>Alongside this expansion, MotorTrend Fast TV has quietly disappeared. This constant shuffle of adding and dropping content is expected to continue through 2025, keeping the streaming scene as unpredictable as ever.</p><p>Google TV kicked things off with 80 free channels when it launched ad-supported TV in early 2023. By the end of the year, that number climbed to 117. Last August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-is-cranking-up-the-content-with-a-fresh-batch-of-free-channels">it hit 136</a>, and September brought 14 more to the party.</p><p>Accessing these channels is super easy. Just head to the 'Live' tab, scroll through your recommendations, or use the Google TV channel player to jump right in.</p>

<p>As we say farewell to a 2024 filled with new smartwatches, smart rings, and other fun wearables, I'm using my year's experience as Wearables lead for Android Central — and insights from key wearable analysts — to predict what 2025 has in store for us as smartwatch fans.</p><p>We had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-2024-retrospective-theyre-getting-shockingly-good">very strong year for smartwatches in 2024</a>, but some trends, like an increased focus on AI insights and better health tools on mainstream smartwatches, were half-baked. They were the precursor to what should be a greater push in these areas with the next generation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>, Apple Watches, and other wearables.</p><p>Below, I'll break down the surefire predictions, likely possibilities, and wishful guesswork for smartwatch, smart ring, and smart glasses trends in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="a-wider-range-of-smartwatches-especially-flagships-2">A wider range of smartwatches, especially flagships</h2>
<p>Garmin was one of the first to get away with selling a smartwatch that costs as much as a smartphone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix series</a>, but Apple brought that idea into the mainstream with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Ultra series</a>, and then Samsung happily followed Apple's lead and ditched its mid-tier Classics and Pros for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. In 2025, look for more brands to start testing loyal users' willingness to spend more on pricier status-symbol smartwatches, says Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.</p><p>"Samsung (thanks to Apple) kicked off the Ultra tier, and we expect more vendors to also launch higher-priced models," he predicts. That could mean a Pixel Watch Ultra, OnePlus Watch Ultra, or a titanium TicWatch. And that could easily apply to other fitness brands that have typically tried to undercut Apple/Galaxy Watch prices.</p><p>At the same time, Ubrani also thinks the inverse is true: We're going to see "more options for more consumers," especially thrifty watch buyers. The Galaxy Watch FE and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> started that trend this year, and we could see even more budget or mid-level watches with strategic downgrades next year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C" name="Gemini-2.0" alt="The Gemini 2.0 graphic provided by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I already brought up this point in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-expect-from-android-and-wear-os-smartwatches-in-2025">Wear OS 2025 predictions column</a>, but I suspect that Apple, Google, and Samsung will shove their big-name AIs into smartwatches in 2025 with the same urgency and eagerness as they did with phones this year. That means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives">Bixby AI</a>) on Android watches and Apple Intelligence on Apple Watches, in some form.</p><p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees in principle that AI will become "the connective fabric between all of our wearables," from watches and earbuds to rings and glasses. "Apple Intelligence and Gemini will be big drivers, but so will Meta AI and possibly even ChatGPT."</p><p>However, he also cautioned that he thinks Google "still needs to figure out a way to get Gemini to run smoothly on such performance-limited hardware," noting that it "could come with RISC-V or some other more capable platform."</p><p>He's particularly excited about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V</a>'s potential for Android watches, saying "the payoff could be huge" for its custom chips. But even if new chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> have more compute power, the tokens needed for a conversational LLM may simply be too much for the watch form factor right now, and RISC-V itself could "take a bit longer" to arrive.</p><p>Ubrani seemed to agree that "AI will make a splash [in 2025], though this may not exclusively be on-device." Instead, just like we got cloud-based AI analysis like Samsung Health's Energy Score and Wellness Tips in 2024, we'll see "more personalized experiences" for health and fitness in 2025.</p>

<h2 id="smartwatches-will-become-even-more-of-a-mobile-doctor-s-appointment-2">Smartwatches will become even more of a mobile doctor's appointment</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ" name="google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse.jpg" alt="The Pixel Watch 3 is the first Google device to feature the Loss of Pulse feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1900" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You know how much data smartwatches can track already, from heart health and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">sleep apnea</a> to skin temperature and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">AGE index</a>. The Pixel Watch 3 added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-explained">Loss of Pulse Detection</a>, while most mainstream watches warn you if you've fallen or catch if your heart rate is higher or lower than normal. So, what's next?</p><p>Stop me if you've heard this before, but blood pressure might roll out more widely. Samsung has offered it for years but without FDA approval. Apple might add it to the Ultra 3 in 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/apple-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-2025/">MacRumors</a>), though leaks have suggested this for years now. Ubrani predicts that the feature will "come to more devices and more countries" in 2025.</p><p>Otherwise, he believes that we'll start to see a "more holistic approach to health tracking" in 2025, incorporating data from third-party devices into first-party health analysis. For example, we could see "glucose monitors working with smartwatches or in-home devices that track environmental impact on sleep and recovery."</p><p>I myself would love to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hydration-and-sweat-loss-arent-the-afterthought-fitness-watches-treat-them-as">better hydration and sweat tracking</a> on watches in 2025, so you know when you need to refuel — or if you're close to passing out — during tough activities.</p>
<h2 id="smart-rings-will-keep-growing-then-plateau-2">Smart rings will keep growing — then plateau</h2>
<p>Ubrani shared IDC's sales estimates and projections for watches and smart rings. Smart rings sold about 880,000 units in 2023 and doubled to 1.77 million in 2024. By 2025, they believe the number will climb to 2.54 million, a significant 43% boost.</p><p>No doubt, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> will keep getting better with new health insights. But IDC predicts that the subsequent jumps for 2026 (15%), 2027 (9%), and 2028 (5%) will decrease, with smart rings probably not growing much beyond 3–4 million anytime soon. That's a far cry from smartwatches (156.8 million in 2025) and fitness bands (35.3 million). Even smart glasses are expected to grow faster (more on that next).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-2.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I asked Ubrani why he thinks smart rings won't grow to supplant other wearables, he blamed "supply challenges inherent to the form factor," like the need for a sizing kit and the challenge of different inventory for every size and finish of a ring.</p><p>Also, "from a consumer perspective, pricing is a barrier," and "the market isn't huge because many would find a smartwatch to be good enough."</p><p>"I personally use [a smart ring] every day," Sag says, but "they are more of a niche product that's predominantly focused on health...rings simply don't replace smartwatches, they are mostly complementary."</p><p>He specifically praised the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> and how it can "enable better UX" but argued that "its limitation to Android only hampers its potential." I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-samsung-needs-to-release-galaxy-ring-on-iphone-challenge-apple-ring">argued that exact point last year</a> about Galaxy exclusivity, so it felt a bit vindicating.</p><p>As for what I <em>want</em> to see from more smart rings in 2025, I covered that in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-will-stay-niche-until-missing-features-added">previous column</a>: haptics for alarms and notifications, better "find my ring" tools, NFC support, more health vectors like passive AFib detection, and more unique styles than the typical thick-band look most of them share. And generally speaking, I just want <em>more</em> smart rings from mainstream brands; give me an Apple Ring, Pixel Ring, Garmin Ring, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="smart-glasses-break-out-into-the-mainstream-2">Smart glasses break out into the mainstream</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-blue-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Using the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses touch pad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart glasses might not fit your typical vision of "wearables," but they're actually quite similar to smart rings. Hear me out: They're something you typically buy based on your fashion sense and taste. They offer features already available in other popular smart tech like audio (earbuds), cameras (smartphones), and AI (phones again). And you have to design them for multiple styles and finishes, making them harder to sell and distribute.</p><p>Ubrani pointed out many of these concerns, saying that "most consumers don't need" AI, music, and photography in one $300 package on top of an expensive smartphone cost. People who already wear glasses "might be delighted to have additional features built-in," but these electronic tech companies "don't have the expertise to sell eyewear," especially through traditional channels. And those who <em>don't</em> wear glasses "might not want to wear glasses unless it's solving an unsolved issue."</p><p>Yet despite all these roadblocks to success, IDC projects that smart glasses' sales will jump from 2.5 to 3.5 million in 2025 and an additional 1 million each year through 2028, making them the fastest-growing wearable category.</p>

<p>"Smart glasses are not going to remain niche," Sag argued. "They will continue to grow because they are the most natural platform for AI and I believe that Meta's sales will continue to grow as it starts to co-market with EssilorLuxottica." Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-announces-long-term-essilorluxottica-eyewear-deal">won the bidding war for EssilorLuxottica</a>, allegedly beating out Google's bid, giving them the edge with their popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a>.</p><p>Beyond Meta, Google recently announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR platform</a> that'll power mixed-reality headsets, AR glasses, and smart glasses. Samsung also announced its "Project Moohan" XR headset, but we've also seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-xr-ar-devce-2025-launch-plans-rumor">leaked reports about Samsung AR glasses</a> arriving next year.</p><p>Unlike displayless smart glasses, it's hard to say whether AR glasses are ready for massive sales. We like brands like Xreal that use AR glasses as extended displays for gaming — and we're excited for the spatial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">Xreal One Pro</a> coming next year — but we're still years away from the wide-FOV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> meant to be worn outside or all day.</p><p>We'll see whether AR glasses prototypes like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Google's Project Astra</a> will make an appearance in 2025 and whether they will take the world by storm like Google Glass (temporarily) did. Sag was much more bullish about the prospects of AR glasses in the next few years, while Ubrani said an AR display would "change some of this conversation, but distribution will remain a challenge."</p>

<p>I wrote last week about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-2024-retrospective-theyre-getting-shockingly-good">how surprisingly <em>good</em> smartwatches have gotten in 2024</a> in terms of speedy app performance, reliable health & fitness data, and a wider range of designs and brand options. Whatever happens in 2025, we'll still have that baseline of quality to count upon.</p><p>My personal wishlist for new smartwatch features in 2025 is very niche: I'd love to see more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">rucking sports modes</a> that let you input your pack's weight and take it into account for training load, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-leaks-im-hoping-for-two-major-changes">leaked Garmin Instinct 3</a> might do just that.

<p>When it came time to reflect on my first full year as Wearables lead for Android Central, I thought about how I've been run ragged (literally) trying to test and review one smartwatch after another, but also how I didn't mind because, by and large, most of the watches I assessed were so darn good.</p><p>I reviewed (or will finish reviews for) watches from Apple, COROS, Garmin, Google, OnePlus, Polar, Samsung, Suunto, and Withings, plus my first-ever smart ring. And unlike my freelance days reviewing TVs, smart home tech, earbuds, and other hit-and-miss gadgets that I used and forgot about, there weren't any smartwatch "duds" where I had to find the silver lining amid the mediocrity.</p>
<p>None of my smartwatches were perfect, and several were good rather than great. Sometimes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">they underwhelmed me</a> despite <em>being</em> great. But all the brands I'd tested before improved in marked ways, and they all have a level of reliability that you can trust their sleep stats, heart rate zones during runs, GPS tracking, recovery time estimates, and other data that would've been erratic guesswork just a few years ago.</p><p>Basically, anyone short of a pro athlete can count on the health, fitness, and sleep data being <em>good enough</em> — and several options are trending toward true consistency. That's easy to take for granted! But for me to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">run a 20-miler wearing four watches</a> and have all four watches' results be so similar is pretty amazing, showing that the core data can be trusted if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">choose the right watch</a>.</p><p>And outside of fitness, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">Wear OS watches are better than ever</a>, while Apple continues to dominate the sales charts, keeping its fans happy by tweaking its familiar design to be thinner and improving its health analysis.</p>

<p>Of course, it's easy for <em>me</em> to feel happy about the state of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> in 2024; these smartwatch brands catered to my needs <em>and</em> made me look prescient with their newest features.</p><p>At the end of last year, I argued that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-and-fitness-watches-tried-stealing-each-others-tricks-in-2023">traditional smartwatches and fitness watches were trying to morph into each other</a>, with Apple and Samsung focusing more heavily on fitness and brands like Garmin trying to make their platform more accessible to mainstream people.</p><p>This year, you had the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> lean fully into running coaching, cardio load, and other running perks that sure made me happy, if not my gym-loving colleagues. The same goes for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>'s dual-band GPS and extra HR LEDs for better running data, or the Apple Watch Series and Ultra watches adding training load. They played right into my expectations and made fitness the centerpiece of their marketing.</p><p>I argued that most fitness watch brands would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">stop using MIP displays and transition to AMOLED</a> at lower price points. And just like that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> all used AMOLED, abandoning MIP tech that was great for outdoor use but annoyingly low-res and dim indoors. It's obvious that these brands see better visual accessibility as the future.</p><p>In January, I also argued that Garmin needed to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">indoor workout coaching</a> on par with its Garmin Coach for running and cycling. Wouldn't you know it, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> added a strength coach with auto-generated multi-month training plans, and the tool has since come to more affordable models like the Forerunners. Now, I have a useful way to get cross-training guidance using at-home weights.</p>

<p>Not every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-wearables-wishlist-2024">prediction and hope for wearables in 2024</a> came true; Google ignored my pleas for a "Fitbit renaissance" and effectively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">canceled Fitbit watches for good</a>. But it certainly was the "year of the smart ring," with total sales literally doubling from 880,000 to 1,769,000, according to numbers IDC shared with Android Central.</p><p>We've only just begun to see the uptick of "AI on your wrist," as analysts assured me would happen, but Samsung's Energy Score, Wellness Tips, and auto-suggested replies on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> certainly qualify! And I'm confident that 2025 will be the year Gemini and Apple Intelligence make it onto smartwatches in some form.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Garmin-Fenix-8-run-activities" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, both showing Run activity start screens." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2024, companies sold 154.1 million smartwatches and 36.6 million fitness bands, per data shared by IDC. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-wearable-band-market-q3-2024">Canalys</a> shows that fitness bands have bounced back slightly from 17 to 20% market share thanks to popularity in Latin America and EMEA. However, they've massively declined from their 50% share in 2020, falling short of smartwatches <em>and</em> basic watches.</p><p>Economically, companies like the bigger profit margins of smartwatches and have largely abandoned fitness trackers to Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei. Generally, people prefer the <em>look</em> of smartwatches more than cheap fitness bands, and the stats show they'll pay for style.</p><p>But beyond that, I think the growing smartwatch sales numbers — and higher sales of premium "Ultra" watches — is the result of smartwatches being marketed so effectively as being <em>life-saving</em>. They signal 911 if you fall, notice if your pulse is erratic, tell you how long you need to rest after a run to avoid serious injury, and catch if you have sleep apnea or (for some brands) a fever.</p><p>It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-challenge-of-using-smartwatches-and-smart-rings">not fun when your watch tells you something's wrong</a>. But even if ignorance is bliss, I'd rather know about a problem ahead of time than have it blindside me when the problem gets worse. And I think consumers would rather pay $300 for a watch that's 90% accurate than a $50 band with hit-or-miss stats.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm excited to see what new tricks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> pull off in 2025. Some of them will undoubtedly be gimmicky, and not everything will work well. But the core experience is better than ever, and I'm happy that I'm privileged enough to keep testing those features and sharing my thoughts, guesses, and rants about wearables with you.</p><p>It's easy for tech categories to fall into ruts, and just a few years back, it felt like most smartwatches were these squircle clones of one another with little innovation. But now, a bunch of different brands are playing to their strengths and giving consumers a wealth of options.</p><p>Since my job is often about nitpicking or complaining about smartwatch features, it's nice to reflect once in a while that things are, on the whole, good.</p>

With this new update, we're starting to get a better idea of what to expect from the next major update.</p><p>There are plenty of under-the-hood changes to help improve app startup, support for adaptive refresh rate, and haptics. There are also updates to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> with support for more data types and APIs for sharing health records. The cloud photo picker is getting a search function, and there are new APIs for predictive back animations and behaviors.</p><p>Of course, as is usual with developer previews, there are tons of features under the hood that Google is working on, but it's likely not all will make it to beta or stable. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get a good look at the user-facing features, as the Android 16 beta is expected to arrive in January.</p>

Those are the company's primary smartphone families, with the Moto G lineup performing strongly among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>, while the Edge and Razr lineups have been popular enough in the U.S. and globally that the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-stealing-away-iphone-users">set to double its business by 2026</a>. As such, the prospects of a ban in the U.S. would be pretty catastrophic for the company and the market, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-official-lg-exiting-smartphone-business">the loss of LG years ago</a>.</p><p>Ericsson has won preliminary rulings against Motorola before and is also involved in patent disputes in other regions, but Lenovo has so far managed to stave off a ban in South America. Hopefully, Lenovo can do the same for the U.S., and the two companies can come to some sort of agreement.</p>

It's mostly bug fixes aimed at addressing issues that cropped up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">first One UI 7 beta</a> released just a couple of weeks ago. This includes faster transitions, improved GPS, Quick Panel fixes, and much more. However, per the changelog, one known issue that's been pointed out is that the Tool panel sometimes does not appear in the Edge Panels.</p><p>If you're new to the One UI 7 beta, the update may come in at around 4GB, while those updating from the first beta may have only a 1GB download. For now, the beta remains exclusive to the Galaxy S24 series in select countries.</p><p>We recently published our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">first impressions of the One UI 7 beta</a>, highlighting the new UI elements (a vertical app drawer!), new features, and more. The stable update is expected to arrive with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series in early 2025.</p>

According to OnePlus, the 13R will feature a massive 6,000mAh battery, which is larger than the 5,500mAh battery on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. It will also apparently feature a new Gorilla Glass 7i, a thickness of 8mm, and a flat display.</p><p>There's still a lot we don't know about the 13R, such as the chipset, charging speed, and price. It will likely sport a lesser chip than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> that will be featured in the OnePlus 13 and likely less RAM than its flagship sibling's 24GB max.</p><p>Both phones will launch globally on January 7, 2025.</p>

They sport up to 50 hours of battery life and feature high-quality audio that isn't too bass-forward, offering crisp, clear listening.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for headphones that include Bluetooth, USB-C, and 3.5mm connectivity; you want high-quality audio that isn't overwhelmingly bass-heavy;</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need wireless headphones with active noise cancellation; you'd rather upgrade to the Beats Studio Pro headphones; you need wireless Hi-Res audio support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review" target="_blank">Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones</a> were released earlier this year, offering a very clean audio experience with mechanical buttons, up to 50 hours of battery life, and multiple audio connectivity options. Our review lays out how great they are as a pair of entry-level wireless headphones, offering audio quality that's more crisp and straightforward than past releases from Beats—which have naturally been louder in the low-end.</p><p>While the drivers aren't as inherently bassy as past headphone releases from Beats, the Solo 4s do still include the ability to EQ using the mobile app, so you can customize them to be this way if you want to.</p><p>Interestingly, these don't include active noise cancellation (ANC), so if that's a dealbreaker, you'll want to consider other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a>. Additionally, they don't support wireless Hi-Res formats like aptX Lossless or LDAC, which might be a need for some. Beyond that, however, it's hard to beat this level of audio quality from a name-brand for under $100, so it might be worth trying them out.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has introduced Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, an experimental AI model that lays out how it tackles tough problems in order to let you peek into its thought process and make it easier to see how it works.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a> Flash Thinking blends Flash tech’s speed with the reasoning chops of OpenAI’s o1 model. The difference is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> spells out its thought process, while o1 keeps things behind the curtain. That clear breakdown makes it a win for anyone needing to follow complex reasoning and dodge surprise AI slip-ups.</p><p>This unique approach helps it outshine the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> on tougher challenges.</p><p>Logan Kilpatrick, head of product for AI Studio, calls this model a big first step in Google’s push for smarter AI reasoning (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). Unlike most AI systems, these reasoning models can self-check their work, reducing common errors. The trade-off is that it takes a bit longer to get answers—sometimes seconds or even minutes.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just when you thought it was over... we’re introducing Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, a new experimental model that unlocks stronger reasoning capabilities and shows its thoughts.The model plans (with thoughts visible), can solve complex problems with Flash speeds, and more 🧵<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1869789820308074837">December 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google DeepMind’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, showed off on X some capabilities of Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Want to see Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking in action? Check out this demo where the model solves a physics problem and explains its reasoning. pic.twitter.com/Nl0hYj7ZFS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1869790032296579169">December 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The demo featured the AI solving tough physics problems by breaking them into smaller steps, showcasing its knack for methodical problem-solving and delivering solid, reliable results.</p><p>In another demo from Kilpatrick, the model shows off its impressive reasoning skills by combining visual and text data to solve a problem. It highlights how well the model can process and blend info from different sources.</p><p>While early demos have shown some missteps or missed details, it’s important to remember that this model is still in its early stages. Even so, these first impressions highlight the impressive potential of the DeepMind AI architecture.</p><p>The new model is free for everyone to try on Google’s AI Studio platform. That said, it has a 32,767-token limit, so it’s a bit capped compared to other versions. Still, it’s impressive how quickly it handles tricky problems that usually leave regular AI models scratching their heads.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there's such a thing as a tech hoarder, I'm sure I qualify. I have over 350 phones in the house, over a hundred earbuds, a ridiculous number of chargers, cables, power banks, and so on. I had a decent system to organize all the tech in the house, but the last two years have been particularly busy, and I let the clutter pile up to such an extent that I don't really know where things are any longer.</p><p>Recently, I embarked on a decluttering project to organize my tech better, and while it was labor-intensive, the upside is that I can now reliably locate products I need without wasting 30 minutes, and I consider that a win. So here's what worked for me and how you can get started.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-declutter-cables-and-accessories"><span>How to declutter cables and accessories</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JAdNqNg66s6C82tctk28Go" name="Decluttering tech" alt="Storage draw containing cables and chargers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JAdNqNg66s6C82tctk28Go.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cables contribute to clutter in a big way. I have hundreds of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> in the house, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/five-years-later-the-kindle-oasis-is-still-the-best-e-reader-ive-used-and-thats-a-problem">Kindle Oasis</a> is the only device that I regularly use that still needs Micro-USB, I somehow have a few dozen of those cables lying around that I didn't throw out.</p><p>I still need Lightning cables because of older iPhones and iPads, USB-A, Mini USB, and USB-B cables that I use with various synths and other music production gear, and USB Micro-B cables to use with old external hard drives. Similarly, I have over a hundred wired earbuds, and while they don't take up much room, there's no good way to organize them, particularly with IEMs.</p><p>That's just the start of the cable clutter; I have dozens of Ethernet cables of varying lengths, HDMI and DisplayPort cables, and a boggling number of RCA audio cables. While I had a good system to categorize cables in the past, things have gotten out of hand in the last two years, and nowadays, it's a bigger chore to dig through the cables than just buying new ones.</p>
<p>My solution? I use cable ties, and I started getting storage boxes where I can easily categorize cables based on need or utility. I bought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ZHSMYUP-Management-Compartments-Electronic-Accessories/dp/B0CGPJ75YB">these storage boxes</a> to store USB cables, and there are larger variants if you need to house Ethernet or HDMI cables. These storage boxes are just as great with earbuds and chargers as well.</p><p>You can also get retractable cables; I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0C858GPF9">this Baseus cable</a> over the last 12 months, and it's just so much more convenient. I just got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rollingsquare.com/products/incharge%C2%AE-xs-240w-4in1-keyring-cable">inCharge XS</a>, and this tiny cable has USB-C, USB-A, and Lightning connectors, and it is able to charge devices up to 240W. With these multi-connector cables and retractable options, you don't have to deal with as much clutter, and they're just easier to manage.</p><p>The best thing you can do is give away cables you don't need. This is what I did recently; I put a few dozen old chargers and cables in a bag and handed it away, and it felt great. I'd recommend holding on to three of each cable variety with older cables because you don't ultimately need to have a lot of those lying around.</p><p>Another thing that made a big difference is labeling things. The only reason I'm able to find anything at all is because I finally started labeling all accessories and cables, and I use this 10-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/LABELWORKS-LW-PX300-Industrial-Label-Maker/dp/B08JQMFZ6F">Epson label maker</a> that's still going strong — the same cannot be said of my Epson printer.</p>

<p>I've been testing phones for over a decade now, and I amassed quite a collection of phones, including the latest flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a>, and everything in between. I have a charging routine at the start of every quarter where I make sure all of these devices are charged to 50% (what do you do on a Sunday?), and once that's done, they go back into their boxes.</p><p>I tried several techniques for storing phones, and nowadays, I just have a dozen of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/sockerbit-box-with-lid-white-80316067/" target="_blank">these IKEA storage boxes</a>, with phones arranged by manufacturer (Xiaomi alone takes up four boxes). I store chargers in individual boxes, and charging cables are now sorted into four categories: USB-C PD cables that deliver at least 100W, USB-C to USB-A cables, manufacturer-bundled cables, and regular USB-C cables to transfer data.</p><p>I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Antistatic-Shielding-Anti-Static-Motherboard-Electronic/dp/B0B6G3H6DK">anti-static bags</a> with hard drives, DRAM modules, and motherboards, but the rest of the general tech products — routers, NAS servers, tablets, keyboards, mice, headsets, and docking stations — go into individual shelves. The biggest issue in this area is finding the cable associated with the product, so these days, I just put power cables in sealable bags and label them accordingly.</p>
<p>If you have old phones sitting in a drawer, I'd suggest charging the devices at least every six months to ensure the battery doesn't balloon or degrade. You can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-how-i-reuse-old-phones">reuse older phones</a>, and they hold up pretty well for a lot of tasks. For example, you obviously can't use something like the LG G4 as a daily driver; the phone doubles up as a media player, and the built-in DAC is brilliant in its own right. One of my best use cases for old phones is as a security camera — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://alfred.camera/">Alfred</a> is a great utility.</p><p>Another solution is to just sell, give away, or donate older tech. I'm particularly bad at this, and while I don't like giving away phones, I do a good job handing out devices to family members and friends. Selling older tech is another option, but you don't get much — a better choice is to see if your carrier has a trade-in offer toward a newer device. Barring that, my recommendation is to use a service like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://swappa.com/">Swappa</a> to sell old phones, notebooks, and any unwanted tech that's just sitting around. Regardless of how you give away old phones or notebooks, you will need to make sure you securely erase your data. <br><br>If you've got decades-old products that don't have any material value, you should consider recycling them. Best Buy has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/recycling/pcmcat149900050025.c?id=pcmcat149900050025">good recycling program</a>, and most counties offer a recycling service in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CwTWhizVW7LyeyQY2yzx24" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-15.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CwTWhizVW7LyeyQY2yzx24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Organizing digital media can be a daunting task. I did this exercise at the start of 2024 when I was setting up a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">100TB home server</a>, and I realized I have the same data in at least three different locations. If you have a local media collection, I'd recommend going through the data and using a tool like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a> to better organize your content. With music in particular, I suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a>; I used it quite a bit in the past.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> is a terrific utility in this regard, and it takes care of all the organization and metadata. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://roon.app/en/">Roon</a> is similarly great for organizing your music library, and while it has unique features, it is quite costly at $15 a month. When it comes to photos, a utility like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digikam.org/about/" target="_blank">digiKam</a> is handy for organizing and adding tags, and if you need a self-hosted solution, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://immich.app/" target="_blank">Immich</a> is the best around.</p>
<p>As for storing photos, I use a NAS to store all photos and videos going back a decade, and it automatically backs up any new photos taken from my phone. I then back up this data to another NAS and use an external SSD as a third storage medium. Photo organization is handled by the NAS, and it sorts photos into custom folders categorized by year. If you're looking to get started, I'd suggest getting something like the DiskStation DS224 Plus — it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-2-Bay-DiskStation-DS224-Diskless/dp/B0C6927XPX">costs $297</a> and is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QyLFGuapk3FsVNj94smSta" name="plex-media-server.jpg" alt="Plex Media Server logo against RGB lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QyLFGuapk3FsVNj94smSta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it doesn't have to do with digital media, I'd recommend backing up all Google data every two years; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout</a> is a great utility as it bundles all Gmail emails, Drive data, and photos and videos stored in Google Photos in one go. You get to choose which service's data you want to download; I just selected everything, and the size of the download came out to 828GB this year.</p><p>If you're running out of storage in Google Drive and iCloud, both services offer tools to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/quota">see what data is using up storage</a>, and you can delete data accordingly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ultimately, the biggest issue with decluttering is getting started. I had a good handle on my digital media and online activity, but I realized I let physical products pile up, and it was a sizeable undertaking to get them organized and accessible. The best recommendation I can give is to start slow; if you've got a massive photo library or mailbox that needs sorting out, start by doing 20 to 30 photos at a time, and that will allow you to build momentum.</p><p>The same goes for organizing your folders, online accounts, and any digital media. The key is to be consistent, and while I know that may sound hard to do now, it becomes routine — if not enjoyable — once you get a handle on things.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:430px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.88%;"><img id="LndZSz9X8VTNPbXaunGHdP" name="followers.jpg" alt="Follow the leaders" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LndZSz9X8VTNPbXaunGHdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="430" height="279" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Auditing the way you use the internet is a pain in the butt. But it's worth it for a lot of people; you might be surprised to see all the things you've forgotten about.</p><p>Some important reasons are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/your-online-security-and-privacy-depend-on-more-than-just-googles-work">better privacy and online security</a>, less stress, and maybe even becoming more productive. Less online presence means fewer potential targets for people trying to hijack your identity or get your money, and it reduces the amount of information about you that's online for anyone to see.</p><p>A clutter-free digital life will probably be less stressful and provide fewer distractions, making you a bit more productive overall. You can still have fun, but all the digital trash is gone — it's just like hauling the junk you don't need anymore to the dumpster or recycle bin.</p>
<p>This is something I do every year. I can't say how effective it is at making my life better, but it certainly hasn't caused any issues for me. Here's how I do it.</p><p><strong>Audit your social media. </strong>Have any inactive accounts at places you no longer visit? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-delete-your-twitter-account">Delete them</a>; there's a reason you don't use them, and you aren't going to miss out on anything. For the accounts you use, review your privacy settings, delete any postings you think should be deleted, and purge your friends/following list of anyone who isn't adding value to your life. You aren't going to miss seeing what they have to say.</p><p><strong>Review your subscriptions.</strong> You might be surprised at what companies you're paying every month and how much it all adds up to. This is easy to do: take a look at your bank and credit card statements for the past six months and see where the money is going. If you aren't going to use a service, unsubscribe from it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="XRSDcCBmjPYZU23zJH2oqP" name="Disney-Plus-Hulu-hero.jpg" alt="Disney Plus and Hulu icons side by side on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRSDcCBmjPYZU23zJH2oqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Organize your inbox.</strong> Unsubscribe from all the junk mailing lists you've ended up being on, and add a label for the ones you want to keep. Create folders for all the things that are worth reading and read them; never let them sit unread forever. Delete old emails that you'll never need to free up space, and take the time to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-forward-email-your-main-gmail-account-so-google-now-sees-it">create filters</a> to sort out everything as it arrives so you don't have to do it manually every 5,000 messages.</p><p><strong>Secure your accounts.</strong> Go through and change all your passwords and use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">password manager</a> because you're never going to remember them all. Enable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication</a> for everything that will let you use it — this is the single best thing you can do to keep people out of your digital stuff. While you're at it, try to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gmail-spammers-are-winning-the-war-on-your-inbox">learn to be suspicious</a> of any message that asks for any of these passwords or logins. Bank of America isn't going to text you and ask you to fill out a Google form with your account details, but someone who wants to see what's in your bank account might.</p>
<p><strong>Review your privacy settings.</strong> If an app or service has settings under the Privacy or Security label, go through them all and make sure they are set to your liking. This goes for companies like Apple and Google, as well as the company that made your phone or computer. They want to know everything they can about you, so make sure you're only sharing what you <em>want</em> to be sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to limit your digital footprint.</strong> Be cautious about sharing your information, making sure it's worth it for you. You can Google yourself to see what's out there and find examples of why this can matter, and you can always request to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-to-remove-your-personal-information-from-results-on-google">have your personal information removed from search results</a>. Something nobody thinks about is product reviews, but they should. Nobody needs to know what brand of underwear you bought from Walmart.com, and you're not getting anything in return for writing a review. Feel free to ignore the emails that beg you to do it.</p>

<p>You're probably always going to use the internet in some fashion — it's here to stay. What's important is that you use it on your terms in ways that you benefit from.</p><p>Taking the time to sort out all your old digital junk is a great way to get started.</p>

It plans to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> several months in advance — the current timeline suggests a stable build sometime in Q2 2025, and there will be a second Android release, albeit a minor one. <br><br>The move is in line with Google's efforts to deliver timely features faster, and it is a positive change. Of course, it remains to be seen how other manufacturers adapt; most companies struggle to roll out one update on time (looking at you, Xiaomi and Motorola), so with an accelerated timeline and two releases in 2025, there's no shortage of things to talk about. With Android 16 taking center stage, here's what I want to see in the next version of the OS and predictions for the broader Android ecosystem in 2025.</p>

<h2 id="updates-all-the-time-2">Updates all the time</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C7zTvtoXoCMSCMi5d4u3n3" name="android-15-22.jpg" alt="Android 15 Easter egg on Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7zTvtoXoCMSCMi5d4u3n3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-2-released">developer preview of Android 16</a> is already available, but it doesn't have any notable new additions yet — that will come with the public betas, which are slated to hit in Q1 2025. Google is moving up the Android release timeline to give other brands the ability to deliver the update to a wider range of devices. With the Pixel launch now pushed to August, it's likely Google wanted the stable build to be available well before that so that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> can have it pre-installed. <br><br>Google says the Android 16 release will have all the major features, and the second release scheduled to be available in Q4 will include stability tweaks and optimizations. Given the wording, I think it's entirely likely we'll go back to point releases, and the second build could be dubbed Android 16.1. <br><br>Now, the big question around the new update timeline is when you'll see it on other devices. Xiaomi doesn't even have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> schedule ready, and while other manufacturers are thankfully doing a better job, it will be until Q1 2025 when most phones released in 2024 switch over to Android 15, including those from Samsung.<br><br>There's no telling when Android 16 will go out to devices other than Pixels, but the manufacturers I talked to said they're setting up the groundwork to have the build rolled out relatively soon after release.</p>
<h2 id="key-interface-changes-again-2">Key interface changes (again)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2aaWbVWSSAFVAmLknuX2y8" name="android-15-volume-panel.jpg" alt="Android 15 volume panel on Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2aaWbVWSSAFVAmLknuX2y8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I like the oversized tiles that Google introduced with its Material You overhaul in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>, not everyone is a fan of the design. In fact, most brands eschewed this design and continued offering regular-sized tiles, with ColorOS meeting Google halfway by using a split scheme that works rather well. With Android 16, Google is once again going back to smaller-sized tiles, and that should be welcome news if you're using a Pixel. <br><br>Foldables are no longer a niche, and Google rolled out meaningful changes in Android 15 aimed at these devices. That said, I want Google to offer better multitasking in Android 16. OnePlus is the best at this, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-z-fold-6-and-oneplus-open-camera-against-mother-nature-the-results-were-unexpected">Open foldable</a> has a freeform multitasking mode that's a delight to use. Google needs to roll out something similar in Android 16.</p>
<h2 id="ai-everywhere-2">AI everywhere</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dspAcxjMLyPU3aUAne7MWW" name="google-pixel-9-pixel-weather-app-03.jpg" alt="Exploring the new Pixel Weather app on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL including AI summary and the new widget view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dspAcxjMLyPU3aUAne7MWW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't really see the point of AI, but I will admit that Google does a great job rolling out AI features that are actually useful. The best part is that the brand is collaborating with other manufacturers to make these features accessible on a wider range of phones, and that's a good thing. <br><br>As such, it will be interesting to see how Honor and Samsung integrate Google's suite of AI tools into their devices in 2025. Both brands are leaning heavily into AI to differentiate their software, and with the Magic 7 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> slated to launch soon, we don't need to wait long to see what new AI features are onboard.</p>
<h2 id="android-and-chromeos-together-2">Android and ChromeOS together</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-26.jpg" alt="Black Myth Wukong via NVIDIA GeForce Now on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm yet to use a Chromebook, and while I'm not the target audience for these devices — I use a custom Windows machine with an RTX 4090 — there's clearly a sizeable demand, and it is interesting to see Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/alleged-google-pixel-laptop-early-report">slowly merging ChromeOS into Android</a>. I think this is a positive move as it allows for tighter integration between the two platforms.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-2">Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hhYsUHQUEi6pmBmLM9hunL" name="Android-XR-Graphic" alt="An Android XR graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhYsUHQUEi6pmBmLM9hunL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is teaming up with Samsung and Qualcomm to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a>, a new OS built for extended reality headsets and glasses. We'll get an initial taste of the hardware in 2025 by way of Samsung's Project Moohan, but other brands should start rolling out their own products later in the year. <br><br>Android XR brings YouTube, Google TV, Google Maps, Google Photos, Gemini, and Chrome to XR devices, and a consistent interface is the inflection point needed to take these devices mainstream. Having used a few headsets in the past, the limiting factor continues to be the software, and if Google is able to deliver a fluid interface with access to its best utilities, we could see this category flourishing in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-62">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A jury sided with Qualcomm in a key legal battle over the company's custom Oryon CPU cores, which power Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>Arm said in a statement that it plans to seek a retrial following the jury's deadlocked verdict.</li><li>The decision means that Qualcomm can continue to sell products with processors designed using Nuvia tech.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Arm's lawsuit against Qualcomm over the chipmaker's custom CPU cores ended in a mistrial Friday, Dec. 20, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-jury-deadlocked-arm-trial-193123626.html" target="_blank">Reuters</a> first reported. The mistrial verdict leaves some uncertainty around Arm's grievances with Qualcomm, and Arm said in a statement it planned to seek a retrial. However, a jury decided that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> had a valid license for its Nuvia cores — a central issue of the dispute between the two companies.</p><p>The trial ended in a mistrial because the jury couldn't unanimously agree on whether or not Nuvia breached its agreement with Arm. However, the judge presiding over the case cautioned the two companies about seeking a retrial.</p><p>"I don't think either side had a clear victory or would have had a clear victory if this case is tried again," said U.S. Judge Maryellen Noreika in the courtroom, as reported by Reuters.</p><p>The judge encouraged the two companies to resolve their dispute privately rather than seek another lawsuit, as Judge Noreika seemed convinced that a new trial would lead to the same uncertain result. However, in a statement to Android Central, Arm said it plans to seek a retrial.</p><p>“We are disappointed that the jury was unable to reach consensus across the claims. We intend to seek a retrial due to the jury’s deadlock," an Arm spokesperson told Android Central in an email. "From the outset, our top priority has been to protect Arm’s IP and the unparalleled ecosystem we have built with our valued partners over more than 30 years. As always, we are committed to fostering innovation in our rapidly evolving market and serving our partners while advancing the future of computing.”</p><p>Qualcomm, for one, is satisfied by the jury's decision and the trial's conclusion.</p><p>“We are pleased with today’s decision. The jury has vindicated Qualcomm’s right to innovate and affirmed that all the Qualcomm products at issue in the case are protected by Qualcomm’s contract with Arm," said Ann Chaplin, Qualcomm's general counsel, in a statement emailed to Android Central. "We will continue to develop performance-leading, world class products that benefit consumers worldwide, with our incredible Oryon ARM-compliant custom CPUs.”</p><p>Arm sued Qualcomm two years ago when the two companies disagreed about what royalties were owed to Arm for Qualcomm's use of custom CPU designs. Things were complicated by Qualcomm's purchase of startup chip designer Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021. The issue concerned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/arm-is-pulling-the-plug-on-qualcomms-chip-design-license">whether Qualcomm had valid licenses to the Arm designs originally licensed to Nuvia</a> before the acquisition. These designs led to the creation of Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, which powered Snapdragon X Elite, and later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p><p>Matters became more serious over the summer, when Arm said it wanted all Snapdragon X laptops "destroyed." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/arm-is-giving-qualcomm-the-wake-up-call-it-needs">Money and royalties were at the heart of the disagreement</a>, since court documents viewed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/arm-qualcomm-trial-set-begin-over-chip-contract-dispute-2024-12-16/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> revealed that Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia could've cost Arm $50 million in lost revenue.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung kicked off a test today (Dec 20) via the "Display Assistant beta" app through its Galaxy Lab test environment.</li><li>The app delivers several display options that let users take complete control of its adaptive brightness, refresh rate, and more.</li><li>Samsung gave its testers a jolly second One UI 7 beta, which delivered a host of fixes for errors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As Samsung works on its next major OS, a new app test grants users more control of their Galaxy phone's display.</p><p>Known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1869983923079655911?s=31">Ice Universe</a> noticed a new app wrapped in Samsung's Galaxy Labs test environment called "Display Assistant beta" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-display-assistant-app-control-display-settings-per-app/">SamMobile</a>). At first glance, it seems the app will give users total control of their device's display to dictate its behavior for every app. The test brings several features users can experiment with, like "brightness limit profile."</p><p>This gives users two choices: standard and light. When selected, the former will cut down your brightness when your device reaches higher temperatures. The latter will keep your brightness as is; however, your Galaxy device will cool down slower.</p><p>There's also a "standard refresh rate" option. According to the publication, any apps placed in there will be restricted to "60Hz per second to save power."</p><p>The tipster on X highlighted several more key features of the Display Assistant beta, such as "Curtain mode," "One click screen on for 30 minutes," and the ability to control the adaptive brightness of your Galaxy device. The in-app description states adaptive brightness will alter the display based on the user's surroundings.</p><p>However, with it set at 2x speed, users can slide the bubble along the slider down to 1x or double it to 4x.</p>

<p>In short, several of these features can affect your Galaxy phone's power as altering its brightness or limiting the refresh rate can take the stress off its battery. Samsung just launched this Display Assistant beta via Galaxy Labs; however, it is limited to One UI 7 (specifically v7.0.12). Those in the OS beta can likely grab this and start experimenting.</p><p>Speaking of One UI 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">the second beta</a> just kicked off for enrolled testers in the program. We spotted the beta rolling onto the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which involves the other S24 devices in the series. Enrolled testers will find a 1GB download packed with bug fixes for several One UI errors and malfunctions. The Now Bar was among the areas of One UI getting fixed as users reported a "continuous" display error.</p><p>Additionally, the Korean OEM detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">what to expect</a> with One UI 7 once it launches. Samsung intends for its Now Bar to be a useful, curated app assistant right on your lock screen. The upcoming software is also working on a "Personal Data Engine," which should help users utilize its on-device AI with better privacy and security.</p>

<hr>
<p>We're expecting OnePlus to launch a new watch next year; however, the latest leak highlights a major addition.</p><p>Recent rumors stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oneplus-watch-3-to-feature-major-upgrades-including-a-rotating-crown/">SmartPrix</a>, which cites X tipsters Chuvun and Yogesh Brar in saying the OnePlus Watch 3 may feature a "rotating crown." The tipster delivered an alleged rendering of the device based on a prototype. The photo displays the new rotating crown where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2's</a> home button would be.</p><p>It's (incredibly) likely that should this rumor prove true, this rotating crown would aid in the watch's navigation. If you think of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch</a> lineup, users can twist the crown to scroll through their available apps instead of constantly swiping a finger. Regardless, this is something we've had on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-wishlist">Watch 3 wishlist</a> — hopefully, it happens.</p><p>Looking closely, it also appears that the OnePlus Watch 3 may retain its other physical option: the multifunction button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:596px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.67%;"><img id="iNwSgt8dWWAN2H4XwfJhDM" name="oneplus-watch-3-rotating-crown-render-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the OnePlus Watch 3 suggests a rotating crown could greet users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iNwSgt8dWWAN2H4XwfJhDM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="596" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tipsters reportedly glimpsed the watch's internals, such as the company's "exploration" of LTE support. Rumors add that the Watch 3 could sport 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a battery capacity that's ~500mAh or higher. Additionally, the Chinese OEM could veer toward the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> from Qualcomm.</p><p>Furthermore, the Watch 3 could step up its heart rate sensors by providing an ECG feature. This particular function comes with a warning as the publication states it could be restricted "to select markets." These types of things require government clearance to provide ECG on a smartwatch.</p><p>OnePlus Watch 3 rumors have been relatively light, but we've heard it could feature a 631mAh battery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-fcc-listing-teaser-spotted">following FCC certification</a>. The listing stated the battery would be paired with a 10W charger. Moreover, that U.S. document adds the device the information was based on came from a "production unit," pointing toward its impending launch.</p><p>Once again, we're hearing similar rumors like LTE support alongside eSIM. Speculation says consumers may see the Watch 3 include GNSS and NFC support alongside your expected Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.</p><p>Another rumor claims that OnePlus could l<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-upcoming-global-launch-rumors">aunch a few devices globally</a> in closing timing. The publication's report doubles down on this, saying the Watch 3 could debut in Q1 2025. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-the-oneplus-13-global-launch-date">already confirmed</a> a January 7, 2025 launch for the OnePlus 13 globally. So, perhaps, the Watch 3 won't take too long to arrive.</p>

<hr>
<p>Additional aid to ward off online threats is reportedly coming for Google Chrome.</p><p>In a thread on X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1869583728370151456">Leopeva64</a> highlighted their discovery of a new Canary flag, which mentions improved scam detection in Chrome (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-3510543/">Android Authority</a>). Per the tipster, several commits in the Chromium Gerrit state Google's AI is the main catalyst. Moreover, the flag states the feature is known as "client side detection brand and intent for scam detection."</p><p>The company's description says that the feature will leverage its LLM (large language model) to "inquire" about the brand and the page's true intentions.</p><p>Other information shows that the LLM will scan a website for potential scams. In using Gemini, the recent Chrome Canary flag will use its AI software to find any <br>"discrepancies" on a website. Apparently, the AI will try to tie things back to the real brand (if a scam is evident) so users know what's real and fake.</p><p>What's more, the discovery of "suspicious intent" is the other side of this feature's functions. When enabled, the AI will identify chances of phishing, counterfeit goods, and other "fraudulent activities."</p><p>This feature is still experimental within Google for Chrome. However, once it arrives, it'll (hopefully) add to the company's efforts in combating dangerous threads to users and their credentials. The tipster adds that these scamming/suspicious intent detection methods might only work if users have "Enhanced Protection" on in Chrome's settings. There's also a chance that mobile users could see this feature, too, but it's unclear if it'll be a simultaneous release.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like Chrome will also use AI to detect scams, there's a new flag in Canary that suggests this:https://t.co/uQb84zbqeW pic.twitter.com/7CyK5y4gtO<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1869583728370151456">December 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google was spotted working on another feature for Chrome to help users online called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-store-reviews-blurb-spotted">Store Reviews</a>." Also backed by AI, the browser's generative AI would compile a quick summary of a website sourced from websites like Trust Pilot and ScamAdvisor. While the initial discovery couldn't get the feature working properly, it's assumed that these Store Reviews will give folks a decent understanding of a website before interacting.</p><p>With this new scam detection feature seemingly in the works, it seems both could go hand in hand to bolster a user's online defenses.</p><p>Recently, Google detailed its new AI model in Gmail, which helps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">fend off scam attempts</a>. The company reported that Gmail has successfully defended users against 20% more scam attempts than before. Google is also encouraging users to report any emails they feel could be a scam so that it can help everyone else in the future.</p><p>Similarly, the Google Phone app beta on Android picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">real-time scam detection</a>.

<p>Ever since the rumors began swirling about Google potentially releasing a "Pixel Laptop," I've been skeptical, to say the least. The initial reports came just before other rumors suggested Google decided to cancel its future plans for a Pixel Tablet 2. So, while it might seem as though Google is lining things up to replace the Tablet with an Android-powered laptop, something just didn't sit right.</p><p>My skepticism marched into overdrive after some posited that this could be the beginning of Google replacing ChromeOS with Android. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/dropping-chromeos-for-android-on-pixel-laptop-doesnt-make-sense">I've already explained</a> why I think that would be a bad idea and why Chromebooks are likely here to stay.</p><p>However, I recently had a "lightbulb moment" about what I think a Pixel Laptop would look like. Provided that it ever sees the light of day and isn't just a project that will end up going the way of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Pixelbook 2</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.96%;"><img id="9ZYuBzpGsGjcUvmtyj7hLa" name="microsoft-surface-pro-11-windows-central.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 11 on desk with keyboard folio and Surface Pen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYuBzpGsGjcUvmtyj7hLa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1179" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, it's entirely possible that we see something akin to the Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Surface Pro 11</a>. In this imaginary scenario, the Pixel Laptop would be powered by one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite</a> chips and feature a detachable keyboard.</p><p>It might seem odd that I'm suggesting that Google opts for the Snapdragon X Elite as opposed to something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> successor. But it would honestly make sense, provided that this is a product that Google plans to release future iterations of.</p><p>Part of the issues with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> stems from the awkward release cycle that it was given. First, it was announced in October 2022 before being released in June 2023, and even then, you couldn't just get the Tablet without also getting the Charging Speaker Dock. It wasn't until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">May 2024</a> that Google let you ditch the dock, which was great but wasn't the Pixel Tablet announcement we were hoping for.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not to mention that we're now heading into 2025, and no successor has been announced, so we're "stuck" with Google's Tensor G2. For what it is and what it does, the G2 and Pixel Tablet still perform well. However, with the constant push to get Gemini into the hands of as many people as possible, the Pixel Tablet is an obvious Achilles heel.</p><p>Logically, it would make sense for Google to release an Android-powered Pixel Laptop with the next Tensor SoC. But, I think the Snapdragon X Elite would be better positioned for longevity as it seems to be just what the doctor ordered for Windows on Arm devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UEghSkLSKd6P4aG2xfkUpA" name="terminal-app-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Terminal app on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UEghSkLSKd6P4aG2xfkUpA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of the building blocks for Google to make such a move are already there, and various improvements are continuing to be made to Android. Just recently, a dedicated Linux Terminal app was added with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-2-is-here-with-our-first-look-at-the-working-linux-terminal-app">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2</a>, which is also available in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview</a>.</p><p>This is a rather important piece of the puzzle, as I believe Google will eventually make it operate similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">Linux on a Chromebook</a>. With the Terminal app, you would be able to download and install compatible Linux apps, just like you can with ChromeOS.</p><p>And while the Terminal app is enabled out of the box with the aforementioned beta software, I highly doubt this would be the case with the final release. It's more likely to be hidden behind Developer Options, similar to how it's kind of buried in the Settings app for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP" name="google-pixel-tablet-freeform-windows.jpg" alt="Freeform windows on the Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to how we would interact with the Pixel Laptop, I think we see a different, yet familiar approach. Instead of relying on the Android interface that we have now, it would ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-15-desktop-mode-revamp-spotted">Google's Desktop Mode</a> as the default "launcher." When detached, it would revert back to the traditional Pixel Launcher, and would hopefully offer a way to switch back and forth. It's not like this is anything new, even from Google.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> presents the same kind of approach, but in reverse. Meaning that you start out with Android and then can switch to the desktop-like experience either when attaching a keyboard or tapping a Quick Settings toggle.</p><p>ChromeOS tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11</a> operate in a similar fashion. When the keyboard is connected, you have the same interface found on any other Chromebook that you pick up. Remove the keyboard, and you're relegated to the App Launcher, with no proper "desktop" to speak of.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kjPbR7AB56WRwLg8oVP3nC" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-hands-on-11.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 tablet separated from Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kjPbR7AB56WRwLg8oVP3nC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With ChromeOS, it's not the most ideal or enjoyable situation, but with Android at the helm, it's no different than what we already have. There would be the question of whether we would be able to still use Desktop Mode or floating app windows when detached, or if Google would try to keep the different UI experiences separate.</p><p>Part of the reason why I think that this Pixel Laptop might be real is, again, thanks to leaks and rumors. Google has been reportedly working on a first-party keyboard and stylus since the original Pixel Tablet was released.</p><p>Here we are more than two years later, and nothing of the sort has been announced. At the same time, we continue to see rumors and leaks suggesting that Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2-accessory-prototype-rumors">working on those accessories</a>, and that's even after the Pixel Tablet 2 cancellation rumors surfaced.</p><p>So why would Google cancel the Pixel Tablet 2 just to continue investing time and money into the development of accessories? Who knows? I guess there's at least a little bit of fire where the smoke is, but still not enough for me to be fully convinced.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has been spotted working on a way for users to quickly edit pictures in the Photos app before sharing.</p><p>The feature, dubbed "Quick Edits," was allegedly spotted by a tipster who reported its existence to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-quick-edit-3510629/">Android Authority</a>. According to its source, the option appeared on their Pixel 6 Pro in v7.10.0 of the app. The user states that the new menu, which surfaced when hitting the "Share" button in Photos, lets you quickly edit a singular photo before sending it.</p><p>The assortment of editing tools is much more limited in Quick Edits as the user only noticed a way to keep it "Original" alongside options to "Enhance" or crop it.</p><p>The "Original" option is straightforward as your photo will remain unaltered before sending. However, the "Enhanced" option seems to reconfigure the photo's colors.  The example shows that the colors are much richer and defined with much deeper shadows in the areas void of light. Overall, "enhanced" pictures appear brighter and a little clearer. This also seems very reminiscent of the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-enhance-before-sharing-new-ui-3493044/">auto-enhance</a>" AI-backed feature the publication picked up on in October.</p><p>Of course, this is a quicker alternative to what users would find in the app's proper editing tools.</p><p>Quick Edits in Photos lets users see the difference by long-pressing the picture "to see original."</p><p>The post states that the cropping feature is the same as found in the main editing tab, so users will see similar tools there. The user informed the publication that this feature appears when selecting multiple photos, as well, meaning users can likely edit a batch of pictures (if they desire) before sending them off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:978px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.45%;"><img id="QwaBbg2kCNFg3Rw9qSTkdQ" name="google-photos-quick-edit-share-menu-discovery" alt="Google Photos is reportedly creating a "Quick Edits" option for users who share pictures." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QwaBbg2kCNFg3Rw9qSTkdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="978" height="513" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mishaal Rahman writing for the publication states that, aside from this informant, there haven't been any other reports of "Quick Edits." There are no clear signs about when it could hit more Pixel devices, but you should stay alert for it.</p><p>Curiously, Google reworked its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-photos-android-14-share-sheet-hitting-more-pixels">Android 14 sharing screen</a> earlier this year on several Pixel phones. When sharing, users were given a quick preview of the image in question with two initial rows of places to send the picture, which involved contacts and apps. However, this revamped menu gave users a "Modify" button to add more pictures to the message.

<ul><li>The OnePlus 13R will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, according to an early Amazon India listing.</li><li>While not Qualcomm's newest processor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is fast and was a flagship chip just a year ago.</li><li>The listing also confirms the OnePlus 13R will get key OxygenOS 15 AI features, like AI Notes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus just confirmed Wednesday, Dec. 18, that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13r-is-a-thin-midranger-with-a-6-000mah-battery-arriving-january-7">the OnePlus 13R will debut alongside the standard OnePlus 13</a> on Jan. 7, 2025, and an early Amazon listing now confirms a few more key details about the upcoming midranger. A page on Amazon India that has since been pulled revealed the OnePlus 13R's processor and one of its upcoming AI features (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_13r_processor_revealed-news-65813.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>As expected, it seems the OnePlus 13R will be powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor. While a last-generation chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 powers current flagship smartphones — such as the OnePlus 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. It's no slouch, and it should help the OnePlus 13R keep its title as one of the best-performing Android midrangers you can buy.</p><p>The regular OnePlus 13 will be powered by the newer and more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>. However, it'll certainly be more expensive as a result.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cP46gaP9J3hA4kkf5VSHBo" name="OnePlus-13-Launch-Event" alt="The OnePlus 13 launch event invitation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cP46gaP9J3hA4kkf5VSHBo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the listing confirms that the OnePlus 13R will support the brand's AI Notes feature. This isn't particularly surprising either since this feature was included in the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> update. It's good news that OnePlus plans to bring its best features to the cheaper OnePlus 13R, though. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 system-on-a-chip is very capable of performing AI tasks, so it looks like OnePlus will make the most of it.</p><p>A few other details, like the OnePlus 13R's full spec sheet and pricing, are not available yet. OnePlus confirmed that it would be a thin phone with a 6,000mAh battery, and it will launch in two colorways: Nebula Noir and Astral Trail. For more information, you'll have to tune in to the official launch event on Jan. 7. There, the OnePlus 13R will debut along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and a new colorway for the OnePlus Buds Pro 3.</p>

Amazon has launched a limited-time sale on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYFCZZ9F" target="_blank"><strong>Garmin Epix Pro Gen 2, offering 32% off</strong></a> and bringing the price down to its lowest point ever. To be sure, this deal was expected with the arrival of the newly launched Garmin Fenix, but you can't beat getting a premium last-gen smartwatch for a $350 discount.</p><p>As far as smartwatches go, the second-generation Garmin Epix Pro includes a super high-quality AMOLED screen, 16-day battery life, multi-band GPS for outdoorsy folks, and a broad range of health tracking, fitness, and map features. Originally launched in 2022, this configuration of the watch typically goes for $1,100, so getting it at such a steep discount might be a good option for those who don't mind a last-gen watch.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a premium smartwatch for under $1,000; long battery life is a major priority for you; you need a smartwatch with multi-band GPS.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you'd rather just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-dilemma-buy-the-epix-gen-2-for-an-all-time-low-usd500-off-or-shell-out-for-the-fenix-8">upgrade to the Garmin Fenix 8 </a>for even longer battery life with multi-band GPS; you're not quite ready to commit to the premium smartwatch price range.</p><p>The Garmin Epix Gen 2 is essentially a flagship Garmin watch, featuring a ton of useful features that users have liked over the years. For fitness users, it includes animated workouts, topographical maps, real-time stamina, and scoring methods for things like endurance and hill-running. It also features stress tracking, sleep monitoring, and the useful Garmin Coach feature that'll guide you toward your goals.</p><p>Those wanting the latest from Garmin will want to look at the recently launched Fenix 8, which has a few upgrades and a higher price tag. The main differences include an extra 10 hours of battery life when using multi-band GPS, a new UI, mic and speaker, and dynamic trip routing options. The Fenix 8 is normally only $100 more than this Epix Pro model, but this deal cuts a solid $350 off the purchase price—marking a great option for those seeking a premium smartwatch who don't want to drop over $1,000.</p><p>Garmin and many other brands also offer some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">best GPS smartwatch </a>options on the market, so if you're not quite sold on the Epix Pro, there are several other options to choose from that may be worth looking at.</p><p>With that being said, this is a solid discount on an otherwise solid watch, and without sacrificing many of the features that come with a premium price tag.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If the European Commission gets its way, the distinct separation between the iOS and Android ecosystems could start to fade away. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/dma100204-consultation-proposed-measures-requesting-interoperability-apples-ios-and-ipados-operating_en" target="_blank">document</a> published Wednesday, Dec. 18, the European Union's European Commission detailed reasons why it thinks Apple should open up iOS and iPadOS to work better with competition devices.</p><p>For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">Wear OS fans</a>, that could mean a world where you can AirDrop to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> or connect a Pixel Watch to an iPhone natively.</p><p>Basically, all those features that helped Apple create its "walled garden" ecosystem could be forced to become interoperable with Android and other platforms. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/document/download/8f28e456-5bd4-4b33-af95-b9f52aeb8a03_en?filename=DMA.100203%20-%20Overview%20of%20proposed%20measures.pdf" target="_blank">separate document</a>, the EU outlined the specific features that Apple should open up to third parties — and it's quite the list. AirDrop, the popular Apple file transfer service, is one massive inclusion. AirPlay, automatic audio switching, and media casting are a few others.</p><p>As an Android fan, it's hard not to get excited by the practical benefits of the EU's suggestions. What if instead of needing to carefully make sure your phone, set-top box, and speakers were all compatible, they "just worked?" Or, if you could make AirDrop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-likely-to-bring-android-quick-share-for-apple-devices">Quick Share</a>, AirPlay, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Google Cast</a> all interoperable. It sounds too good to be true, but if it <em>were </em>true, it'd change our novel conception of platforms and ecosystems as we know them.</p><p>The EU didn't put it this way, but the government is essentially trying to build a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> equivalent for mobile devices.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Matter is a unified standard supported by Apple, Google, Samsung, and others that aims to make all smart home devices work together. With a Matter device, you don't need to worry about whether a smart home product supports Apple Home, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings. In theory, they should all work together.</p><p>There's a key difference between what the EU is trying to do and what the Connectivity Standards Alliance did with Matter, though. For starters, Matter is something that tech companies did of their own volition, not because they were forced to by a governing body. There isn't a ton of precedent for what the EU is trying to do in this situation. Apple has spent its own research and development money to develop great features, and the EU thinks the Android platform is entitled to them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8" name="android-15-21.jpg" alt="Android 15 home page on Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, here's what the regulatory body had to say about AirPlay: "Apple shall implement an interoperability solution that provides third parties with access to the same AirPlay feature described in the preceding paragraph as available to Apple, in a way that is equally effective as the solution available to Apple."</p>
<h2 id="wait-the-e-u-wants-apple-to-do-what-2">Wait, the E.U. wants Apple to do what? </h2>
<p>As someone who has followed the tech industry for a while, I find that statement inconceivable. It sounds unreasonable to think that a tech company could be forced to make something it developed from scratch for its devices to be interoperable. The EU believes that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act's interoperability standards</a> require Apple to open up such features, but I'm not so sure. Even as an Android user standing to benefit from accessories and services working better with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, I can't help but wonder — is exclusivity ever okay?</p><p>To me, it is. Competition isn't about giving everyone the same resources and making every consumer electronics device exactly the same. It's about letting companies build their own products and ecosystems, thoughtfully making sure they don't use "lock-in" attempts to restrict consumer choice. If the market is functioning properly, brands like Apple, Samsung, Google, and others all have their own competing ecosystems. In the end, consumers choose which one they want to buy into.</p><p>It seems like the European Commission thinks that Apple is the only ecosystem-builder with exclusive features since these documents single out the Cupertino-based company. That's far from the case. In fact, I'd argue that Samsung has objectively the best ecosystem, integrating everything from smartphones to laptops to home appliances. Samsung has gone on the record saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-uis-next-release-is-delayed-and-samsung-wants-it-on-your-tvs-and-appliances">it wants One UI to reach TVs and appliances one day</a>.</p><p>Google isn't left out in the cold, either. It's reportedly planning to merge Android and ChromeOS to build a software superpower. Smart home devices, phones, tablets, and laptops are all sold with the company's software. I'd go as far as to say that Google Cast is far more reliable in my smart home than AirPlay ever was — I can cast media from my Pixel phone to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review" target="_blank">Nest Hub Max</a> to my Google TV HD in seconds without missing a beat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HxKwS6StM6dnQrFTEZkJVW" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-acer-chromebook-plus-spin-714-redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-pixel-tablet-stacked" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714, RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet, and Pixel Tablet all stacked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HxKwS6StM6dnQrFTEZkJVW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's the big misconception: Android doesn't need extra help. Quick Share is a viable alternative to AirDrop, and it's worth noting that Apple users regularly call AirDrop one of the least reliable Apple features to ever exist (this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8504389" target="_blank">official Apple support thread</a> is just one example). Google Cast is arguably a better version of AirPlay, with the latter being a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/11it0up/airplay_is_the_worst/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> routinely describe as "horrible."</p><p>Sure, if the EU successfully forces Apple to bring AirPlay, AirDrop, and other features to Android, it'll help the platform in the short term. Maybe it'll convince Apple users to switch, or perhaps it'll make it easier for Android users to stay. However, I think it'll hurt Android in the long run. The truth is, Android comes with a lot of great features — ones that I'm sure Apple users would love to have. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is one that comes to mind immediately.</p><p>It'll go both ways. Eventually, it'll be Android that's forced to concede a killer feature to iOS. Instead of lawmakers forcing companies to give up their best features for free, I'd rather them focus on the real monopolistic practices these companies partake in. For example, regulators could make it illegal for Google to pay Apple billions to get Google Search as the default search engine on iOS. Or, they could stop Google, Apple, and Samsung from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources">discouraging or preventing sideloading</a>.</p><p>To be clear, there are a ton of things regulators could do to increase competition between major tech companies. Forcing platforms to give away their best features just isn't the way to do it. iOS and Android both have their strengths and weaknesses, and really, they don't need extra help to compete with each other. Make it easier for consumers to switch and freely choose their devices, and they'll vote with their wallets.</p>

<ul><li>Google is seemingly working on a way to make initiating video calls faster in the Contacts app.</li><li>A tipster discovered that users can set a third-party app as their new default, which means starting a video call would be a tap away in your preferred app.</li><li>Google recently revamped its contact creation page, making it much faster to write down what matters most without all the clutter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted working on bringing additional support to its Contacts app that will enhance existing support for video calls.</p><p>During a deep dive into Google Contacts by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-contacts-streamline-connected-app-video-calls-apk-teardown-3509916/">Android Authority</a>), the tipster found that the company is working to make initiating video calls quicker than before. According to the tipster, the Contacts app is currently testing a new long-press option alongside the ability to set a third-party app as your "default" calling avenue.</p><p>The APK teardown shows that, after opening a contact's profile page, users can long-press the video call icon, which will produce a new sub-menu. This menu holds all of the available ways you can video call someone. The default option is "carrier video calling," while other apps like Google Meet can be seen, too. If you've connected with that same contact in a third-party app, it will show in this new menu.</p><p>The tipster adds that this small "video call" menu lets you set an app as your default for video calls. In this case, AssembleDebug uses WhatsApp as an example, stating that if it's set as your default, your contact's video call button will have a mini WhatsApp logo on it.</p><p>This subtle change is said to streamline the process as users can quickly tap the video call button to communicate via their preferred app. The tipster notes that this is much quicker than the current way, which requires users to dive into the "Connected Apps" tab on their contact's saved profile page.</p>

<p>The post adds that if you've saved multiple phone numbers for a person, long-pressing the video call will display each alongside the app you can call them at.</p><p>This slight rework of the Google Contacts video calling method was spotted in version <strong>4.46.53.70</strong>. There's no clear indication at the moment of when users could see this arrive in the stable build.</p><p>This change seems certain to make usingWhat seems certain with this change is that it will help make a user's usage of third-party apps even easier. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Popular Android apps</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> and Telegram both support video calls. This quick method of setting one as a default will help users who prefer those apps over the primary alternative, Google Meet.</p><p>Moreover, this small rework to video calling could pair well with the Contact app's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-just-gave-its-contact-creation-a-fresh-coat-of-paint">recent fresh coat of paint</a>. Google refreshed the process behind creating new contacts in the app, which incorporates a cleaner, more user-friendly approach to things. The key details are highlighted much sooner and more prominently when compared to the old way.</p><p>There is still the option of tinkering with those extra details; however, they're much further down and out of your way in an "Add fields" button.</p>

<p>Nothing has finally dropped the stable Nothing OS 3.0, its spin on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, with fresh features and smarter, shareable interactions.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-android-15-open-beta-start-detailed">kicking off its beta in November</a>, Nothing officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/22618-nothing-os-30-general-release" target="_blank">launched</a> Nothing OS 3.0. The timing is pretty clever, as Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">holding off on its Android 15 updates</a>, giving Nothing a chance to shine. The rollout for Nothing OS 3.0 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> and 2a will continue through the end of the year.</p><p>Alongside the OS launch, Nothing rolled out a revamped Gallery app with advanced search, handy editing tools like filters and markup, and suggestions.</p><p>Nothing OS 3.0 uses AI to boost your experience. It smartly organizes the app drawer for easier app discovery and prioritizes your go-to apps for faster access and smoother performance.</p><p>Additionally, the beta for Shared Widgets brings a fresh way to stay connected, letting you interact with friends and family right from your customizable lock screen. That said, Shared Widgets only work on Nothing devices, and you can only share square Photo Widgets.</p><p>Nothing OS 3.0 also brings in some handy productivity widgets, like the Countdown Widget, to help with time management. Plus, the AI-powered Smart Drawer sorts your apps automatically, making everything easier to find and access.</p><p>You also get tons of lock screen customization options. It also spruces up Quick Settings, Pop-up view, visuals, and typography for a more polished experience.</p><p>To grab the update, just head to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>System Update</strong> on your Phone 2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>. If it’s not there yet, it should show up in a few days. The stable version of Nothing OS 3.0 will eventually be rolling out to everyone by the end of 2024.</p><p>The stable Nothing OS 3.0 update will gradually roll out to more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> from Nothing. If you’ve got a Nothing Phone 1, Phone 2a Plus, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>, expect it to land in early 2025.</p>

<ul><li>A report cites a recently published Samsung patent that filed a concept for a 'curved-edge' display.</li><li>The design of the device in question seems similar to an Ultra-level phone (like the S23 Ultra); however Samsung details new improvements for durability.</li><li>Samsung made such displays popular, but they came with issues for screen protectors and accidental touches for the user.</li><li>A recent leak showed off the Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25 Plus alongside a rumor that the series could debut on January 22, 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Thin, flat phones are all the rage, but a newly discovered Samsung patent suggests it could revert that narrative.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/future-samsung-galaxy-smartphones-may-have-curve-edged-displays-recent-patent-shows/">MSPowerUser</a>, Samsung recently published a new patent regarding a "new" phone design (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/future-samsung-galaxy-smartphones-may-have-curve-edged-displays-recent-patent-shows/">Android Headlines</a>). The design that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20240414859">the document</a> details isn't anything new as the Korean OEM reportedly filed a concept for a "curved-edge display" Galaxy phone. The initial illustration of this design looks familiar as we're able to note the slight curved-edge on its frame, which would (ideally) bend the display downward a touch.</p><p>Moreover, the drawing in question seems to suggest a curved display for an Ultra-level phone as it shows an S Pen in its slot on the left corner. Another illustration then shows the internal component structure to support the stylus and its slot.</p><p>Such a design would make sense for an Ultra model as Samsung has given that device specifically the curved treatment before.</p><p>The publication spotted another aspect of this recently published patent that concerns Samsung's apparent "improved durability" and "leak prevention assembly." The folks at Android Headlines state that the improved "leak" prevention likely regards the sealant used within the phone.</p><p>Regarding durability, Samsung is potentially working on a stronger display that, when curved like this, isn't so prone to damage.</p>

<p>There are no clear signs about whether or not we could see the return of this curved Galaxy phone design. The post speculates that this could fall into our hands for the Galaxy S26 or S27 series, but both are a long ways away.</p><p>Users haven't had such an obvious curved-edge display since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is ever-so-slight, but it was a move toward the flat display trend. Android Central once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poll-flat-or-curved-display">polled its readers</a> about their preference between flat or curved display and the result was unanimously in favor of the former. While you could say Samsung popularized the curved display — and, for whatever reason they scream "premium" — these screens come with issues.</p><p>Screen protectors have a tough time conforming to such a curved structure and there's always the accidental touch when holding it.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 series coming up, we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-to-come-on-january-22-2025-leaked-image-suggests">leaked renders</a> that continuously point toward a thin, flat era. It seems as though Samsung is doing this to better compete with Apple, which is something it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">done considerably in other areas</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the next flagship trio from Samsung is rumored to arrive on January 22, 2025.</p>

<p>We may call it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> on the market, but the Pixel Tablet isn&apos;t perfect. The device&apos;s thick bezels aren&apos;t for everyone, and there&apos;s no audio jack for plugging in wired headphones. There are also no options for first-party keyboard attachments or styli, and folks looking for laptop-level power may want to consider one of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablets</a>.</p><p>But with that being said, if you&apos;re a fan of the Google ecosystem and you just want something fun and capable enough to handle most tasks with ease, then the Pixel tablet is a winner.

<ul><li>After Google released its second Android 16 Developer Preview, a discovery was made about a new "screen-off fingerprint unlock."</li><li>Once toggled, the feature lets users unlock their devices without turning the display on first; however, it seems restricted to the Pixel 9 series.</li><li>Android 16 Developer Preview 2 brings enhancements to battery life and other areas of performance.</li><li>Android 16 is expected to arrive in Q2 2025, but a beta is said to begin in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google continues to push ahead with Android 16, but a recent discovery shows a new feature for its recent flagships.</p><p>The latest Developer Preview for the next major OS is here and Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-screen-off-fingerprint-unlock-3510174/">Android Authority</a>) found a new fingerprint function for Pixels. According to Rahman, the new "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" seems restricted to the Pixel 9, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL</a>. The feature exists within the Pixel settings for Fingerprint Unlock specifically under the "Device Unlock" page.</p><p>Opening this brings up the standard fingerprint credentials, such as which fingers you have on file for unlock.</p><p>However, under the "when using fingerprint unlock" line, Google has added the screen-off usage toggle in Android 16 DP 2. The company's on-device description reads, "use fingerprint unlock even when the screen is off."</p><p>Rahman offered a brief demo of this feature. When toggled on, users can place their thumb or finger on their display (when it's off) to unlock their device. Upon touching, the device's lock screen briefly shows to confirm the print before opening the app you last left open or your home screen.</p><p>What's more, it seems users must place their print (roughly) in the area of the lock screen's in-display fingerprint scanner. It's not clear if the device will pick up your biometrics if you're placing your thumb/index finger elsewhere on the device considering the scanner is placed lower-middle on the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:441px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:136.05%;"><img id="3XzwyzTitA9MhiaL3As6s8" name="android-16-developer-preview-2-screen-off-fingerprint-toggle" alt="The Pixel 9 series could grab a "screen-off" fingerprint feature in Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3XzwyzTitA9MhiaL3As6s8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="441" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman adds that this feature <em>could </em>be exclusive to the Pixel 9 due to its addition of an ultrasonic scanner. This is a piece of technology Samsung popped into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, too.</p><p>The first Android 16 Developer Preview arrived in November and testers are beginning to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-2-released">unravel their second helping</a>. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">first iteration</a> offered a glimpse into new features and APIs for Android 16, the second preview offers battery life and performance enhancements for devices. Google highlighted its improvement of "adaptive refresh rates," stating this should aid devices with battery life and improve visuals for apps.</p><p>Background tasks in Android 16 are getting a rework, too, with the company detailing how active apps gain stronger priority. Additionally, "outdated methods for prioritizing tasks" have been retired in this next OS version.</p><p>Google's earlier testing of the next Android OS is jarring, but it said as much during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-gemini-android-studio-sdk-updates">future of SDK Release</a> announcement. Android 16 is staring at a Q2 2025 release and, according to its timeline, that could happen sometime after April 2025. The first Android 15 beta is slated for January.</p>

The brand, still a minor player in the overall market for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, found recent success with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr line</a> of budget and flagship foldables. However, a patent dispute between Sony Ericsson and Motorola Mobility (owned by Lenovo) could eliminate the availability of Motorola handsets in the U.S., according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-finds-lenovo-smartphones-infringe-ericsson-patents-2024-12-17/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</p><p>In an initial ruling Tuesday, Dec. 17, a judge for the  U.S. International Trade Commission decided that Motorola's phones infringe on key 5G patents held by Sony Ericsson. The smartphones in question include those in the Moto G, Edge, and Razr lineups. If the initial ruling by the ITC stands, imports of Motorola phones in the U.S. could be banned, all but eliminating their availability.</p><p>The ITC will issue a final ruling in April 2025, and if its initial decision is upheld, a ban on Motorola phones in the U.S. is likely to happen. That would have ripple effects throughout the U.S. market, because Lenovo made up 14% of the country's mobile market share as of Q3 2024, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/us-smartphone-market-share/">Counterpoint Research</a>. Crucially, some of the brand's most successful smartphones are involved in the dispute.</p>

<p>Motorola's absence would leave a hole in the market, notably where clamshell foldables are concerned. There simply isn't another player making affordable foldables in the U.S. like Motorola did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr 2023</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>. It's possible that instead of elevating a growing brand like OnePlus, a ban on Motorola phones would just make the big three of Apple, Samsung, and Google even more dominant.</p><p>In November 2024, one industry report indicated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-and-oneplus-are-crucial-to-foldable-market">a major competitor in the foldable market was considering an exit</a>. Entering 2025, we could be down at least one foldable manufacturer if that report turns out to be accurate. Motorola could represent another, and it's possible that no one steps up to replace it. We could be back where we started, with Samsung as the only major clamshell foldable manufacturer and no need to innovate due to a lack of competition.</p><p>It seems like patent disputes in the mobile sector are becoming increasingly common. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-is-returning-to-europe-after-resolving-patent-disputes">OPPO and Vivo recently ended a dispute with Nokia</a> about 5G patents, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-another-patent-dispute-germany-report">OnePlus is now in hot water again in Germany</a> over a similar issue. While it's great that brands are being held accountable for their use of patents, it's a shame that these decisions only decrease the number of phones that are available for consumers.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-phones-could-be-banned-how-we-got-here-2">Motorola phones could be banned: How we got here</h2>
<p>If that sounds familiar, it should. In recent years, multiple Chinese brands have become involved in patent disputes surrounding their uses of 5G technology in smartphones. Notably, Motorola itself is fighting the same battle with Sony Ericsson in multiple markets. Initial court decisions in Brazil and Columbia already ruled in favor of Sony Ericsson, and more legal battles are taking place in South America and the United Kingdom, per Reuters.</p><p>How did we get here? The tide started to turn in Sony Ericsson's favor earlier this month when an ITC judge rejected Motorola's best defense against the patent infringement claims. Motorola said that a 2011 license agreement between it and Sony Ericsson covered use of Ericsson technology in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Edge</a>, and Razr phones. In other words, the company isn't denying it used the technology — it's arguing that it was allowed to.</p><p>The problem with Motorola's claim is that the 2011 agreement was penned ages ago, before the company was sold to Google and then sold <em>again</em> to Lenovo. More importantly, a clause in the licensing agreement explained that Motorola would be able to use the licensed technology in "commercially reasonable updates or extensions of such Licensed products." The ITC judge ruled in favor of Ericsson, tossing aside Motorola's argument on the basis that none of the three phone lineups in question even existed at the time the 2011 agreement was reached (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ipfray.com/itc-judge-rejects-lenovos-most-important-defense-against-ericsson-2011-license-agreement-doesnt-cover-current-motorola-phones/" target="_blank">IP Fray</a>).</p>

<p>Motorola could explore other legal avenues to block the move — lawyers for Lenovo previously argued that the licensing agreement was covered by U.K. law, and suggested that the ITC should wait for U.K. courts to rule before issuing its own ruling. Of course, in light of the ITC's preliminary decision, that didn't happen. And if the ITC's ruling is upheld, Motorola phones could be off the shelves for the foreseeable future.</p>
