<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for an affordable, versatile laptop that won&apos;t sacrifice performance; you&apos;ve liked past devices with Chrome OS; you want something that includes some of Google&apos;s newest AI features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a laptop with more than 128GB of storage; 10 hours of battery life isn&apos;t enough to suit your needs.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-plus-515-review">Acer Chromebook Plus 515</a> performs well amongst its peers around the $400 price point, so it&apos;s honestly a pretty appealing pick at $100 off. From its 15.6-inch, 1920x1080 resolution screen to its lightweight yet durable design, it&apos;s not hard to figure out why it&apos;s a good pick for students across grade levels. It also comes with two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, an HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>Purchasing the Chromebook Plus 515 from Best Buy will also net you a free three-month trial of Photoshop, and you can also knock the price down even more with a trade-in if that appeals to you. </p><p>This laptop doesn&apos;t have a microSD slot and some find certain features not up to par with their needs. For instance, 128GB of storage may be too little for some, as can be said of the roughly 10 hours of battery life.</p><p>Still, this is a pretty solid Chromebook for most users, especially if you&apos;re able to snag it during this back-to-school sale.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps and Waze now share an incident reporting feature, allowing drivers to report road conditions like construction, lane closures, obstacles, and police activity.</li><li>Maps will also highlight buildings in red as you approach, show main entrances with a green marker, and display nearby parking spots.</li><li>Meanwhile, Waze adds new camera alerts and features lock screen navigation and road hazard alerts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps and Waze might share a common base, but they have unique features for different users. Now, Google is adding one of Waze&apos;s top safety features to Maps.</p><p>The search giant has rolled out new safety features for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a> and Waze, as per the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/maps-waze-new-features-information-on-the-go/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. One big Google Maps update is the long-awaited incident reporting, a key feature that made Waze popular, now available on both apps.</p><p>This update makes it easier for users to report and share important road conditions like construction zones, lane closures, obstacles, and police activity. With a new incident reporting button, marked by a yellow triangle, drivers can quickly share details about any road hazards they come across.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:382px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:192.67%;"><img id="di3JwyM5ADzVxQewQdvjVo" name="Google-maps-incident-reporting.png" alt="Google maps incident reporting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/di3JwyM5ADzVxQewQdvjVo.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="382" height="736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:398px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:180.40%;"><img id="9DPXoLDhwhfrhcUxFkEdAo" name="Google-maps-incident-reporting-tools.png" alt="Google maps incident reporting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9DPXoLDhwhfrhcUxFkEdAo.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="398" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>This collaborative feature will help other drivers make informed decisions and avoid potential disruptions on their routes.</p><p>By sharing incident reports between Maps and Waze, both apps get a boost. Plus, you can see which app the report came from.</p><p>With Google owning both platforms, it makes sense to integrate handy features like incident reporting.</p><p>Google Maps is also making it easier to find your way with new features. As you get close to your destination, the building will light up in red, and a green marker will show you the main entrance. Furthermore, it will show nearby parking spots to make your trip smoother.</p>

<p>The incident reporting and parking assistance features will roll out over the next few weeks on Android and iOS devices, cars with Google’s built-in systems, and popular car interfaces like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and Apple CarPlay.</p><p>At the same time, Waze is adding a bunch of new camera alerts covering speed cameras, red light cameras, seatbelt checks, and mobile phone use. This feature will be available worldwide on both Android and iOS devices.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:405px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:181.48%;"><img id="cGuADpCoT2gTETiHmtRAdJ" name="waze-camera-alerts.png" alt="Waze camera alerts and traffic updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGuADpCoT2gTETiHmtRAdJ.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="405" height="735" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:418px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:176.32%;"><img id="mTukUmHe3WfxWqTqqhGxRJ" name="waze-traffic-alerts.png" alt="Waze camera alerts and traffic updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mTukUmHe3WfxWqTqqhGxRJ.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="418" height="737" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Waze is also adding lock screen navigation and road hazard alerts. While these might be more useful on Maps, they’re still handy for Waze users. They’re great for passenger-mode travel or familiar routes that might have unexpected obstacles.</p><p>Finally, Waze is adding a new social feature that lets users share real-time traffic information with friends. When driving through areas affected by big events like concerts, parades, or sports games, you’ll get notifications about the event and any road closures. You can then share this information with friends to help them avoid traffic jams.</p>

<p>OnePlus unveiled the Nord 4 at a global launch event in Milan, Italy on July 16. The phone is now on sale in the same regions as erstwhile Nord devices. The Nord 4 is available in 8GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB, and 12GB/256GB storage variants; the 128GB model uses UFS 3.1 storage, with the 256GB editions offering UFS 4.0 storage as default.</p><p>What&apos;s particularly interesting is that the Nord 4 starts off at just ₹29,999 ($358) for the 8GB/128GB edition, and that&apos;s less than the Nord 3&apos;s ₹33,999 ($406). The 8GB/256GB model is debuting at ₹32,999 ($394), and the 12GB/256GB edition retails for ₹35,999 ($430). There is a 512GB model of the device, but that isn&apos;t launching in India. OnePlus is rolling out the usual launch offers, and you can get decent discounts if you pick up the device right now. </p><p>Although OnePlus started selling the OnePlus 12R in the U.S. starting this year, the Nord 4 isn&apos;t making its way to the country. It is instead sold in India, the U.K., Germany, France, and a smattering of global markets. In the U.K., the device costs £429 ($546) for the 12GB/256GB variant, and £479 ($610) for the 16GB/512GB edition. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EgD9WR6Ke8kYL6oT3Q24T7" name="oneplus-nord-4-3.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgD9WR6Ke8kYL6oT3Q24T7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve always liked the designs of the Nord series, but OnePlus outdid itself this time. The Nord 4 sees the return of all-metal phones, and it is fantastic. Granted, most devices in this segment use an aluminum mid-frame anyway, but you usually get a glass or polycarbonate back, and it just doesn&apos;t have the same in-hand feel as a metal-clad device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4fMh8wH7iCLkbnrziv58QA" name="oneplus-nord-4-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4fMh8wH7iCLkbnrziv58QA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Silver variant I&apos;m using has a ridged pattern that looks very cool, but it is just etched onto the metal, and it doesn&apos;t actually have ridges running across the back. While I also like the Oasis Green option, the Silver model does a better job accentuating the metal design of the phone.</p>

<p>I was initially worried that the all-metallic chassis would interfere with signal strength — that&apos;s one of the main reasons why brands choose to go with glass or plastic designs — but that hasn&apos;t been an issue at all. Antenna lines are present on the sides and on the back, and the Nord 4 delivered a consistent signal that&apos;s in line with most other phones I used this year; I didn&apos;t run into any issues while streaming content or playing games on the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sYQUbPN5wNAY4xRSM55NQ6" name="oneplus-nord-4-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sYQUbPN5wNAY4xRSM55NQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the chassis itself is made out of metal, the Nord 4 has a glass window that covers the top portion at the back, and this gives the device an added design flair. The glass window immediately brings earlier Pixels to mind, and it continues to be an elegant way to differentiate the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MiEzeQod35T5CYhHPrTg35" name="oneplus-nord-4-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MiEzeQod35T5CYhHPrTg35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has flat sides, but the metal back curves where it meets the mid-frame, and it makes holding and using the Nord 4 noticeably easier. While the device is 7g heavier than the Nord 3 at 199g, it is actually more comfortable to hold, and I wasn&apos;t anywhere as worried about it taking a tumble. The power and volume buttons are on the right and have good tactility, and the alert slider sits to the left.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kgo8EwFQMfpHqNQnv4fZf5" name="oneplus-nord-4-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgo8EwFQMfpHqNQnv4fZf5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue on the design front is that the in-screen module sits a little too low on the screen, so it makes accessing the sensor awkward when using the phone one-handed. OnePlus started adding an IR blaster to its devices a year ago, and the feature is intact on the Nord 4. Another addition is IP65 water resistance, and while it isn&apos;t on the same level as IP68, it&apos;s great to see the device has some level of protection in this regard.</p><p>Overall, the metallic chassis combined with the in-hand feel allows the Nord 4 to stand out considerably. I&apos;m excited that metallic phones are making a comeback, and this is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a> in terms of design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xbP46eeRA9S74AhZPdE3H8" name="oneplus-nord-4-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbP46eeRA9S74AhZPdE3H8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is using the same 6.74-inch AMOLED panel as last year, and you get the same 120Hz refresh, 2772 x 1240 resolution, and HDR10+ rendering. The brand integrated Ultra HDR into its devices last year, and this feature is available on the Nord 4 as well.</p>
<p>The noticeable difference is that the panel can get up to 2,100 nits when viewing HDR content, and while it doesn&apos;t go anywhere that high in regular use, it is still plenty bright, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this area even under harsh sunlight. Colors are similarly great, and you get decent customizability when it comes to changing the color balance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VDe5QTQryjDxNu5bso2ue6" name="oneplus-nord-4-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VDe5QTQryjDxNu5bso2ue6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The onboard sound is quite good too, and it is serviceable if you&apos;re just playing casual games on the device. When it comes to customization, you get the same always-on styles as the OnePlus 12, and you get to change the system font, icons, accent colors, and just about everything else.</p><p>Although the panel itself hasn&apos;t changed, it gets brighter in daily use, and it still offers fantastic colors and contrast levels.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YW9giFgCrsjZDBmJY6Fst5" name="oneplus-nord-4-20.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YW9giFgCrsjZDBmJY6Fst5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nord 4 is powered by the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3, and it is Qualcomm&apos;s latest attempt to claw back market share in this segment. After fielding outdated designs with old cores, Qualcomm is making amends with the 7+ Gen 3; the chipset uses the latest Cortex X4 alongside A720 and A520, and the difference is noticeable.</p><p>The Nord 4 has plenty of power in daily use, and I didn&apos;t see any lag during mundane tasks. It does a great job while gaming as well, and while it doesn&apos;t run demanding titles at their highest settings, there isn&apos;t noticeable jitter at medium settings.</p>

<p><br>
The biggest advantage is that it doesn&apos;t overheat to any noticeable degree even during extended gaming sessions, and that is a welcome sight. Most other phones in this category heat up considerably after an hour of gaming, and that just isn&apos;t an issue with the Nord 4. That said, the stability score is on the lower end of the scale; the phone managed just 53.5% stability in 3DMark&apos;s Nomad Endurance test, and most other phones in this segment manage 70% on average.</p>
<p>Similar to other mid-rangers, the Nord 4 is available in three configurations: a base 8GB/128GB model, an 8GB/256GB version, and a 12GB/256GB edition. The 128GB storage variant uses the older UFS 3.1 module, while the 256GB versions come with UFS 4.0 as standard. This is because UFS 4.0 storage starts off at 256GB, and there aren&apos;t mainstream vendors making 128GB modules using the latest storage tech.</p><p>You don&apos;t see much in the way of real-world difference between the two now, but my recommendation would be to get the 256GB version anyway — you&apos;ll need the additional storage. Outside of that, there are no issues on the hardware side; the phone gets Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, AptX HD codecs, dual-band GPS, and a decent vibration motor with detailed feedback.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p8DHGqQ3agQPzk2WZqCgB7" name="oneplus-nord-4-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p8DHGqQ3agQPzk2WZqCgB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is where the Nord 4 truly comes into its own, and thanks to a larger 5500mAh battery and switch to a 4nm node, the phone has meaningful gains in this area. I easily got a day and half worth of use between charges, and battery anxiety just isn&apos;t a consideration on this phone.</p><p>And when you need to charge it, the phone takes just under 30 minutes to charge the massive battery via 100W. The bundled charger is one of the best around, and while there are modest gains over the Nord 3, the fact that you&apos;re getting a bigger battery is a sizeable achievement. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-nord-4-cameras"><span>OnePlus Nord 4: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oACsvexM7Mnb3YKygbdsy7" name="oneplus-nord-4-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oACsvexM7Mnb3YKygbdsy7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus likes to reuse camera modules across devices, and the Nord 4 gets a 50MP Sony LYT-600 sensor that&apos;s joined by an 8MP wide-angle lens. Thankfully, there&apos;s no macro module this time around, and that is a positive move — it&apos;s good to see manufacturers not cluttering up phones with useless lenses.</p><p>The camera interface is identical to what you get on every OnePlus phone; the shooting modes are available in a ribbon at the bottom, and you have the usual toggles and filters. What&apos;s interesting this time is that the OxygenOS 14.1 build adds AI-assisted tools that are similar to Google&apos;s Best Take on the Pixels.</p><p>Video recording is better than previous years as you can now shoot 4K footage at 60fps, but the wide-angle lens is limited to 1080p, making it a poor choice in this area. Other than that, I didn&apos;t see any differences between the interface on the Nord 3 and this year&apos;s offering.</p>

<p>Shots in daylight have plenty of detail and good color rendition, with OnePlus opting to go with an overly saturated look. There&apos;s good dynamic range and white balance, and foliage is rendered accurately without any overt smoothening. The main module does 2x digital zoom, and the resultant shots are decent enough in their own right.</p><p>The Nord 4 does a great job in low-light scenarios as well, producing shots with good vibrancy and minimal noise levels. There are noticeable gains from last year in this area, and that in itself is a sizeable achievement. The wide-angle lens is better than I imagined, and while it doesn&apos;t quite manage the same caliber of shots in demanding lighting situations, it comes close.</p><p>It may not be the best in this segment — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> is much better — but the Nord 4 manages to deliver consistent images, and that matters more in daily usage.</p>

<p>There isn&apos;t much to talk about on the software side of things that I haven&apos;t already covered with the OnePlus 12 and 12R reviews, so if you&apos;re interested in seeing how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-7-best-new-features-in-oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a> holds up in daily use, I&apos;d recommend taking a look at those posts. Like those devices, the Nord 4 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and you get the usual OxygenOS UI and the associated accouterments.</p>
<p>That said, the one thing that&apos;s new in the OxygenOS 14.1 build is AI integration. You get an AI summary, translator tool, and the ability to transcribe notes automatically, and of the three, the one I actually used was the notes transcriber. However, notes are limited to five minutes in length, so it isn&apos;t anywhere as good as Pixel&apos;s built-in recorder, but it is a decent showing if you dictate notes on the go.</p>

<p>OnePlus did a good job ensuring its devices didn&apos;t have much in the way of bloatware in the past, but with every new device I use these days, there&apos;s increased bloatware. The Nord 4 has a lot of pre-installed apps out of the box, and that is just annoying. You can uninstall everything, but still, it detracts from the overall experience.</p><p>Thankfully, that&apos;s about the only issue on the software side of things. The interface is fluid and doesn&apos;t have any slowdowns, and there&apos;s extensive customizability. But what I like the most is that the update guarantee; the Nord 4 will pick up four Android OS updates and six years of software patches, and that&apos;s longer than any other OnePlus phone available today.</p><p>Nord devices haven&apos;t received updates on time, so we&apos;ll just have to wait and see if OnePlus changes tack this year. Other than that, there isn&apos;t much to fault when it comes to the software.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> is the obvious choice if you want a value-focused phone with standout performance. It is better at gaming, but the cameras aren&apos;t anywhere as good, and it just doesn&apos;t have the same design presence. It won&apos;t get as many software updates either, but at ₹27,999 ($335), it is much more affordable.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a phone with a unique design</li><li>You need reliable performance with no overheating issues</li><li>You need great battery life and fast charging</li><li>You take a lot of photos and videos</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need clean software</li><li>You want timely updates</li></ul>
<p>I used the Nord 4 for a week, and I couldn&apos;t find any faults with the device. That is a major achievement in and of itself, and honestly, OnePlus did all the right things with the device. The switch to an all-metallic chassis gives the Nord 4 a unique character that you don&apos;t get with any other phone, and that two-tone design with the glass window is exquisite.</p><p>The rest of the hardware is similarly great: the 120Hz AMOLED panel has vibrant colors and great contrast, the battery easily lasts a day and a half, and the cameras are terrific. The hardware is particularly interesting; after ceding ground to MediaTek, Qualcomm finally delivered a competent chipset with the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3, and it is able to hold its own against the best phones in this category.</p><p>But it&apos;s the value that makes the Nord 4 enticing; the phone has considerable upgrades over its predecessor, but you&apos;re not paying any extra, and that alone makes it worthy of recommendation.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google has redesigned some elements of its popular file management app.</li><li>Users will be able to view their recent files in the form of a carousel, just like their Memories on the Google Photos app.</li><li>The new change is seen in the latest beta and some official versions of the app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Files by Google app is getting a nifty new look when you glance through your recent files, which is very similar to what we have seen on the Google Photos app for quite a while now.</p><p>Until now, users were greeted with the "Recents" and "Categories" sections in the app when they opened the Files by Google app on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. The Recents tab is always used to showcase folders like Camera, Download, Screenshots, and Downloads (Documents) in grid form with a slight preview of the contents. </p><p>It is now changing with a new update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/29/google-files-recents-carousel/">9to5Google</a>), and the same Recent section will now greet you with a Stories-like carousel quite similar to what we see on Google Photos&apos; "Memories" up top.</p>
<p>Your handset&apos;s recent files can now be viewed in a carousel format. Rectangular cards show up as previews, and when tapped, the file/image opens in the full-screen view. </p><p>The cards are further accompanied by a three-dot menu, which lets you share, send to trash, or mark the respective file as "Starred." A total of ten cards can be viewed in the new carousel, after which users can hit the "see all" button on the top right to open up recent files segregated according to folder names.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="bRGZ3Z3NLR86c9wVHrEF36" name="Files-by-Google-new.jpg" alt="Files by Google New" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bRGZ3Z3NLR86c9wVHrEF36.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">New </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.51%;"><img id="KhLeegxBmMuzFwsE7RkPj" name="Files-by-Google-Old.jpg" alt="Files by Google Old view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KhLeegxBmMuzFwsE7RkPj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="338" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Old </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>While 9to5 points out that these new changes were spotted in the latest beta of the Files by Google app, we could also see the carousel in action with the same app bearing the <strong>1.4237.652465286.1-release</strong> version. Google Photos is one of the apps that showcase stories, such as the carousel feature; the Play Store also showcases similar cards in the popular "For You" section.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to see Google make these adjustments and provide a consistent user experience across all of its products. There&apos;s also the exciting aspect of these improvements occurring just before the official release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p>

Specifically, the code offers a glimpse at the extension&apos;s permissions, which detail the use of your Spotify account&apos;s "playlists, playback history, and preferences."</p><p>Of course, this is all relevant information for Gemini to fulfill a user&apos;s request through the music streaming app. The permission page also states that "parts of your conversation" involving Spotify may be shared to "personalize" your music experience.</p><p>In the site&apos;s test, typing "@Spotify" in Gemini&apos;s pop-up window, followed by the name of a song, initiated the extension. The time it takes for Gemini to understand the request to pull up Spotify to play the song is reportedly a bit lengthy. But that&apos;s likely because it needs to fulfill the song request <em>and </em>pull up the app, in addition to the fact that it hasn&apos;t officially rolled out yet.</p><p>Nevertheless, the extension does trigger a Spotify song to play based on your request and account preferences, after the long wait. Tthe publication states that the extension can play requested music through the Spotify extension in the background without requiring the main app.</p>

<p>The latest deep dive offers a much more insightful glimpse at how Spotify&apos;s Gemini extension could perform after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-extension-potential-code-strings-discovered">brief mentions last time</a>. Early strings of code suggested that the extension would alert users to a music session by stating "Starting to Play on Spotify." The publication&apos;s app teardown now shows that the app may display the name of the song followed by "on Spotify."</p><p>What&apos;s more, both discoveries involved its operational abilities on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. It&apos;s still uncertain if this will work for those using Gemini on desktops. It also seems that Google is giving users more options for music streaming through Gemini as the AI model recently picked up one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">for YouTube Music</a> on Android and desktop.</p><p>Gemini&apos;s musical abilities are just one of a few AI extensions the company has planned. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-home-extensions-spotted">recent report suggests</a> Google is preparing to bring an extension for Google Home, the Phone app, and "Utilities."</p>

<ul><li>On X (formerly Twitter), OnePlus has started teasing an "Apex Edition" of its Open foldable phone.</li><li>The new edition sees the phone reimagined in a fiery red colorway, though its specs and pricing will remain hidden until its August 7 debut.</li><li>We're still eagerly awaiting the OnePlus Open 2, however, rumors claim it won't arrive in 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is gearing up for a product variant<em> </em>reveal as teasers ramp up regarding its first foldable.</p><p>The Chinese company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/oneplus/status/1818995096240669028">posted a teaser on X</a> for an "Apex Edition" for the OnePlus Open (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-open-apex-edition-crimson-shadow-color-improved-specs-coming-soon_id161047">PhoneArena</a>). OnePlus calls the new red leather backing a "stunning Crimson Shadow," that aims to complement the pre-existing Emerald Dusk and Voyager Black colorways.</p><p>The post adds that the full reveal of the OnePlus Open Apex Edition will take place on August 7. Unfortunately, we&apos;ll have to wait until then for its price and tech specs. We know generally how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> looks and performs from our review, but it&apos;s possible OnePlus could differentiate its special edition with extra RAM or storage, as the site speculates.</p><p>OnePlus also specified that the Apex Edition will be granted three major Android OS releases and four years of security updates from launch. That&apos;s one year less than the OnePlus Open&apos;s other two colorways at launch; the Apex Edition&apos;s support will expire at the same time.</p><p>We don&apos;t know what OnePlus will charge for the Apex Edition, but a price increase is likely. It originally launched for $1,699 / CA$2,299 / ₹139,999.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A supreme form to rule them all. The #OnePlusOpen Apex Edition in stunning Crimson Shadow is coming August 7.<a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1818995096240669028">August 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While this Apex Edition teaser is exciting in its own right, we&apos;re still left waiting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a>. Rumors suggest that the foldable successor might not launch in 2024 due to OPPO taking a step back about launching the Find N5 series. Considering OPPO and OnePlus are sister companies under BBK Electronics, their devices (at times) overlap in terms of internal components and the like.</p><p>Those rumored continued to say the OnePlus Open 2 may rock Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, which would see it rolling out no sooner than late 2024, or more likely early 2025.</p><p>Taking that extra year could help push the OnePlus Open 2 into the limelight once again as the company looks to beef it up. We&apos;ll have to wait and see what it looks like, so for now, we have the Apex Edition to look forward to. The current-gen Open is already one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market.</p>

There might be millions of people using Meta Quest, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR headsets each and every month, but it&apos;s still not enough players to keep most multiplayer games properly populated. Yet, if I scroll through the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a>, a significant number of them are multiplayer-only games.</p>

<p>Multiplayer games keep people coming back again and again — especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-offers-vr-battle-royal-experiences-for-everyone">if they&apos;re regularly updated</a> like Population: One or Contractors Showdown — because they tend to offer a better long-term value to players not willing to shell out money for new games every month.</p><p>But those games need consistent player counts to keep people coming back regularly. Servers and updates are expensive, so multiplayer games simply can&apos;t survive without a regular stream of income through in-game microtransactions or something similar. </p><p>This presents an obvious conundrum. So, instead of continuing to launch more multiplayer-only games, developers will likely have to shift strategies to stay afloat.</p><p>That&apos;s where games like Zero Caliber 2 come in. With an 8-hour single-player campaign that can optionally be played co-op with up to 4 players, plus a 10-player multiplayer mode that has built-in mod support, Zero Caliber 2 has a real chance to keep players interested whether they want to play online or not.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s get this out of the way first. I didn&apos;t play the original Zero Caliber, although I&apos;ve heard good things about it. In all the right ways, it sounds like Zero Caliber 2 is the perfect sequel based on the description of the original and the 3,600 reviews for it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/3591949650852844/">Meta Horizon store</a>.</p><p>In essence, Zero Caliber 2 is akin to the VR version of the latest Call of Duty games. It features an in-depth multi-hour campaign filled with voice-acted characters, scripted sequences, incredible weapon handling and sound effects, and more action than you might expect in a standalone Quest game.</p><p>It&apos;s amazing because, if I were to imagine what a dream VR release would be in August 2024, a new shooting game isn&apos;t what would have made my list. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/contractors-showdown-meta-quest-3">Contractors Showdown</a> already scratched my itch for an amazing multiplayer battle royale game, and older titles like the original Contractors, the free-to-play battle royale Population: One, and several others are still going strong.</p><p>Back in January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/tired-of-vr-shooting-games">I lamented</a> that we already had too many VR shooting games, but then Zero Caliber 2 came along to cut my narrative off at the knees.</p><p>Nothing wrong with a good surprise, right?</p>

<p>Zero Caliber 2 is the VR shooting game I had no idea I wanted. I&apos;m not a Call of Duty player and I generally couldn&apos;t care less about any game of a similar vein. Yet, Zero Caliber 2 is one of my favorite VR games so far this year.</p><p>For starters, the game exudes a level of polish the VR industry needs to keep growing in a year with a few disappointing big-name titles like Stranger Things and the very early access Attack on Titan game that was just released. It&apos;s also a single-player game with the option of playing the entire campaign co-op alongside friends if they&apos;re available.</p><p>The amount of action in this game is truly awe-inspiring, and I marveled at the level of detail in each level as I made my way through neighborhoods, city streets, and harbors filled with battleships. The first time a pair of jets flew over my head, I actually ducked, and it was these kinds of scripted sequences and momentous events that kept me wondering what was around the next corner.</p>

<p>Visually, it&apos;s one of the more impressive games I&apos;ve seen on Quest to date. It&apos;s incredibly crisp and clean since it runs at a crazy high resolution and even the assets and textures are higher quality than you&apos;ll find on most Quest games.</p>

<p>The introductory level takes place in a neighborhood besieged by a terrorist organization. As you make your way from house to house, the level of excitement continues to grow as your adrenaline kicks in.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing quite so satisfying as clearing out enemies hiding in a house, moving quickly from room to room before they make their move to get you first. It&apos;s harrowing and unnerving, especially being in such a domestic situation in an otherwise heavily military-themed story.</p><p>Aside from the ziplines and impressive scripted sequences, I loved the fact that you could take nearly anything the enemies were using. From grenades to guns, weapons attachments, ammo, etc. There was no shortage of choices at my disposal.</p>

<p>While I experienced this portion of the campaign alone, I enjoyed almost the entirety of the rest of it alongside the father/son duo of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rufftalkvr.com/">Ruff Talk VR podcast</a>.</p><p>Being able to join alongside friends in a campaign like this made it feel even more authentic. While there are plenty of action movie tropes found along the way, this isn&apos;t a game that makes you feel like an unstoppable Rambo-type character, especially if you play at higher difficulties.</p><p>Rather, having a friend (or two or three) alongside creates the feeling of a squad, letting you be more strategic while taking out the terrorist threat. That&apos;s vitally important if you&apos;re going to finish the campaign, again, especially at higher difficulty levels.</p><p>The comradery even extends to when your character drops to zero HP in the game. As they lay there on the ground, you can physically grab their hand and pull them up, bringing them back into the action in the most VR way possible.</p>

<p>As you make your way through the story, you&apos;ll come across over 60 different weapons, all with realistic handling and sound effects. Now, I&apos;m not a gun nut, and I hardly know the difference between any of the rifles in the game — I&apos;m not sure I could even give you the letters and numbers of any of them correctly off the top of my head — but the level of detail in these weapons is exquisite.</p><p>To top it off, the game&apos;s weapon customization mechanics feel incredibly realistic and satisfying. Need to find a better scope for your current gun? Just look at the weapon, rip the old scope off, and attach the new one. The same goes for any enhancement you&apos;ll find along the way, from silencers to lasers, grips, extended magazines, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9UsCPym8a8TAvbgU3m8KyA" name="zero-caliber-2-official-screenshot-ice.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Zero Caliber 2 running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UsCPym8a8TAvbgU3m8KyA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t have the chance to play the standard 10-player multiplayer mode — again, I&apos;m not usually interested in those types of modes or games — but it&apos;s there in case you like it. The built-in mod support also means that the community can develop new and interesting modes, mechanics, and maps, leaving the developers at Xreal to steer the overall ship instead of being heads down on expensive big updates.</p><p>As Zero Caliber 2 is now available on the Meta Horizon store, I can&apos;t wait to play through the campaign with more friends who are planning to pick it up. Spending 30 minutes running through a mission together after a busy day at work is a ton of fun and a great way to wind down without having to go anywhere.</p><p>My biggest hope is that we&apos;ll continue to see games like this debut throughout the year and beyond. There&apos;s nothing sadder in the gaming world than getting excited over an amazing game only to buy it and have a hard time playing because it&apos;s multiplayer-only and there aren&apos;t enough players. Thankfully, you won&apos;t have that problem here.</p>

This deal is for the 128GB storage configuration of the tablet, and it also includes a microSD port for expandable storage. The Fire Max 11 also boasts a good-looking 11-inch display and about 14 hours of battery life per charge, and this version comes without lockscreen ads, so you don&apos;t have to worry about that.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is Amazon's closest thing to a premium-level tablet, and Best Buy is currently selling it for $120 off as part of its back-to-school sale. With its good-looking 11-inch screen and up to 14 hours of battery life, it's a stellar tablet for most casual users. It features smooth performance, 128GB of expandable storage, and 8MP cameras, along with the option to bundle with an Amazon stylus and keyboard. The retailer is also throwing in three free months of YouTube Premium with your purchase.  </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a good deal on an already-affordable tablet; you need something with a large display; battery life is a major selling point for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a tablet with more than 128GB of storage or 4GB of RAM; you don&apos;t want to have to side-load to use Google Play Store apps.</p><p>The Fire Max 11 tablet is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">best Fire tablets</a> out there, and it&apos;s also got the best and largest screen of any of Amazon&apos;s tablets at 11 inches and a 2000x1200 resolution. This version comes with 128GB of storage, a microSD slot for up to 1TB, and around 14 hours of battery life with every charge. You can also find first-party accessories like a detachable keyboard case and a USI 2.0 stylus, though you&apos;ll need to purchase them separately.</p><p>Though it only has a MediaTek MTK8188J octa-core processor, and 4GB of RAM is pretty low, we still found performance to be pretty smooth and quick on the Fire Max 11. As a couple of other potential downsides, the screen includes a 60Hz refresh rate, which is not enough for everyone, and this tablet requires side-loading of the Play Store if you were hoping to use any Google OS apps.</p><p>To be sure, there are better tablets out there, especially if you&apos;re willing to pay more. But if you were already shopping around for one on the lower-priced end of the spectrum, this might be a good option for your needs—and an extra $120 off doesn&apos;t hurt, either.</p>

<ul><li>Google is detailing a few AI features Chrome users on desktop can expect over the next few weeks.</li><li>Such features include the debut of Google Lens in Chrome on computers, adding visual search abilities, follow-up questions, and multisearch.</li><li>Chrome on desktop also picks up "Tab Compare" when searching for multiple products and conversational AI for rediscovering your browsing history.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has developed a few new AI tools for Chrome, arriving for users today (August 1) in a big way.</p><p>In a press release, the company states that Chrome on desktop is picking up three new AI features, beginning with Google Lens on desktop. Those same capabilities we&apos;re used to on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> will hit computers via a Lens icon in the address bar. </p><p>Google states users can click the icon, which will attach a mini Lens icon to their mouse. You then "click and drag" over an area on your display to have Lens run a visual search. The search begins immediately after finishing your area highlight. Chrome will display relevant search results in a new side panel to the right.</p><p>Those on Android will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">be familiar with multisearch</a>, another feature desktop users won&apos;t miss out on. Google adds that after the initial query is run, users can click the text bar at the top of the results panel to add more. Users can refine the search by color, brand, or other details. Moreover, you can toss in a follow-up question to keep Chrome&apos;s AI going.</p>

<p>Lens in Chrome on desktop also lets you highlight text in a video to "quickly get a description in the side panel." Discovering new merchandise like backpacks or dresses is also possible by simply highlighting the object and letting the AI do its thing.</p><p>This feature will begin rolling out "over the next few days."</p><p>"Tab Compare" is another new AI-backed feature for Chrome that lets users see a quick AI-generated product comparison using <em>your </em>tabs. Google states that when users are browsing different devices (say, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speakers</a>) switching tabs is often the norm. However, Tab Compare will collect the information you have spread across those tabs and Chrome is said to "suggest" that users open this AI-generated comparison to save time.</p><p>The comparison page will display the name of each product you&apos;ve got open in your tabs alongside pricing, reviews, and other technical specs.</p><p>The "next few weeks" will bring this feature to all desktop Chrome users.</p>

<p>Chrome&apos;s final AI feature feels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">reminiscent of Gemini</a> as the company plugs in more conversational software to rediscover your history. Soon, users can ask Chrome a question about a previous site they&apos;ve visited. Chrome will then display in its address bar "Search History" with a magnifying glass and a classic Google AI star, indicating the conversational AI&apos;s presence.</p><p>From there, Chrome&apos;s drop-down menu will pull information from your browsing history to show website links that might solve your query. Google states that this feature is optional and users can enable or disable it via the settings. More importantly, those rolling in incognito mode will never have sites visited appear when using this AI search.</p><p>Chrome&apos;s AI history search will begin rolling out to U.S. users "in the coming weeks."</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus app's teardown reveals a new AI feature likely in the works.</li><li>The popular AI Summary feature on OnePlus phones might extend to OnePlus Buds.</li><li>If the feature goes live, future OnePlus Buds will be able to create call transcripts via AI.</li><li>The leaked OnePlus Buds 3 Pro could be the first to feature this tool.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is reportedly integrating a handy new AI feature into its wireless earbuds to generate call AI summaries, according to new findings from an APK teardown.</p><p>The APK teardown, done by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-buds-ai-call-summaries-apk-teardown-3466073/">Android Authority</a>, reveals a new AI call summaries feature, which can be carried out through OnePlus wireless earbuds. The findings were seen via the OnePlus Buds app bearing the <strong>14.8.2 version</strong>. The publication&apos;s screenshot of the app reveals the new AI Call Assistant toggle. Once enabled, users would need to press their compatible OnePlus Buds&apos; stem three times, which can trigger the AI summary for calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="R4T4fsZDyusL7QWzSaCvvE" name="OnePlus-Buds-app-AI-call-summari.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds app AI Summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R4T4fsZDyusL7QWzSaCvvE.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="2700" height="6000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First discovered back in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-12-receives-new-ai-features">OnePlus&apos; AI Call Summarizer</a> automatically extracts key information like instructions, addresses, names, or phone numbers from a phone call. Currently available on OnePlus phones, this will now work as a hands-free option when you take Bluetooth calls through your OnePlus Buds. </p><p>Needless to say, the said AI summarize feature will only work with compatible earbuds alongside a supported OnePlus phone that also sports an AI summary function, like the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-with-snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-goes-official">OnePlus Nord 4</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Users further have to bear in mind that if the supported OnePlus phone, for some reason, is in power-saving mode, meditation mode, or children&apos;s space mode, the AI summary mode might not work effectively. Other than that, next to the calls, AI summaries also work for online meetings made through supported third-party applications.</p><p>Lastly, as Android Authority notes, the compatible OnePlus Buds in question are likely the upcoming OnePlus Buds Pro 3. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oneplus-buds-pro-3-design-specs-revealed-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank">SmartPrix</a> leaked the Buds Pro 3 design and specs on Wednesday, suggesting they&apos;ll arrive soon as a successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>While these AI features could come to the Buds Pro 3 first, we expect these AI features to trickle down to older earbuds from the company, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a>.</p>
