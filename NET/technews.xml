<p>Have you heard of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, but haven’t tried any of them yourself? Navigating the world of large language models (LLMs) might feel a bit daunting. However, with the right approach, these tools can really enhance your teaching and make classroom admin and planning easier and quicker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s where the OCEAN prompting process comes in: it’s a straightforward framework designed to work with any LLM, helping you reliably get the results you want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great thing about the OCEAN process is that it takes the guesswork out of using LLMs. It helps you move past that ‘blank page syndrome’ — that moment when you can ask the model anything but aren’t sure where to start. By focusing on clear objectives and guiding the model with the right context, you can generate content that is spot on for your needs, every single time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 ways to make LLMs work for you using the OCEAN prompting process</h2>



<p>OCEAN’s name is an acronym: objective, context, examples, assess, negotiate — so let’s begin at the top.</p>



<p><strong>1. Define your objective</strong></p>



<p>Think of this as setting a clear goal for your interaction with the LLM. A well-defined objective ensures that the responses you get are focused and relevant.</p>



<p>Maybe you need to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Draft an email to parents about an upcoming school event</li>



<li>Create a beginner’s guide for a new Scratch project</li>



<li>Come up with engaging quiz questions for your next science lesson</li>
</ul>



<p>By knowing exactly what you want, you can give the LLM clear directions to follow, turning a broad idea into a focused task.</p>



<p><strong>2. Provide some context&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This is where you give the LLM the background information it needs to deliver the right kind of response. Think of it as setting the scene and providing some of the important information about why, and for whom, you are making the document.</p>



<p>You might include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The length of the document you need</li>



<li>Who your audience is — their age, profession, or interests</li>



<li>The tone and style you’re after, whether that’s formal, informal, or somewhere in between</li>
</ul>



<p>All of this helps the LLM include the bigger picture in its analysis and tailor its responses to suit your needs.</p>

<p><strong>3. Include examples</strong></p>



<p>By showing the LLM what you’re aiming for, you make it easier for the model to deliver the kind of output you want. This is called one-shot, few-shot, or many-shot prompting, depending on how many examples you provide.</p>



<p>You can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Include URL links&nbsp;</li>



<li>Upload documents and images (some LLMs don’t have this feature)</li>



<li>Copy and paste other text examples into your prompt</li>
</ul>



<p>Without any examples at all (zero-shot prompting), you’ll still get a response, but it might not be exactly what you had in mind. Providing examples is like giving a recipe to follow that includes pictures of the desired result, rather than just vague instructions — it helps to ensure the final product comes out the way you want it.</p>



<p><strong>4. Assess the LLM’s response</strong></p>



<p>This is where you check whether what you’ve got aligns with your original goal and meets your standards.</p>



<p>Keep an eye out for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hallucinations: incorrect information that’s presented as fact</li>



<li>Misunderstandings: did the LLM interpret your request correctly?</li>



<li>Bias: make sure the output is fair and aligned with diversity and inclusion principles</li>
</ul>



<p>A good assessment ensures that the LLM’s response is accurate and useful. Remember, LLMs don’t make decisions — they just follow instructions, so it’s up to you to guide them. This brings us neatly to the next step: negotiate the results.</p>



<p><strong>5. Negotiate the results</strong></p>



<p>If the first response isn’t quite right, don’t worry — that’s where negotiation comes in. You should give the LLM frank and clear feedback and tweak the output until it’s just right. (Don’t worry, it doesn’t have any feelings to be hurt!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you negotiate, tell the LLM if it made any mistakes, and what you did and didn’t like in the output. Tell it to ‘Add a bit at the end about …’ or ‘Stop using the word “delve” all the time!’&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to get the tone of the document just right</strong></h2>



<p>Another excellent tip is to use descriptors for the desired tone of the document in your negotiations with the LLM, such as, ‘Make that output slightly more casual.’</p>



<p>In this way, you can guide the LLM to be:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Approachable: the language will be warm and friendly, making the content welcoming and easy to understand</li>



<li>Casual: expect laid-back, informal language that feels more like a chat than a formal document</li>



<li>Concise: the response will be brief and straight to the point, cutting out any fluff and focusing on the essentials</li>



<li>Conversational: the tone will be natural and relaxed, as if you’re having a friendly conversation</li>



<li>Educational: the language will be clear and instructive, with step-by-step explanations and helpful details</li>



<li>Formal: the response will be polished and professional, using structured language and avoiding slang</li>



<li>Professional: the tone will be business-like and precise, with industry-specific terms and a focus on clarity</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember: LLMs have no idea what their output says or means; they are literally just very powerful autocomplete tools, just like those in text messaging apps. It’s up to you, the human, to make sure they are on the right track.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don’t forget the human edit&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Even after you’ve refined the LLM’s response, it’s important to do a final human edit. This is your chance to make sure everything’s perfect, checking for accuracy, clarity, and anything the LLM might have missed. LLMs are great tools, but they don’t catch everything, so your final touch ensures the content is just right.</p>



<p>At a certain point it’s also simpler and less time-consuming for you to alter individual words in the output, or use your unique expertise to massage the language for just the right tone and clarity, than going back to the LLM for a further iteration.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Evaluating Ada Computer Science</strong></h2>



<p>Ada Computer Science is a free learning platform for computer science students and teachers. It provides high-quality, online learning materials to use in the classroom, for homework, and for revision. Our experienced team has created resources that cover every topic in the leading GCSE and A level computer science specifications.</p>



<p>From May to July 2024, we invited users to provide feedback via an online survey, and we got responses from 163 students and 27 teachers. To explore the feedback further, we also conducted in-depth interviews with three computer science teachers in September 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is Ada being used?</strong></h2>



<p>The most common ways students use Ada Computer Science — as reported by more than two thirds of respondents — is for revision and/or to complete work set by their teacher. Similarly, teachers most commonly said that they direct students to use Ada outside the classroom.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“I recommend my students use Ada Computer Science as their main textbook.” — Teacher</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is users’ experience of using Ada?</strong></h2>



<p>Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that Ada is useful for learning (82%) and high quality (79%).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Ada Computer Science has been very effective for independent revision, I like how it provides hints and pointers if you answer a question incorrectly.” — Student</em></p>

<p>Ada users were generally positive about their overall experience of the platform and using it to find the information they were looking for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Ada is one of the best for hitting the nail on the head. They’ve really got it in tune with the depth that exam boards want.” — Ian Robinson, computer science teacher (St Alban&#8217;s Catholic High School, UK)</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What impact is Ada having?</strong></h2>



<p>Around half of the teachers agreed that Ada had reduced their workload and/or increased their subject knowledge. Across all respondents, teachers estimated that the average weekly time saving was <strong>1 hour 8 minutes</strong>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 81% of students agreed that as a result of using Ada, they had become better at understanding computer science concepts. Other benefits were reported too, with most students agreeing that they had become better problem-solvers, for example.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“I love Ada! It is an extremely helpful resource… The content featured is very comprehensive and detailed, and the visual guides… are particularly helpful to aid my understanding.” — Student</em></p>

<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing the stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04.png" alt="An educator sits in a library." class="wp-image-88941" style="width:660px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04.png 1500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Prabhath-04-900x506.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Prabhath, the founder of the <a href="https://stemup.lk/">STEMUP Educational Foundation</a>, began his journey into technology at an early age, influenced by his cousin, Harindra.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“He’s the one who opened up my eyes. Even though I didn’t have a laptop, he had a computer, and I used to go to their house and practise with it. That was the turning point in my life.”</p>

<div style="height:33px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This early exposure to technology, combined with support from his parents to leave his rural home in search of further education, set Prabhath on a path to address a crucial issue in Sri Lanka’s education system: the gap in opportunities for students, especially in STEM education.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“There was a gap between the kids who are studying in Sri Lanka versus the kids in other developed markets. We tried our best to see how we can bridge this gap with our own capacity, with our own strengths.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Closing the gap through STEMUP</strong></h2>



<p>Recognising the need to close this gap in opportunities, Prabhath, along with four friends who worked with him in his day job as a Partner Technology Strategist, founded the STEMUP Educational Foundation in 2016.&nbsp; STEMUP’s mission is straightforward but ambitious — it seeks to provide Sri Lankan students with equal access to STEM education, with a particular focus on those from underserved communities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05.png" alt="A group of people stands together, engaged in a lively discussion." class="wp-image-88952" style="width:658px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05.png 1500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-900x506.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></figure></div>


<p>To help close the gap, Prabhath and his team sought to establish coding clubs for students across the country. Noting the lack of infrastructure and access to resources in many parts of Sri Lanka, they partnered with Code Club at the Raspberry Pi Foundation to get things moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their initiative started small with a Code Club in the Colombo Public Library, but things quickly gained traction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What began with just a handful of friends has now grown into a movement involving over 1,500 volunteers who are all working to provide free education in coding and emerging technologies to students who otherwise wouldn’t have access.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10.png" alt="An educator helps a young person at a Code Club. " class="wp-image-88953" style="width:666px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10.png 1500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10-900x506.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></figure></div>


<p>A key reason for STEMUP’s reach has been the mobilisation of university students to serve as mentors at the Code Clubs. Prabhath believes this partnership has not only helped the success of Code Club Sri Lanka, but also given the university students themselves a chance to grow, granting them opportunities to develop the life skills needed to thrive in the workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The main challenge we see here today, when it comes to graduate students, is that they have the technology skills, but they don&#8217;t have soft skills. They don&#8217;t know how to do a presentation, how to manage a project from A to Z, right? By being a volunteer, that particular student can gain 360-degree knowledge.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Helping rural communities</strong></h2>



<p>STEMUP’s impact stretches beyond cities and into rural areas, where young people often have even fewer opportunities to engage with technology. The wish to address this imbalance&nbsp; is a big motivator for the student mentors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“When we go to rural areas, the kids don’t have much exposure to tech. They don’t know about the latest technologies. What are the new technologies for that development? And what subjects can they&nbsp; study for the future job market? So I think I can help them. So I actually want to teach someone what I know.” &#8211; <em>Kasun, Student and Code Club mentor</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This lack of access to opportunities is precisely what STEMUP aims to change, giving students a platform to explore, innovate, and connect with the wider world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coolest Projects Sri Lanka</strong></h2>



<p>STEMUP recently held the first Coolest Projects Sri Lanka, a showcase for the creations of young learners. Prabhath first encountered Coolest Projects while attending the Raspberry Pi Foundation Asia Partner summit in Malaysia.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“That was my first experience with the Coolest Projects,” says Prabhath, “and when I came back, I shared the idea with our board and fellow volunteers. They were all keen to bring it to Sri Lanka.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="488" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0240.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88965" style="width:667px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0240.png 650w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0240-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0240-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0240-450x338.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure></div>


<p>For Prabhath, the hope is that events like these will open students’ eyes to new possibilities. The first event certainly lived up to his hope. There was a lot of excitement, especially in rural areas, with multiple schools banding together and hiring buses to attend the event.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“That kind of energy… because they do not have these opportunities to showcase what they have built, connect with like minded people, and connect with the industry.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building a better future</strong></h2>



<p>Looking ahead, Prabhath sees STEMUP’s work as a vital part of shaping the future of education in Sri Lanka. By bringing technology to public libraries, engaging university students as mentors, and giving kids hands-on experience with coding and emerging technologies, STEMUP is empowering the next generation to thrive in a digital world.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“These programmes are really helpful for kids to win the future, be better citizens, and bring this country forward.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During this year’s annual <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-unescos-digital-learning-week/">Digital Learning Week conference in September</a>, UNESCO launched their AI competency frameworks for students and teachers.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1205" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88245" style="width:535px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2.jpg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2-500x377.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2-768x578.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2-800x603.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2-450x339.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco_2-900x678.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the AI competency framework for students?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000391105">UNESCO competency framework for students</a> serves as a guide for education systems across the world to help students develop the necessary skills in AI literacy and to build inclusive, just, and sustainable futures in this new technological era.</p>



<p>It is an exciting document because, as well as being comprehensive, it’s the first global framework of its kind in the area of AI education.</p>



<p><strong>The framework serves three specific purposes:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It offers a guide on essential AI concepts and skills for students, which can help shape AI education policies or programs at schools</li>



<li>It aims to shape students&#8217; values, knowledge, and skills so they can understand AI critically and ethically</li>



<li>It suggests a flexible plan for when and how students should learn about AI as they progress through different school grades</li>
</ul>



<p>The framework is a starting point for policy-makers, curriculum developers, school leaders, teachers, and educational experts to look at how it could apply in their local contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not possible to create a single curriculum suitable for all national and local contexts, but the framework flags the necessary competencies for students across the world to acquire the values, knowledge, and skills necessary to examine and understand AI critically from a holistic perspective.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does Experience AI compare with the framework?</h2>



<p>A group of researchers and curriculum developers from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, with a focus on AI literacy, attended the conference and afterwards we tasked ourselves with taking a deep dive into the student framework and mapping our Experience AI resources to it. Our aims were to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identify how the framework aligns with Experience AI</li>



<li>See how the framework aligns with our research-informed design principles</li>



<li>Identify gaps or next steps</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1280" height="842" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88243" style="width:556px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco.jpg 1280w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-500x329.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-800x526.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-450x296.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-900x592.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></figure></div>


<p>Experience AI is a free educational programme that offers cutting-edge resources on artificial intelligence and machine learning for teachers, and their students aged 11 to 14. Developed in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, the programme provides everything that teachers need to confidently deliver engaging lessons that will teach, inspire, and engage young people about AI and the role that it could play in their lives. The current curriculum offering includes a ‘Foundations of AI’ 6-lesson unit, 2 standalone lessons (‘AI and ecosystems’ and ‘Large language models’), and the 3 newly released AI safety resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working through each lesson objective in the Experience AI offering, we compared them with each curricular goal to see where they overlapped. We have made this mapping publicly available so that you can see this for yourself: <a href="https://rpf.io/unesco-mapping">Experience AI &#8211; UNESCO AI Competency framework students &#8211; learning objective mapping</a> (rpf.io/unesco-mapping)</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-12-at-13.23.10-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88927" style="width:671px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>The first thing we discovered was that the mapping of the objectives did not have a 1:1 basis. For example, when we looked at a learning objective, we often felt that it covered more than one curricular goal from the framework. That’s not to say that the learning objective fully met each curricular goal, rather that it covers elements of the goal and in turn the student competency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we had completed the mapping process, we analysed the results by totalling the number of objectives that had been mapped against each competency aspect and level within the framework.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88913" style="width:709px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>This provided us with an overall picture of where our resources are positioned against the framework. Whilst the majority of the objectives for all of the resources are in the ‘Human-centred mindset’ category, the analysis showed that there is still a relatively even spread of objectives in the other three categories (Ethics of AI, ML techniques and applications, and AI system design).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the current resource offering is targeted at the entry level to AI literacy, it is unsurprising to see that the majority of the objectives were at the level of ‘Understand’. It was, however, interesting to see how many objectives were also at the ‘Apply’ level.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88915" style="width:737px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>It is encouraging to see that the different resources from Experience AI map to different competencies in the framework. For example, the 6-lesson foundations unit aims to give students a basic understanding of how AI systems work and the data-driven approach to problem solving. In contrast, the AI safety resources focus more on the principles of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Privacy, and Security (FATPS), most of which fall more heavily under the ethics of AI and human-centred mindset categories of the competency framework.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What did we learn from the process?&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Our principles align&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We built the Experience AI resources on design principles based on the knowledge curated by Jane Waite and the Foundation’s researchers. One of our aims of the mapping process was to see if the principles that underpin the UNESCO competency framework align with our own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding anthropomorphism&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Anthropomorphism refers to the concept of attributing human characteristics to objects or living beings that aren’t human. For reasons outlined in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/">blog</a> I previously wrote on the issue, a key design principle for Experience AI is to avoid anthropomorphism at all costs. In our resources, we are particularly careful with the language and images that we use. Putting the human in the process is a key way in which we can remind students that it is humans who design and are responsible for AI systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was reassuring to see that the UNESCO framework has many curricular goals that align closely to this, for example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Foster an understanding that AI is human-led</li>



<li>Facilitate an understanding on the necessity of exercising sufficient human control over AI</li>



<li>Nurture critical thinking on the dynamic relationship between human agency and machine agency</li>
</ul>



<p>SEAME</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">SEAME framework</a> created by Paul Curzon and Jane Waite offers a way for teachers, resource developers, and researchers to talk about the focus of AI learning activities by separating them into four layers: Social and Ethical (SE), Application (A), Models (M), and Engines (E).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88918" style="width:584px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>The SEAME model and the UNESCO AI competency framework take two different approaches to categorising AI education — SEAME describes levels of abstraction for conceptual learning about AI systems, whereas the competency framework separates concepts into strands with progression. We found that although the alignment between the frameworks is not direct, the same core AI and machine learning concepts are broadly covered across both.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Computational thinking 2.0 (CT2.0)</h4>



<p>The concept of computational thinking 2.0 (a data-driven approach) stems from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/machine-learning-education-school-computational-thinking-2-0-research-seminar/">research by Professor Matti Tedre and Dr Henriikka Vartiainen</a> from the University of Eastern Finland. The essence of this approach establishes AI as a different way to solve problems using computers compared to a more traditional computational thinking approach (a rule-based approach). This does not replace the traditional computational approach, but instead requires students to approach the problem differently when using AI as a tool.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1683" height="1152" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404.jpg" alt="An educator points to an image on a student's computer screen." class="wp-image-83703" style="width:556px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404.jpg 1683w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-500x342.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-768x526.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-1536x1051.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-800x548.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-450x308.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-900x616.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1683px) 100vw, 1683px" /></figure></div>


<p>The UNESCO framework includes many references within their curricular goals that places the data-driven approach at the forefront of problem solving using AI, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Develop conceptual knowledge on how AI is trained based on data&nbsp;</li>



<li>Develop skills on assessing AI systems’ need for data, algorithms, and computing resources</li>
</ul>



<p>Where we slightly differ in our approach is the regular use of the term ‘algorithm’, particularly in the Understand and Apply levels of the framework. We have chosen to differentiate AI systems from traditional computational thinking approaches by avoiding the term ‘algorithm’ at the foundational stage of AI education. We believe the learners need a firm mental model of data-driven systems before students can understand that the Model and Engines of the SEAME model refer to algorithms (which would possibly correspond to the Create stage of the UNESCO framework).&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We can identify areas for exploration</h3>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-expands-to-reach-over-2-million-students/">international expansion of Experience AI</a>, we have been working with partners from across the globe to bring AI literacy education to students in their settings. Part of this process has involved working with our partners to localise the resources, but also to provide training on the concepts covered in Experience AI. During localisation and training, our partners often have lots of queries about the lesson on bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, we decided to see if mapping taught us anything about this lesson in particular, and if there was any learning we could take from it. At close inspection, we found that the lesson covers two out of the three curricular goals for the Understand element of the ‘Ethics of AI’ category (Embodied ethics).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88920" style="width:695px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>Specifically, we felt the lesson:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Illustrates dilemmas around AI and identifies the main reasons behind ethical conflicts</li>



<li>Facilitates scenario-based understandings of ethical principles on AI and their personal implications</li>
</ul>



<p>What we felt isn’t covered in the lesson is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Guide the embodied reflection and internalisation of ethical principles on AI</li>
</ul>



<p>Exploring this further, the framework describes this curricular goal as:</p>



<p>“<em>Guide students to understand the implications of ethical principles on AI for their human rights, data privacy, safety, human agency, as well as for equity, inclusion, social justice and environmental sustainability. Guide students to develop embodied comprehension of ethical principles; and offer opportunities to reflect on personal attitudes that can help address ethical challenges (e.g. advocating for inclusive interfaces for AI tools, promoting inclusion in AI and reporting discriminatory biases found in AI tools).</em>”</p>



<p>We realised that this doesn’t mean that the lesson on bias is ineffective or incomplete, but it does help us to think more deeply about the learning objective for the lesson. This may be something we will look to address in future iterations of the foundations unit or even in the development of new resources. What we have identified is a process that we can follow, which will help us with our decision making in the next phases of resource development.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does this inform our next steps?</h2>



<p>As part of the analysis of the resources, we created a simple heatmap of how the Experience AI objectives relate to the UNESCO progression levels. As with the barcharts, the heatmap indicated that the majority of the objectives sit within the Understand level of progression, with fewer in Apply, and fewest in Create. As previously mentioned, this is to be expected with the resources being “foundational”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The heatmap has, however, helped us to identify some interesting points about our resources that warrant further thought. For example, under the ‘Human-centred mindset’ competency aspect, there are more objectives under Apply than there are Understand. For ‘AI system design’, architecture design is the least covered aspect of Apply.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88921" style="width:686px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>By identifying these areas for investigation, again it shows that we’re able to add the learnings from the UNESCO framework to help us make decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What next?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This mapping process has been a very useful exercise in many ways for those of us working on AI literacy at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The process of mapping the resources gave us an opportunity to have deep conversations about the learning objectives and question our own understanding of our resources. It was also very satisfying to see that the framework aligns well with our own researched-informed design principles, such as the SEAME model and avoiding anthropomorphisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mapping process has been a good starting point for us to understand UNESCO’s framework and we’re sure that it will act as a useful tool to help us make decisions around future enhancements to our foundational units and new free educational materials. We’re looking forward to applying what we’ve learnt to our future work!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As computing technologies continue to rapidly evolve in today’s digital world, computing education is becoming increasingly essential. <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/arto-hellas">Arto Hellas</a> and <a href="https://juholeinonen.com/">Juho Leinonen</a>, researchers at <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en">Aalto University</a> in Finland, are exploring how innovative teaching methods can equip students with the computing skills they need to stay ahead. In particular, they are looking at how generative AI tools can enhance university-level computing education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars">monthly seminar</a> in September, Arto and Juho presented their research on using AI tools to provide personalised learning experiences and automated feedback to help requests, as well as their findings on teaching students how to write effective prompts for generative AI systems. While their research focuses primarily on undergraduate students — given that they teach such students — many of their findings have potential relevance for primary and secondary (K-12) computing education.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Generative AI consists of algorithms that can generate new content, such as text, code, and images, based on the input received. Ever since large language models (LLMs) such as <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://copilot.cloud.microsoft/?auth=2">Copilot</a> became widely available, there has been a great deal of attention on how to use this technology in computing education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arto and Juho described generative AI as one of the fastest-moving topics they had ever worked on, and explained that they were trying to see past the hype and find meaningful uses of LLMs in their computing courses. They presented three studies in which they used generative AI tools with students in ways that aimed to improve the learning experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using generative AI tools to create personalised programming exercises</h2>



<p>An important strand of computing education research investigates how to engage students by personalising programming problems based on their interests. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3632620.3671103">The first study in Arto and Juho’s research </a>&nbsp;took place within an online programming course for adult students. It involved developing a tool that used GPT-4 (the latest version of ChatGPT available at that time) to generate exercises with personalised aspects. Students could select a theme (e.g. sports, music, video games), a topic (e.g. a specific word or name), and a difficulty level for each exercise.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-500x333.jpg" alt="A student in a computing classroom." class="wp-image-81587" style="width:646px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Arto, Juho, and their students evaluated the personalised exercises that were generated. Arto and Juho used a rubric to evaluate the quality of the exercises and found that they were clear and had the themes and topics that had been requested. Students’ feedback indicated that they found the personalised exercises engaging and useful, and preferred these over randomly generated exercises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arto and Juho also evaluated the personalisation and found that exercises were often only shallowly personalised, however. In shallow personalisations, the personalised content was added in only one sentence, whereas in deep personalisations, the personalised content was present throughout the whole problem statement. It should be noted that in the examples taken from the seminar below, the terms ‘shallow’ and ‘deep’ were not being used to make a judgement on the worthiness of the topic itself, but were rather describing whether the personalisation was somewhat tokenistic or more meaningful within the exercise.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="279" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-500x279.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88840" style="width:624px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-500x279.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-300x167.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-768x428.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-800x446.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-450x251.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-900x502.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3.png 1370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="283" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-500x283.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88841" style="width:670px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-500x283.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-300x170.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-768x435.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-800x453.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-450x255.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-900x510.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4.png 1366w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>In these examples from the study, the shallow personalisation contains only one sentence to contextualise the problem, while in the deep example the whole problem statement is personalised.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The findings suggest that this personalised approach may be particularly effective on large university courses, where instructors might struggle to give one-on-one attention to every student. The findings further suggest that generative AI tools can be used to personalise educational content and help ensure that students remain engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How might all this translate to K-12 settings? Learners in primary and secondary schools often have a wide range of prior knowledge, lived experiences, and abilities. Personalised programming tasks could help diverse groups of learners engage with computing, and give educators a deeper understanding of the themes and topics that are interesting for learners.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Responding to help requests using large language models</h2>



<p>Another key aspect of Alto and Juho’s work is exploring how LLMs can be used to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3568813.3600139">generate responses to students’ requests for help</a>. They conducted a study using an online platform containing programming exercises for students. Every time a student struggled with a particular exercise, they could submit a help request, which went into a queue for a teacher to review, comment on, and return to the student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study aimed to investigate whether an LLM could effectively respond to these help requests and reduce the teachers’ workloads. An important principle was that the LLM should guide the student towards the correct answer rather than provide it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study used GPT-3.5, which was the newest version at the time. The results found that the LLM was able to analyse and detect logical and syntactical errors in code, but concerningly, the responses from the LLM also addressed some non-existent problems! This is an example of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-equal-access-ai-education/">hallucination</a>, where the LLM outputs something false that does not reflect the real data that was inputted into it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The finding that LLMs often generated both helpful and unhelpful problem-solving strategies suggests that this is not a technology to rely on in the classroom just yet. Arto and Juho intend to track the effectiveness of LLMs as newer versions are released, and explained that GPT-4 seems to detect errors more accurately, but there is no systematic analysis of this yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In primary and secondary computing classes, young learners often face similar challenges to those encountered by university students — for example, the struggle to write error-free code and debug programs. LLMs seemingly have a lot of potential to support young learners in overcoming such challenges, while also being valuable educational tools for teachers without strong computing backgrounds. Instant feedback is critical for young learners who are still developing their computational thinking skills — LLMs can provide such feedback, and could be especially useful for teachers who may lack the resources to give individualised attention to every learner. Again though, further research into <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/error-message-explanations-large-language-models-teachers-views/">LLM-based feedback systems</a> is needed before they can be implemented en-masse in classroom settings in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching students how to prompt large language models</h2>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Finally, Arto and Juho presented <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626252.3630909">a study where they introduced the idea of ‘Prompt Problems’</a>: programming exercises where students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators using a tool called Promptly. In a Prompt Problem exercise, students are presented with a visual representation of a problem that illustrates how input values will be transformed to an output. Their task is to devise a prompt (input) that will guide an LLM to generate the code (output) required to solve the problem. Prompt-generated code is evaluated automatically by the Promptly tool, helping students to refine the prompt until it produces code that solves the problem.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="302" height="392" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-88843" style="width:332px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg 302w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-193x250.jpeg 193w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The workflow of a </em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630909"><em>Prompt Problem</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Feedback from students suggested that using Prompt Problems was a good way for them to gain experience of using new programming concepts and develop their computational thinking skills. However, students were frustrated that bugs in the code had to be fixed by amending the prompt — it was not possible to edit the code directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How these findings relate to K-12 computing education is still to be explored, but they indicate that Prompt Problems with text-based programming languages could be valuable exercises for older pupils with a solid grasp of foundational programming concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Balancing the use of AI tools with fostering a sense of community</strong></h2>



<p>At the end of the presentation, Arto and Juho summarised their work and hypothesised that as society develops more and more AI tools, computing classrooms may lose some of their community aspects. They posed a very important question for all attendees to consider: “How can we foster an active community of learners in the generative AI era?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our breakout groups and the subsequent whole-group discussion, we began to think about the role of community. Some points raised highlighted the importance of working together to accurately identify and define problems, and sharing ideas about which prompts would work best to accurately solve the problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI technology continues to evolve, its role in education will likely expand. There was general agreement in the question and answer session that keeping a sense of community at the heart of computing classrooms will be important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worldwide, the use of generative AI systems and related technologies is transforming our lives. From marketing and social media to education and industry, these technologies are being used everywhere, even if it isn’t obvious. Yet, despite the growing availability and use of generative AI tools, governments are still working out how and when to regulate such technologies to ensure they don’t cause unforeseen negative consequences. </p>



<p>How, then, do we equip our young people to deal with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/">opportunities and challenges that they are faced with from generative AI applications and associated systems</a>? Teaching them <strong>about</strong> AI technologies seems an important first step. But what should we teach, when, and how?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Researching AI curriculum design</strong></h2>



<p>The researchers at the Raspberry Pi Foundation have been looking at research that will help inform curriculum design and resource development to teach about AI in school. As part of this work, a number of research themes have been established, which we would like to explore with educators at a face-to-face symposium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These research themes include the SEAME model, a simple way to analyse learning experiences about AI technology, as well as anthropomorphisation and how this might influence the formation of mental models about AI products. These research themes have become the cornerstone of the Experience AI resources we’ve co-developed with Google DeepMind. We will be using these materials to exemplify how the research themes can be used in practice as we review the recently published UNESCO AI competencies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="334" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018-500x334.jpg" alt="A group of educators at a workshop." class="wp-image-88796" style="width:674px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0018.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Most importantly, we will also review how we can help teachers and learners move from a rule-based view of problem solving to a data-driven view, from computational thinking 1.0 to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/machine-learning-education-school-computational-thinking-2-0-research-seminar/">computational thinking 2.0</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A call for teacher input on the AI curriculum</strong></h2>



<p>Over ten years ago, teachers in England experienced a large-scale change in what they needed to teach in computing lessons when programming was more formally added to the curriculum. As we enter a similar period of change — this time to introduce teaching about AI technologies — we want to hear from teachers as we collectively start to rethink our subject and curricula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We think it is imperative that educators’ voices are heard as we reimagine computer science and add data-driven technologies into an already densely packed learning context.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="info"><strong>Join our Research and Educator Community Symposium</strong></h2>



<p>On <strong>Saturday, 1 February 2025</strong>, we are running a <strong>Research and Educator Community Symposium</strong> in collaboration with the <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/">Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this symposium, we will bring together UK educators and researchers to review research themes, competency frameworks, and early international AI curricula and to reflect on how to advance approaches to teaching about AI. This will be a practical day of collaboration to produce suggested key concepts and pedagogical approaches and highlight research needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This symposium focuses on<strong> teaching about AI technologies</strong>, so we will <strong>not </strong>be looking at which AI tools might be used in general teaching and learning or how they may change teacher productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is vitally important for young people to learn how to use AI technologies in their daily lives so they can become discerning consumers of AI applications. But how should we teach them? Please help us start to consider the best approach by signing up for our Research and Educator Community Symposium by 9 December 2024.</p>

<p>We’re pleased to share <a href="http://rpf.io/ai">a new collection of Code Club projects</a> designed to introduce creators to the fascinating world of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These projects bring the latest technology to your Code Club in fun and inspiring ways, making AI and ML engaging and accessible for young people. We’d like to thank <strong>Amazon Future Engineer</strong> for supporting the development of this collection.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="263" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-500x263.png" alt="A man on a blue background, with question marks over his head, surrounded by various objects and animals, such as apples, planets, mice, a dinosaur and a shark." class="wp-image-88749" style="width:673px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-500x263.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-300x158.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-768x403.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-1536x806.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-800x420.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-900x473.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The value of learning about AI and ML</strong></h2>



<p>By engaging with AI and ML at a young age, creators gain a clearer understanding of the capabilities and limitations of these technologies, helping them to challenge misconceptions. This early exposure also builds foundational skills that are increasingly important in various fields, preparing creators for future educational and career opportunities. Additionally, as AI and ML become more integrated into educational standards, having a strong base in these concepts will make it easier for creators to grasp more advanced topics later on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s included in this collection</strong></h2>



<p>We’re excited to offer a range of AI and ML projects that feature both video tutorials and step-by-step written guides. The video tutorials are designed to guide creators through each activity at their own pace and are captioned to improve accessibility. The step-by-step written guides support creators who prefer learning through reading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The projects are crafted to be flexible and engaging. The main part of each project can be completed in just a few minutes, leaving lots of time for customisation and exploration. This setup allows for short, enjoyable sessions that can easily be incorporated into Code Club activities.</p>



<p>The collection is organised into two distinct paths, each offering a unique approach to learning about AI and ML:</p>



<p><a href="http://rpf.io/mlws"><strong>Machine learning with Scratch</strong></a> introduces foundational concepts of ML through creative and interactive projects. Creators will train models to recognise patterns and make predictions, and explore how these models can be improved with additional data.</p>



<p><a href="http://rpf.io/ai-toolkit"><strong>The AI Toolkit</strong></a> introduces various AI applications and technologies through hands-on projects using different platforms and tools. Creators will work with voice recognition, facial recognition, and other AI technologies, gaining a broad understanding of how AI can be applied in different contexts.</p>



<p>Inclusivity is a key aspect of this collection. The projects cater to various skill levels and are offered alongside an unplugged activity, ensuring that everyone can participate, regardless of available resources. Creators will also have the opportunity to stretch themselves — they can explore advanced technologies like Adobe Firefly and practical tools for managing Ollama and Stable Diffusion models on Raspberry Pi computers.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://rpf.io/tam"><strong>Teach a </strong><strong>m</strong><strong>achine</strong></a>, creators train a computer to recognise different objects such as fingers or food items. This project introduces classification in a straightforward way using the <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine</a> platform, making the concept easy to grasp.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://rpf.io/dinodecisions"><strong>Dinosaur </strong><strong>d</strong><strong>ecision </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>ree</strong></a> is an unplugged activity where creators use a paper-based branching chart to classify different types of dinosaurs. This hands-on project introduces the concept of decision-making structures, where each branch of the chart represents a choice or question leading to a different outcome. By constructing their own decision tree, creators gain a tactile understanding of how these models are used in ML to analyse data and make predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These AI projects are designed to support young people to get hands-on with AI technologies in Code Clubs and other non-formal learning environments. Creators can also enter one of their projects into <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org">Coolest Projects</a> by taking a short video showing their project and any code used to make it. Their creation will then be showcased in the online gallery for people all over the world to see.</p>

<p>Last year we <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/tswreis-coding-academy-computing-education-partnership-telangana/">launched a partnership with the Government of Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TGSWREIS) </a>in Telangana, India to develop and implement a computing curriculum at their Coding Academy School and Coding Academy College. Our impact team is conducting an evaluation. Read on to find out more about the partnership and what we’ve learned so far.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aim of the partnership&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The aim of our partnership is to enable students in the school and undergraduate college to learn about coding and computing by providing the best possible curriculum, resources, and training for teachers.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/india-school-500x333.png" alt="Students sit in a classroom and watch the lecture slides. " class="wp-image-88734" style="width:670px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/india-school-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/india-school-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/india-school-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/india-school-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/india-school-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/india-school.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>As both institutions are government institutions, education is provided for free, with&nbsp;approximately 800 high-performing students from disadvantaged backgrounds currently benefiting. The school is co-educational up to grade 10 and the college is for female undergraduate students only.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership is strategically important for us at the Raspberry Pi Foundation because it helps us to test curriculum content in an Indian context, and specifically with learners from historically marginalised communities with limited resources.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adapting our curriculum content for use in Telangana</h2>



<p>Since our partnership began, we’ve developed curriculum content for students in grades 6–12 in the school, which is in line with India’s national education policy requiring coding to be introduced from grade 6. We’ve also developed curriculum content for the undergraduate students at the college.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="367" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893-500x367.jpg" alt="Students and educators engage in digital making. " class="wp-image-88731" style="width:644px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893-500x367.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893-300x220.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893-768x564.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893-800x587.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893-450x330.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893-900x661.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/DSC00893.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>In both cases, the content was developed based on an initial needs assessment — we used the assessment to adapt content from our previous work on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum">The Computing Curriculum</a>. Local examples were integrated to make the content relatable and culturally relevant for students in Telangana. Additionally, we tailored the content for different lesson durations and to allow a higher frequency of lessons. We captured impact and learning data through assessments, lesson observations, educator interviews, student surveys, and student focus groups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Curriculum well received by educators and students</h2>



<p>We have found that the partnership is succeeding in meeting many of its objectives. The curriculum resources have received lots of positive feedback from students, educators, and observers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="282" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811-500x282.jpg" alt="Students and educators engage in digital making. " class="wp-image-88728" style="width:666px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811-500x282.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811-900x507.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4811.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>In our recent survey, 96% of school students and 85% of college students reported that they’ve learned new things in their computing classes. This was backed up by assessment marks, with students scoring an average of 70% in the school and 69% in the college for each assessment, compared to a pass mark of 40%. Students were also positive about their experiences of the computing and coding classes, and particularly enjoyed the practical components.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“My favourite thing in this computing classes [sic] is doing practical projects. By doing [things] practically we learnt a lot.” &#8211; Third year undergraduate student, Coding Academy College</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Since their last SA [summative assessment] exam, students have learnt spreadsheet [concepts] and have enjoyed applying them in activities. Their favourite part has been example codes, programming, and web-designing activities.” &#8211; Student focus group facilitator, grade 9 students, Coding Academy School</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, we also found some variation in outcomes for different groups of students and identified some improvements that are needed to ensure the content is appropriate for all. For example, educators and students felt improvements were needed to the content for undergraduates specialising in data science — there was a wish for the content to be more challenging and to more effectively prepare students for the workplace. Some amendments have been made to this content and we will continue to keep this under review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, we faced some challenges with the equipment and infrastructure available. For example, there were instances of power cuts and unstable internet connections. These issues have been addressed as far as possible with Wi-Fi dongles and educators adapting their delivery to work with the equipment available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our ambition for India</h2>



<p>Our team has already made some improvements to our curriculum content in preparation for the new academic year. We will also make further improvements based on the feedback received.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The long-term vision for our work in India is to enable any school in India to teach students about computing and creating with digital technologies. Over our five-year partnership, we plan to work with TGSWREIS to roll out a computing curriculum to other government schools within the state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our work in Telangana and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-a-computing-curriculum-in-odisha/">Odisha</a>, we are learning about the unique challenges faced by government schools. We&#8217;re designing our curriculum to address these challenges and ensure that every student in India has the opportunity to thrive in the 21st century. If you would like to know more about our work and impact in India, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:india@raspberrypi.org">india@raspberrypi.org</a>.</p>



<p>We take the evaluation of our work seriously and are always looking to understand how we can improve and increase the impact we have on the lives of young people.

<p>In 2015, Python developer Daniel Pope, who has a keen interest in education, noticed that beginners often have great ideas for creating projects but struggle because the software libraries they need to use are aimed at more confident programmers. To address this, he created <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#">Pygame Zero</a> — a simplified version of the popular PyGame software. Since then, various developers have expanded the range of &#8216;zero&#8217; libraries for Python.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Python zero libraries help beginner programmers</strong></h2>



<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has a long history of supporting Python zero libraries. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/gpio-zero-a-friendly-python-api-for-physical-computing/">GPIO Zero</a> was launched back in 2015, followed by <a href="https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/">guizero</a> and then <a href="https://picozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">picozero</a>. The goal of all &#8216;zero&#8217; libraries is the same: to help beginner programmers create amazing projects using simple, understandable code, supported by useful documentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Picamera2 library is a powerful tool for advanced users, but beginners — such as <a href="https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab">Astro Pi: Mission Space Lab</a> programme participants — would benefit from a zero library to allow them to use the Raspberry Pi Camera module.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Picamzero: how to get started</strong></h2>



<p>The Code Club Projects and Youth Programmes teams at the Raspberry Pi Foundation have joined forces to create<strong> <code>picamzero</code></strong>: a new library that makes it simple for beginners to use the Raspberry Pi Camera board.</p>



<p>As with the other &#8216;zero&#8217; libraries, it’s straightforward to get started. You can install picamzero by typing two commands in your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s terminal:</p>



<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>



<p><code>sudo apt install python3-picamzero</code></p>



<p>Once it&#8217;s installed, setting up your program to communicate with your camera is easy:</p>



<p><code>from picamzero import Camera</code></p>



<p><code>cam = Camera()</code></p>



<p>You can ask picamzero to take a time-lapse sequence and make a video of your images using a single line of code.</p>



<p><code>cam.capture_sequence("mysequence.jpg", make_video=True)</code></p>



<p>Picamzero also makes it easy to add text and image overlays to your images.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to change many areas of our lives, with new AI technologies and software having the potential to significantly impact the way programming is taught at schools. In our seminar series this year, we’ve already heard about <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/using-an-ai-code-generator-with-school-age-beginner-programmers/">new AI code generators</a> that can support and motivate young people when learning to code, AI tools that can create <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/supporting-learners-with-programming-tasks-through-ai-generated-parsons-problems/">personalised Parson’s Problems</a>, and research into <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/error-message-explanations-large-language-models-teachers-views/">how generative AI could improve young people’s understanding of program error messages</a>.</p>

<p>At times, it can seem like everything is being automated with AI. However, there are some parts of learning to program that cannot (and probably should not) be automated, such as understanding errors in code and how to fix them. Manually typing code might not be necessary in the future, but it will still be crucial to understand the code that is being generated and how to improve and develop it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As important as debugging might be for the future of programming, it’s still often the task most disliked by novice programmers. Even if program error messages can be explained in the future or tools like LitterBox can flag bugs in an engaging way, actually <strong>fixing</strong> the issues involves time, effort, and resilience — which can be hard to come by at the end of a computing lesson in the late afternoon with 30 students crammed into an IT room.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="195" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-500x195.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88651" style="width:605px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-500x195.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-300x117.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-768x299.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-800x311.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-450x175.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png 897w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Debugging can be challenging in many different ways and it is important to understand why students struggle to be able to support them better.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But what is it about debugging that young people find so hard, even when they’re given enough time to do it? And how can we make debugging a more motivating experience for young people? These are two of the questions that Laurie Gale, a PhD student at the Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre, focused on in our July seminar.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Why do students find debugging hard?</h1>



<p>Laurie has spent the past two years talking to teachers and students and developing tools (a <a href="https://github.com/LaurieGale10/program-logs-viewer">visualiser of students&#8217; programming behaviour</a> and <a href="https://primmdebug.web.app/">PRIMMDebug</a>, a teaching process and tool for debugging) to understand why many secondary school students struggle with debugging. It has quickly become clear through his research that most issues are due to problematic debugging strategies and students’ negative experiences and attitudes.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="426" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-500x426.jpeg" alt="A photograph of Laurie Gale. " class="wp-image-88652" style="width:628px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-500x426.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-294x250.jpeg 294w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-768x654.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-1536x1308.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-800x681.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-450x383.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-900x766.jpeg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image.jpeg 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>When Laurie Gale started looking into debugging research for his PhD, he noticed that the majority of studies had been with college students, so he decided to change that and find out what would make debugging easier for novice programmers at secondary school.</em><br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When students first start learning how to program, they have to remember a vast amount of new information, such as different variables, concepts, and program designs. Utilising this knowledge is often challenging because they’re already busy juggling all the content they’ve previously learnt and the challenges of the programming task at hand. When error messages inevitably appear that are confusing or misunderstood, it can become extremely difficult to debug effectively.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="156" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-500x156.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88653" style="width:630px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-500x156.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-300x94.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-768x240.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-800x250.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-450x141.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-900x281.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png 1422w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Program error messages are usually not tailored to the age of the programmers and can be hard to understand and overwhelming for novices.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Given this information overload, students often don’t develop efficient strategies for debugging. When Laurie analysed the debugging efforts of 12- to 14-year-old secondary school students, he noticed some interesting differences between students who were more and less successful at debugging. While successful students generally seemed to make less frequent and more intentional changes, less successful students tinkered frequently with their broken programs, making one- or two-character edits before running the program again. In addition, the less successful students often ran the program soon after beginning the debugging exercise without allowing enough time to actually read the code and understand what it was meant to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issue with these behaviours was that they often resulted in students <strong>adding errors</strong> when changing the program, which then compounded and made debugging increasingly difficult with each run. 74% of students also resorted to spamming, pressing ‘run’ again and again without changing anything. This strategy resonated with many of our seminar attendees, who reported doing the same thing after becoming frustrated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Educators need to be aware of the negative consequences of students’ exasperating and often overwhelming experiences with debugging, especially if students are less confident in their programming skills to begin with. Even though spending 15 minutes on an exercise shows a remarkable level of tenaciousness and resilience, students’ attitudes to programming — and computing as a whole — can quickly go downhill if their strategies for identifying errors prove ineffective. Debugging becomes a vicious circle: if a student has negative experiences, they are less confident when having to bug-fix again in the future, which can lead to another set of unsuccessful attempts, which can further damage their confidence, and so on. Avoiding this downward spiral is essential.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Approaches to help students engage with debugging</h1>



<p>Laurie stresses the importance of understanding the cognitive challenges of debugging and using the right tools and techniques to empower students and support them in developing effective strategies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="282" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-500x282.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88654" style="width:594px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-768x434.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-800x452.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-450x254.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-900x508.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png 1071w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>To make debugging a less cognitively demanding activity, Laurie recommends using a range of tools and strategies in the classroom.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Some ideas of how to improve debugging skills that were mentioned by Laurie and our attendees included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Using frame-based editing tools for novice programmers</strong> because such tools encourage students to focus on logical errors rather than accidental syntax errors, which can distract them from understanding the issues with the program. Teaching debugging should also go hand in hand with understanding programming syntax and using simple language. As one of our attendees put it, “You wouldn’t give novice readers a huge essay and ask them to find errors.”</li>



<li><strong>Making error messages more understandable</strong>, for example, by <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/error-message-explanations-large-language-models-teachers-views/">explaining them to students using Large Language Models</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Teaching systematic debugging processes</strong>. There are several different approaches to doing this. One of our participants suggested using the scientific method (forming a hypothesis about what is going wrong, devising an experiment that will provide information to see whether the hypothesis is right, and iterating this process) to methodically understand the program and its bugs. </li>
</ul>



<p>Most importantly, debugging should not be a daunting or stressful experience. Everyone in the seminar agreed that creating a positive error culture is essential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some ideas you could explore in your classroom include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Normalising errors</strong>: Stress how normal and important program errors are. Everyone encounters them — a professional software developer in our audience said that they spend about half of their time debugging. </li>



<li><strong>Rewarding perseverance</strong>: Celebrate the effort, not just the outcome.</li>



<li><strong>Modelling how to fix errors</strong>: Let your students write buggy programs and attempt to debug them in front of the class.</li>
</ul>



<p>In a welcoming classroom where students are given support and encouragement, debugging can be a rewarding experience. What may at first appear to be a failure — even a spectacular one — can be embraced as a valuable opportunity for learning. As a teacher in Laurie’s study said, “If something should have gone right and went badly wrong but somebody found something interesting on the way… you celebrate it. Take the fear out of it.”&nbsp;</p>
