<p>We are excited to share our report on the impact of the 2023/24 Astro Pi Challenge. Earlier this year we conducted surveys and focus groups with mentors who took part in the Astro Pi Challenge, to understand the value and impact the challenge offers to young people and mentors. You can read the full report <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/astro-pi/AstroPi_Impact_Report_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, but here are the highlights.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the Astro Pi Challenge?</h2>



<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It offers young people the amazing opportunity to learn how to code and conduct scientific investigations in space, by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers on board the International Space Station (ISS). The annual Astro Pi Challenge is open to young people up to age 19 in ESA member and associate countries.</p>



<p>Each year, there are two missions: Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Five reasons to take part in the Astro Pi Challenge</h2>



<p>Based on the findings in this report, we wanted to highlight five great reasons to take part in the Astro Pi Challenge, and direct you to some resources to help you get started — there is still plenty of time to enter the 2024/25 challenge!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Young people get to run their code in space</h3>



<p>Mentors told us how excited young people were to be working on something that connected with the real world, and how proud they were that their code ran on the International Space Station.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Participating in Mission Space Labs offers students a great opportunity to work with the International Space Station, to see the Earth from above, to challenge them to overcome the terrestrial limits.&#8221; – Mission Space Lab mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Young people are inspired to continue to learn</h3>



<p>91% of mentors told us that young people who successfully wrote code for Mission Space Lab were likely or very likely to participate in computing and digital making challenges in the future.</p>



<p>Mission Zero mentors shared that young people who saw others take part in the mission were inspired to get involved.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Young people learn new skills</h3>



<p>Mission Space Lab mentors told us that young people who successfully wrote code for Mission Space Lab had a greater understanding of STEM concepts, and increased their skills and confidence in computing and digital making.</p>



<p>Mentors also said that Mission Zero provides a great first step into using Python.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I think it was very good at setting up the first bit of Python and just having a very limited command set and a very quick result…&#8221; – Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Astro Pi mentors have fun</h3>



<p>It’s not just the young people that enjoy Astro Pi — 95% of Mission Space Lab mentors and 99% of Mission Zero mentors said they somewhat or very much enjoyed taking part.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. We provide the resources and support Astro Pi mentors need</h3>



<p>Mentors gave us positive feedback on the guidance we provided to help them support young people. This year, we have produced even more resources and ways to support mentors to lead missions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The Mission [Space] Lab guide was fantastic for my students; step by step&#8221; – Mission Space Lab mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to get involved</h2>

<p>AI, machine learning (ML), and data science infuse our daily lives, from the recommendation functionality on music apps to technologies that influence our healthcare, transport, education, defence, and more.</p>



<p>What jobs will be affected by AL, ML, and data science remains to be seen, but it is increasingly clear that students will need to learn something about these topics. There will be new concepts to be taught, new instructional approaches and assessment techniques to be used, new learning activities to be delivered, and we must not neglect the professional development required to help educators master all of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As AI and data science are incorporated into school curricula and teaching and learning materials worldwide, we ask: What’s the research basis for these curricula, pedagogy, and resource choices?</p>



<p>In 2024, we showcased researchers who are investigating how AI can be leveraged to support the teaching and learning of programming. But in 2025, we look at <strong>what</strong> should be taught <strong>about</strong> AI, ML, and data science in schools and<strong> how</strong> we should teach this.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Our 2025 seminar speakers — so far!</strong></h2>



<p>We are very excited that we have already secured several key researchers in the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On 21 January, <strong>Shuchi Grover</strong> will kick off the seminar series by giving an important overview of AI in the K–12 landscape, including developing both AI literacy and AI ethics. Shuchi will provide concrete examples and recently developed frameworks to give educators practical insights on the topic.</p>



<p>Our second session will focus on a teacher professional development (PD) programme to support the introduction of AI in Upper Bavarian schools. <strong>Franz </strong><strong>Jetzinger</strong> from the Technical University of Munich will summarise the PD programme and share how teachers implemented the topic in their classroom, including the difficulties they encountered.</p>



<p>Again from Germany, <strong>Lukas Höper </strong>from Paderborn University, with <strong>Carsten Schulte</strong> will describe important research on data awareness and introduce a framework that is likely to be key for learning about data-driven technology. The pair will talk about the Data Awareness Framework and how it has been used to help learners explore, evaluate, and be empowered in looking at the role of data in everyday applications. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Our April seminar will see <strong>David Weintrop</strong> from the University of Maryland introduce, with his colleagues, a data science curriculum called API Can Code, aimed at high-school students. The group will highlight the strategies needed for integrating data science learning within students’ lived experiences and fostering authentic engagement.</p>



<p>Later in the year, <strong>Jesús Moreno-Leon</strong> from the University of Seville will help us consider the&nbsp; thorny but essential question of how we measure AI literacy. Jesús will present an assessment instrument that has been successfully implemented in several research studies involving thousands of primary and secondary education students across Spain, discussing both its strengths and limitations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What to expect from the seminars</strong></h2>



<p>Our seminars are designed to be accessible to anyone interested in the latest research about AI education — whether you’re a teacher, educator, researcher, or simply curious. Each session begins with a presentation from our guest speaker about their latest research findings. We then move into small groups for a short discussion and exchange of ideas before coming back together for a Q&amp;A session with the presenter.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="513" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3.jpg" alt="An educator is helping two young learners with a coding task." class="wp-image-89074" style="width:658px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3.jpg 720w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3-500x356.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3-450x321.jpg 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>


<p>Attendees of our 2024 series told us that they valued that the talks “explore a relevant topic in an informative way“, the “enthusiasm and inspiration”, and particularly the small-group discussions because they “are always filled with interesting and varied ideas and help to spark my own thoughts”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seminars usually take place on Zoom on the first Tuesday of each month at 17:00–18:30 GMT / 12:00–13:30 ET / 9:00–10:30 PT / 18:00–19:30 CET.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find out more about each seminar and the speakers on our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars">upcoming seminar page</a>. And if you are unable to attend one of our talks, you can watch them from our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous">previous seminar page</a>, where you will also find an archive of all of our previous seminars dating back to 2020.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to sign up</strong></h2>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, and education is no exception. AI-driven development environments (AIDEs), like GitHub Copilot, are opening up new possibilities, and educators and researchers are keen to understand how these tools impact students learning to code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our 50th research seminar, <strong>Nicholas Gardella</strong>, a PhD candidate at the University of Virginia, shared insights from his research on the effects of AIDEs on beginner programmers’ skills.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Measuring AI’s impact on students</strong></h2>



<p>AI tools are becoming a big part of software development, but what does that mean for students learning to code? As tools like GitHub Copilot become more common, it’s crucial to ask: Do these tools help students to learn better and work more effectively, especially when time is tight?</p>



<p>This is precisely what Nicholas’s research aims to identify by examining the impact of AIDEs on four key areas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Performance (how well students completed the tasks)</li>



<li>Workload (the effort required)</li>



<li>Emotion (their emotional state during the task)</li>



<li>Self-efficacy (their belief in their own abilities to succeed)</li>
</ul>



<p>Nicholas conducted his study with 17 undergraduate students from an introductory computer science course, who were mostly first-time programmers, with different genders and backgrounds.</p>

<p>The students completed programming tasks both with and without the assistance of GitHub Copilot. Nicholas selected the tasks from OpenAI&#8217;s human evaluation data set, ensuring they represented a range of difficulty levels. He also used a repeated measures design for the study, meaning that each student had the opportunity to program both independently and with AI assistance multiple times. This design helped him to compare individual progress and attitudes towards using AI in programming.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Less workload, more performance and self-efficacy in learning</strong></h2>



<p>The results were promising for those advocating AI’s role in education. Nicholas’s research found that participants who used GitHub Copilot performed better overall, completing tasks with less mental workload and effort compared to solo programming.</p>

<p>However, the immediate impact on students’ emotional state and self-confidence was less pronounced. Initially, participants did not report feeling more confident while coding with AI. Over time, though, as they became more familiar with the tool, their confidence in their abilities improved slightly. This indicates that students need time and practice to fully integrate AI into their learning process. Students increasingly attributed their progress not to the AI doing the work for them, but to their own growing proficiency in using the tool effectively. This suggests that with sustained practice, students can gain confidence in their abilities to work with AI, rather than becoming overly reliant on it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="271" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024-500x271.png" alt="Graphic depicting Nicholas' RQ1 results." class="wp-image-89033" style="width:500px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024-500x271.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024-300x162.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024-768x416.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024-800x433.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024-450x244.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024-900x487.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/RQ2-Results-November-Research-Seminar-2024.png 1326w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Students who used AI tools seemed to improve more quickly than students who worked on the exercises themselves.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A particularly important takeaway from the talk was the reduction in workload when using AI tools. Novice programmers, who often find programming challenging, reported that AI assistance lightened the workload. This reduced effort could create a more relaxed learning environment, where students feel less overwhelmed and more capable of tackling challenging tasks.</p>



<p>However, while workload decreased, use of the AI tool did not significantly boost emotional satisfaction or happiness during the coding process. Nicholas explained that although students worked more efficiently, using the AI tool did not necessarily make coding a more enjoyable experience. This highlights a key challenge for educators: finding ways to make learning both effective and engaging, even when using advanced tools like AI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI as a tool for collaboration, not replacement</strong></h2>



<p>Nicholas’s findings raise interesting questions about how AI should be introduced in computer science education. While tools like GitHub Copilot can enhance performance, they should not be seen as shortcuts for learning. Students still need guidance in how to use these tools responsibly. Importantly, the study showed that students did not take credit for the AI tool’s work — instead, they felt responsible for their own progress, especially as they improved their interactions with the tool over time.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Students might become better programmers when they learn how to work alongside AI systems, using them to enhance their problem-solving skills rather than relying on them for answers. This suggests that educators should focus on teaching students how to collaborate with AI, rather than fearing that these tools will undermine the learning process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bridging research and classroom realities</strong></h2>



<p>Moreover, the study touched on an important point about the limits of its findings. Since the experiment was conducted in a controlled environment with only 17 participants, researchers need to conduct further studies to explore how AI tools perform in real-world classroom settings. For example, the role of internet usage plays a fundamental role. It will be relevant to understand how factors such as class size, prior varying experience, and the age of students affect their ability to integrate AI into their learning.</p>



<p>In the follow-up discussion, Nicholas also demonstrated how AI tools are becoming more accessible within browsers and how teachers can integrate AI-driven development environments more easily into their courses. By making AI technology more readily available, these tools are democratising access to advanced programming aids, enabling students to build applications directly in their web browsers with minimal setup.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The path ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Nicholas’s talk provided an insightful look into the evolving relationship between AI tools and novice programmers. While AI can improve performance and reduce workload, it is not a magic solution to all the challenges of learning to code.</p>



<p>Based on the discussion after the talk, educators should support students in developing the skills to use these tools effectively, shaping an environment where they can feel confident working with AI systems. The researchers and educators agreed that more research is needed to expand on these findings, particularly in more diverse and larger-scale educational settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI continues to shape the future of programming education, the role of educators will remain crucial in guiding students towards responsible and effective use of these technologies, as we are only at the beginning.</p>

<p>Have you heard of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, but haven’t tried any of them yourself? Navigating the world of large language models (LLMs) might feel a bit daunting. However, with the right approach, these tools can really enhance your teaching and make classroom admin and planning easier and quicker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s where the OCEAN prompting process comes in: it’s a straightforward framework designed to work with any LLM, helping you reliably get the results you want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great thing about the OCEAN process is that it takes the guesswork out of using LLMs. It helps you move past that ‘blank page syndrome’ — that moment when you can ask the model anything but aren’t sure where to start. By focusing on clear objectives and guiding the model with the right context, you can generate content that is spot on for your needs, every single time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 ways to make LLMs work for you using the OCEAN prompting process</h2>



<p>OCEAN’s name is an acronym: objective, context, examples, assess, negotiate — so let’s begin at the top.</p>



<p><strong>1. Define your objective</strong></p>



<p>Think of this as setting a clear goal for your interaction with the LLM. A well-defined objective ensures that the responses you get are focused and relevant.</p>



<p>Maybe you need to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Draft an email to parents about an upcoming school event</li>



<li>Create a beginner’s guide for a new Scratch project</li>



<li>Come up with engaging quiz questions for your next science lesson</li>
</ul>



<p>By knowing exactly what you want, you can give the LLM clear directions to follow, turning a broad idea into a focused task.</p>



<p><strong>2. Provide some context&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This is where you give the LLM the background information it needs to deliver the right kind of response. Think of it as setting the scene and providing some of the important information about why, and for whom, you are making the document.</p>



<p>You might include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The length of the document you need</li>



<li>Who your audience is — their age, profession, or interests</li>



<li>The tone and style you’re after, whether that’s formal, informal, or somewhere in between</li>
</ul>



<p>All of this helps the LLM include the bigger picture in its analysis and tailor its responses to suit your needs.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1066" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-89009" style="width:656px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/unnamed-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/uk/images/business-organization-achievement-from-chaos-to-order/232628568?prev_url=detail">Andril Zastrozhnov</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>3. Include examples</strong></p>



<p>By showing the LLM what you’re aiming for, you make it easier for the model to deliver the kind of output you want. This is called one-shot, few-shot, or many-shot prompting, depending on how many examples you provide.</p>



<p>You can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Include URL links&nbsp;</li>



<li>Upload documents and images (some LLMs don’t have this feature)</li>



<li>Copy and paste other text examples into your prompt</li>
</ul>



<p>Without any examples at all (zero-shot prompting), you’ll still get a response, but it might not be exactly what you had in mind. Providing examples is like giving a recipe to follow that includes pictures of the desired result, rather than just vague instructions — it helps to ensure the final product comes out the way you want it.</p>



<p><strong>4. Assess the LLM’s response</strong></p>



<p>This is where you check whether what you’ve got aligns with your original goal and meets your standards.</p>



<p>Keep an eye out for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hallucinations: incorrect information that’s presented as fact</li>



<li>Misunderstandings: did the LLM interpret your request correctly?</li>



<li>Bias: make sure the output is fair and aligned with diversity and inclusion principles</li>
</ul>



<p>A good assessment ensures that the LLM’s response is accurate and useful. Remember, LLMs don’t make decisions — they just follow instructions, so it’s up to you to guide them. This brings us neatly to the next step: negotiate the results.</p>



<p><strong>5. Negotiate the results</strong></p>



<p>If the first response isn’t quite right, don’t worry — that’s where negotiation comes in. You should give the LLM frank and clear feedback and tweak the output until it’s just right. (Don’t worry, it doesn’t have any feelings to be hurt!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you negotiate, tell the LLM if it made any mistakes, and what you did and didn’t like in the output. Tell it to ‘Add a bit at the end about …’ or ‘Stop using the word “delve” all the time!’&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to get the tone of the document just right</strong></h2>



<p>Another excellent tip is to use descriptors for the desired tone of the document in your negotiations with the LLM, such as, ‘Make that output slightly more casual.’</p>



<p>In this way, you can guide the LLM to be:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Approachable: the language will be warm and friendly, making the content welcoming and easy to understand</li>



<li>Casual: expect laid-back, informal language that feels more like a chat than a formal document</li>



<li>Concise: the response will be brief and straight to the point, cutting out any fluff and focusing on the essentials</li>



<li>Conversational: the tone will be natural and relaxed, as if you’re having a friendly conversation</li>



<li>Educational: the language will be clear and instructive, with step-by-step explanations and helpful details</li>



<li>Formal: the response will be polished and professional, using structured language and avoiding slang</li>



<li>Professional: the tone will be business-like and precise, with industry-specific terms and a focus on clarity</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember: LLMs have no idea what their output says or means; they are literally just very powerful autocomplete tools, just like those in text messaging apps. It’s up to you, the human, to make sure they are on the right track.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don’t forget the human edit&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Even after you’ve refined the LLM’s response, it’s important to do a final human edit. This is your chance to make sure everything’s perfect, checking for accuracy, clarity, and anything the LLM might have missed. LLMs are great tools, but they don’t catch everything, so your final touch ensures the content is just right.</p>



<p>At a certain point it’s also simpler and less time-consuming for you to alter individual words in the output, or use your unique expertise to massage the language for just the right tone and clarity, than going back to the LLM for a further iteration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s been over a year since we launched Ada Computer Science, and we continue to see the numbers of students and teachers using the platform all around the world grow. Our recent <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ada-computer-science-a-year-in-review/">year in review</a> shared some of the key developments we’ve made since launching, many of which are a direct result of feedback from our community.</p>



<p>Today, we are publishing an <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/Ada-CS/Ada_Impact_Report_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact report</a> that includes some of this feedback, along with what users are saying about the impact Ada Computer Science is having.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Evaluating Ada Computer Science</strong></h2>



<p>Ada Computer Science is a free learning platform for computer science students and teachers. It provides high-quality, online learning materials to use in the classroom, for homework, and for revision. Our experienced team has created resources that cover every topic in the leading GCSE and A level computer science specifications.</p>



<p>From May to July 2024, we invited users to provide feedback via an online survey, and we got responses from 163 students and 27 teachers. To explore the feedback further, we also conducted in-depth interviews with three computer science teachers in September 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is Ada being used?</strong></h2>



<p>The most common ways students use Ada Computer Science — as reported by more than two thirds of respondents — is for revision and/or to complete work set by their teacher. Similarly, teachers most commonly said that they direct students to use Ada outside the classroom.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“I recommend my students use Ada Computer Science as their main textbook.” — Teacher</em></p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1578" height="976" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88818" style="width:531px;height:auto" title="Chart" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image.png 1578w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-300x186.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-500x309.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-768x475.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-1536x950.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-800x495.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-450x278.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-900x557.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1578px) 100vw, 1578px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is users’ experience of using Ada?</strong></h2>



<p>Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that Ada is useful for learning (82%) and high quality (79%).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Ada Computer Science has been very effective for independent revision, I like how it provides hints and pointers if you answer a question incorrectly.” — Student</em></p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Ada users were generally positive about their overall experience of the platform and using it to find the information they were looking for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Ada is one of the best for hitting the nail on the head. They’ve really got it in tune with the depth that exam boards want.” — Ian Robinson, computer science teacher (St Alban&#8217;s Catholic High School, UK)</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What impact is Ada having?</strong></h2>



<p>Around half of the teachers agreed that Ada had reduced their workload and/or increased their subject knowledge. Across all respondents, teachers estimated that the average weekly time saving was <strong>1 hour 8 minutes</strong>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 81% of students agreed that as a result of using Ada, they had become better at understanding computer science concepts. Other benefits were reported too, with most students agreeing that they had become better problem-solvers, for example.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“I love Ada! It is an extremely helpful resource… The content featured is very comprehensive and detailed, and the visual guides… are particularly helpful to aid my understanding.” — Student</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future developments</strong></h2>



<p>Since receiving this feedback, we have already released updated site navigation and new question finder designs. In 2025, we are planning improvements to the markbook (for example, giving teachers an overview of the assignments they’ve set) and to how assignments can be created.</p>

<p>Prabhath, the founder of the <a href="https://stemup.lk/">STEMUP Educational Foundation</a>, began his journey into technology at an early age, influenced by his cousin, Harindra.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“He’s the one who opened up my eyes. Even though I didn’t have a laptop, he had a computer, and I used to go to their house and practise with it. That was the turning point in my life.”</p>

<div style="height:33px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This early exposure to technology, combined with support from his parents to leave his rural home in search of further education, set Prabhath on a path to address a crucial issue in Sri Lanka’s education system: the gap in opportunities for students, especially in STEM education.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“There was a gap between the kids who are studying in Sri Lanka versus the kids in other developed markets. We tried our best to see how we can bridge this gap with our own capacity, with our own strengths.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Closing the gap through STEMUP</strong></h2>



<p>Recognising the need to close this gap in opportunities, Prabhath, along with four friends who worked with him in his day job as a Partner Technology Strategist, founded the STEMUP Educational Foundation in 2016.&nbsp; STEMUP’s mission is straightforward but ambitious — it seeks to provide Sri Lankan students with equal access to STEM education, with a particular focus on those from underserved communities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05.png" alt="A group of people stands together, engaged in a lively discussion." class="wp-image-88952" style="width:658px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05.png 1500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-05-900x506.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></figure></div>


<p>To help close the gap, Prabhath and his team sought to establish coding clubs for students across the country. Noting the lack of infrastructure and access to resources in many parts of Sri Lanka, they partnered with Code Club at the Raspberry Pi Foundation to get things moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their initiative started small with a Code Club in the Colombo Public Library, but things quickly gained traction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What began with just a handful of friends has now grown into a movement involving over 1,500 volunteers who are all working to provide free education in coding and emerging technologies to students who otherwise wouldn’t have access.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Shot-10.png" alt="An educator helps a young person at a Code Club.

<p>A key reason for STEMUP’s reach has been the mobilisation of university students to serve as mentors at the Code Clubs. Prabhath believes this partnership has not only helped the success of Code Club Sri Lanka, but also given the university students themselves a chance to grow, granting them opportunities to develop the life skills needed to thrive in the workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The main challenge we see here today, when it comes to graduate students, is that they have the technology skills, but they don&#8217;t have soft skills. They don&#8217;t know how to do a presentation, how to manage a project from A to Z, right? By being a volunteer, that particular student can gain 360-degree knowledge.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Helping rural communities</strong></h2>



<p>STEMUP’s impact stretches beyond cities and into rural areas, where young people often have even fewer opportunities to engage with technology. The wish to address this imbalance&nbsp; is a big motivator for the student mentors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“When we go to rural areas, the kids don’t have much exposure to tech. They don’t know about the latest technologies. What are the new technologies for that development? And what subjects can they&nbsp; study for the future job market? So I think I can help them. So I actually want to teach someone what I know.” &#8211; <em>Kasun, Student and Code Club mentor</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This lack of access to opportunities is precisely what STEMUP aims to change, giving students a platform to explore, innovate, and connect with the wider world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coolest Projects Sri Lanka</strong></h2>



<p>STEMUP recently held the first Coolest Projects Sri Lanka, a showcase for the creations of young learners. Prabhath first encountered Coolest Projects while attending the Raspberry Pi Foundation Asia Partner summit in Malaysia.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“That was my first experience with the Coolest Projects,” says Prabhath, “and when I came back, I shared the idea with our board and fellow volunteers. They were all keen to bring it to Sri Lanka.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Prabhath, the hope is that events like these will open students’ eyes to new possibilities. The first event certainly lived up to his hope. There was a lot of excitement, especially in rural areas, with multiple schools banding together and hiring buses to attend the event.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building a better future</strong></h2>



<p>Looking ahead, Prabhath sees STEMUP’s work as a vital part of shaping the future of education in Sri Lanka. By bringing technology to public libraries, engaging university students as mentors, and giving kids hands-on experience with coding and emerging technologies, STEMUP is empowering the next generation to thrive in a digital world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this year’s annual <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-unescos-digital-learning-week/">Digital Learning Week conference in September</a>, UNESCO launched their AI competency frameworks for students and teachers.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the AI competency framework for students?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000391105">UNESCO competency framework for students</a> serves as a guide for education systems across the world to help students develop the necessary skills in AI literacy and to build inclusive, just, and sustainable futures in this new technological era.</p>



<p>It is an exciting document because, as well as being comprehensive, it’s the first global framework of its kind in the area of AI education.</p>



<p><strong>The framework serves three specific purposes:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It offers a guide on essential AI concepts and skills for students, which can help shape AI education policies or programs at schools</li>



<li>It aims to shape students&#8217; values, knowledge, and skills so they can understand AI critically and ethically</li>



<li>It suggests a flexible plan for when and how students should learn about AI as they progress through different school grades</li>
</ul>



<p>The framework is a starting point for policy-makers, curriculum developers, school leaders, teachers, and educational experts to look at how it could apply in their local contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not possible to create a single curriculum suitable for all national and local contexts, but the framework flags the necessary competencies for students across the world to acquire the values, knowledge, and skills necessary to examine and understand AI critically from a holistic perspective.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does Experience AI compare with the framework?</h2>



<p>A group of researchers and curriculum developers from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, with a focus on AI literacy, attended the conference and afterwards we tasked ourselves with taking a deep dive into the student framework and mapping our Experience AI resources to it. Our aims were to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identify how the framework aligns with Experience AI</li>



<li>See how the framework aligns with our research-informed design principles</li>



<li>Identify gaps or next steps</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1280" height="842" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88243" style="width:556px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco.jpg 1280w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-500x329.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-800x526.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-450x296.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/unesco-900x592.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></figure></div>


<p>Experience AI is a free educational programme that offers cutting-edge resources on artificial intelligence and machine learning for teachers, and their students aged 11 to 14. Developed in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, the programme provides everything that teachers need to confidently deliver engaging lessons that will teach, inspire, and engage young people about AI and the role that it could play in their lives. The current curriculum offering includes a ‘Foundations of AI’ 6-lesson unit, 2 standalone lessons (‘AI and ecosystems’ and ‘Large language models’), and the 3 newly released AI safety resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working through each lesson objective in the Experience AI offering, we compared them with each curricular goal to see where they overlapped. We have made this mapping publicly available so that you can see this for yourself: <a href="https://rpf.io/unesco-mapping">Experience AI &#8211; UNESCO AI Competency framework students &#8211; learning objective mapping</a> (rpf.io/unesco-mapping)</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-12-at-13.23.10-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88927" style="width:671px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>The first thing we discovered was that the mapping of the objectives did not have a 1:1 basis. For example, when we looked at a learning objective, we often felt that it covered more than one curricular goal from the framework. That’s not to say that the learning objective fully met each curricular goal, rather that it covers elements of the goal and in turn the student competency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we had completed the mapping process, we analysed the results by totalling the number of objectives that had been mapped against each competency aspect and level within the framework.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88913" style="width:709px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>This provided us with an overall picture of where our resources are positioned against the framework. Whilst the majority of the objectives for all of the resources are in the ‘Human-centred mindset’ category, the analysis showed that there is still a relatively even spread of objectives in the other three categories (Ethics of AI, ML techniques and applications, and AI system design).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the current resource offering is targeted at the entry level to AI literacy, it is unsurprising to see that the majority of the objectives were at the level of ‘Understand’. It was, however, interesting to see how many objectives were also at the ‘Apply’ level.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88915" style="width:737px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>It is encouraging to see that the different resources from Experience AI map to different competencies in the framework. For example, the 6-lesson foundations unit aims to give students a basic understanding of how AI systems work and the data-driven approach to problem solving. In contrast, the AI safety resources focus more on the principles of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Privacy, and Security (FATPS), most of which fall more heavily under the ethics of AI and human-centred mindset categories of the competency framework.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What did we learn from the process?&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Our principles align&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We built the Experience AI resources on design principles based on the knowledge curated by Jane Waite and the Foundation’s researchers. One of our aims of the mapping process was to see if the principles that underpin the UNESCO competency framework align with our own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding anthropomorphism&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Anthropomorphism refers to the concept of attributing human characteristics to objects or living beings that aren’t human. For reasons outlined in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/">blog</a> I previously wrote on the issue, a key design principle for Experience AI is to avoid anthropomorphism at all costs. In our resources, we are particularly careful with the language and images that we use. Putting the human in the process is a key way in which we can remind students that it is humans who design and are responsible for AI systems.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1920" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-scaled.jpg" alt="Young people use computers in a classroom. " class="wp-image-88353" style="width:542px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/group-at-computer-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>It was reassuring to see that the UNESCO framework has many curricular goals that align closely to this, for example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Foster an understanding that AI is human-led</li>



<li>Facilitate an understanding on the necessity of exercising sufficient human control over AI</li>



<li>Nurture critical thinking on the dynamic relationship between human agency and machine agency</li>
</ul>



<p>SEAME</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">SEAME framework</a> created by Paul Curzon and Jane Waite offers a way for teachers, resource developers, and researchers to talk about the focus of AI learning activities by separating them into four layers: Social and Ethical (SE), Application (A), Models (M), and Engines (E).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88918" style="width:584px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>The SEAME model and the UNESCO AI competency framework take two different approaches to categorising AI education — SEAME describes levels of abstraction for conceptual learning about AI systems, whereas the competency framework separates concepts into strands with progression. We found that although the alignment between the frameworks is not direct, the same core AI and machine learning concepts are broadly covered across both.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Computational thinking 2.0 (CT2.0)</h4>



<p>The concept of computational thinking 2.0 (a data-driven approach) stems from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/machine-learning-education-school-computational-thinking-2-0-research-seminar/">research by Professor Matti Tedre and Dr Henriikka Vartiainen</a> from the University of Eastern Finland. The essence of this approach establishes AI as a different way to solve problems using computers compared to a more traditional computational thinking approach (a rule-based approach). This does not replace the traditional computational approach, but instead requires students to approach the problem differently when using AI as a tool.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1683" height="1152" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404.jpg" alt="An educator points to an image on a student's computer screen." class="wp-image-83703" style="width:556px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404.jpg 1683w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-500x342.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-768x526.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-1536x1051.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-800x548.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-450x308.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-900x616.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1683px) 100vw, 1683px" /></figure></div>


<p>The UNESCO framework includes many references within their curricular goals that places the data-driven approach at the forefront of problem solving using AI, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Develop conceptual knowledge on how AI is trained based on data&nbsp;</li>



<li>Develop skills on assessing AI systems’ need for data, algorithms, and computing resources</li>
</ul>



<p>Where we slightly differ in our approach is the regular use of the term ‘algorithm’, particularly in the Understand and Apply levels of the framework. We have chosen to differentiate AI systems from traditional computational thinking approaches by avoiding the term ‘algorithm’ at the foundational stage of AI education. We believe the learners need a firm mental model of data-driven systems before students can understand that the Model and Engines of the SEAME model refer to algorithms (which would possibly correspond to the Create stage of the UNESCO framework).&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We can identify areas for exploration</h3>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-expands-to-reach-over-2-million-students/">international expansion of Experience AI</a>, we have been working with partners from across the globe to bring AI literacy education to students in their settings. Part of this process has involved working with our partners to localise the resources, but also to provide training on the concepts covered in Experience AI. During localisation and training, our partners often have lots of queries about the lesson on bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, we decided to see if mapping taught us anything about this lesson in particular, and if there was any learning we could take from it. At close inspection, we found that the lesson covers two out of the three curricular goals for the Understand element of the ‘Ethics of AI’ category (Embodied ethics).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88920" style="width:695px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>Specifically, we felt the lesson:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Illustrates dilemmas around AI and identifies the main reasons behind ethical conflicts</li>



<li>Facilitates scenario-based understandings of ethical principles on AI and their personal implications</li>
</ul>



<p>What we felt isn’t covered in the lesson is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Guide the embodied reflection and internalisation of ethical principles on AI</li>
</ul>



<p>Exploring this further, the framework describes this curricular goal as:</p>



<p>“<em>Guide students to understand the implications of ethical principles on AI for their human rights, data privacy, safety, human agency, as well as for equity, inclusion, social justice and environmental sustainability. Guide students to develop embodied comprehension of ethical principles; and offer opportunities to reflect on personal attitudes that can help address ethical challenges (e.g. advocating for inclusive interfaces for AI tools, promoting inclusion in AI and reporting discriminatory biases found in AI tools).</em>”</p>



<p>We realised that this doesn’t mean that the lesson on bias is ineffective or incomplete, but it does help us to think more deeply about the learning objective for the lesson. This may be something we will look to address in future iterations of the foundations unit or even in the development of new resources. What we have identified is a process that we can follow, which will help us with our decision making in the next phases of resource development.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does this inform our next steps?</h2>



<p>As part of the analysis of the resources, we created a simple heatmap of how the Experience AI objectives relate to the UNESCO progression levels. As with the barcharts, the heatmap indicated that the majority of the objectives sit within the Understand level of progression, with fewer in Apply, and fewest in Create. As previously mentioned, this is to be expected with the resources being “foundational”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The heatmap has, however, helped us to identify some interesting points about our resources that warrant further thought. For example, under the ‘Human-centred mindset’ competency aspect, there are more objectives under Apply than there are Understand. For ‘AI system design’, architecture design is the least covered aspect of Apply.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88921" style="width:686px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>By identifying these areas for investigation, again it shows that we’re able to add the learnings from the UNESCO framework to help us make decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What next?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This mapping process has been a very useful exercise in many ways for those of us working on AI literacy at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The process of mapping the resources gave us an opportunity to have deep conversations about the learning objectives and question our own understanding of our resources. It was also very satisfying to see that the framework aligns well with our own researched-informed design principles, such as the SEAME model and avoiding anthropomorphisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mapping process has been a good starting point for us to understand UNESCO’s framework and we’re sure that it will act as a useful tool to help us make decisions around future enhancements to our foundational units and new free educational materials. We’re looking forward to applying what we’ve learnt to our future work!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As computing technologies continue to rapidly evolve in today’s digital world, computing education is becoming increasingly essential. <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/arto-hellas">Arto Hellas</a> and <a href="https://juholeinonen.com/">Juho Leinonen</a>, researchers at <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en">Aalto University</a> in Finland, are exploring how innovative teaching methods can equip students with the computing skills they need to stay ahead. In particular, they are looking at how generative AI tools can enhance university-level computing education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars">monthly seminar</a> in September, Arto and Juho presented their research on using AI tools to provide personalised learning experiences and automated feedback to help requests, as well as their findings on teaching students how to write effective prompts for generative AI systems. While their research focuses primarily on undergraduate students — given that they teach such students — many of their findings have potential relevance for primary and secondary (K-12) computing education.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Generative AI consists of algorithms that can generate new content, such as text, code, and images, based on the input received. Ever since large language models (LLMs) such as <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://copilot.cloud.microsoft/?auth=2">Copilot</a> became widely available, there has been a great deal of attention on how to use this technology in computing education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arto and Juho described generative AI as one of the fastest-moving topics they had ever worked on, and explained that they were trying to see past the hype and find meaningful uses of LLMs in their computing courses. They presented three studies in which they used generative AI tools with students in ways that aimed to improve the learning experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using generative AI tools to create personalised programming exercises</h2>



<p>An important strand of computing education research investigates how to engage students by personalising programming problems based on their interests. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3632620.3671103">The first study in Arto and Juho’s research </a>&nbsp;took place within an online programming course for adult students. It involved developing a tool that used GPT-4 (the latest version of ChatGPT available at that time) to generate exercises with personalised aspects. Students could select a theme (e.g. sports, music, video games), a topic (e.g. a specific word or name), and a difficulty level for each exercise.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-500x333.jpg" alt="A student in a computing classroom." class="wp-image-81587" style="width:646px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/10/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-08.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Arto, Juho, and their students evaluated the personalised exercises that were generated. Arto and Juho used a rubric to evaluate the quality of the exercises and found that they were clear and had the themes and topics that had been requested. Students’ feedback indicated that they found the personalised exercises engaging and useful, and preferred these over randomly generated exercises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arto and Juho also evaluated the personalisation and found that exercises were often only shallowly personalised, however. In shallow personalisations, the personalised content was added in only one sentence, whereas in deep personalisations, the personalised content was present throughout the whole problem statement. It should be noted that in the examples taken from the seminar below, the terms ‘shallow’ and ‘deep’ were not being used to make a judgement on the worthiness of the topic itself, but were rather describing whether the personalisation was somewhat tokenistic or more meaningful within the exercise.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="279" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-500x279.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88840" style="width:624px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-500x279.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-300x167.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-768x428.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-800x446.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-450x251.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3-900x502.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-3.png 1370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="283" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-500x283.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88841" style="width:670px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-500x283.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-300x170.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-768x435.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-800x453.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-450x255.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4-900x510.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-4.png 1366w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>In these examples from the study, the shallow personalisation contains only one sentence to contextualise the problem, while in the deep example the whole problem statement is personalised.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The findings suggest that this personalised approach may be particularly effective on large university courses, where instructors might struggle to give one-on-one attention to every student. The findings further suggest that generative AI tools can be used to personalise educational content and help ensure that students remain engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How might all this translate to K-12 settings? Learners in primary and secondary schools often have a wide range of prior knowledge, lived experiences, and abilities. Personalised programming tasks could help diverse groups of learners engage with computing, and give educators a deeper understanding of the themes and topics that are interesting for learners.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Responding to help requests using large language models</h2>



<p>Another key aspect of Alto and Juho’s work is exploring how LLMs can be used to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3568813.3600139">generate responses to students’ requests for help</a>. They conducted a study using an online platform containing programming exercises for students. Every time a student struggled with a particular exercise, they could submit a help request, which went into a queue for a teacher to review, comment on, and return to the student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study aimed to investigate whether an LLM could effectively respond to these help requests and reduce the teachers’ workloads. An important principle was that the LLM should guide the student towards the correct answer rather than provide it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study used GPT-3.5, which was the newest version at the time. The results found that the LLM was able to analyse and detect logical and syntactical errors in code, but concerningly, the responses from the LLM also addressed some non-existent problems! This is an example of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-equal-access-ai-education/">hallucination</a>, where the LLM outputs something false that does not reflect the real data that was inputted into it.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="279" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-500x279.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88842" style="width:652px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-500x279.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-300x167.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-768x429.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-1536x857.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-800x447.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-450x251.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5-900x502.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-5.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>An example of how an LLM was able to detect a logical error in code, but also hallucinated and provided an unhelpful, false response about a non-existent syntactical error.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The finding that LLMs often generated both helpful and unhelpful problem-solving strategies suggests that this is not a technology to rely on in the classroom just yet. Arto and Juho intend to track the effectiveness of LLMs as newer versions are released, and explained that GPT-4 seems to detect errors more accurately, but there is no systematic analysis of this yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In primary and secondary computing classes, young learners often face similar challenges to those encountered by university students — for example, the struggle to write error-free code and debug programs. LLMs seemingly have a lot of potential to support young learners in overcoming such challenges, while also being valuable educational tools for teachers without strong computing backgrounds. Instant feedback is critical for young learners who are still developing their computational thinking skills — LLMs can provide such feedback, and could be especially useful for teachers who may lack the resources to give individualised attention to every learner. Again though, further research into <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/error-message-explanations-large-language-models-teachers-views/">LLM-based feedback systems</a> is needed before they can be implemented en-masse in classroom settings in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching students how to prompt large language models</h2>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Finally, Arto and Juho presented <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626252.3630909">a study where they introduced the idea of ‘Prompt Problems’</a>: programming exercises where students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators using a tool called Promptly. In a Prompt Problem exercise, students are presented with a visual representation of a problem that illustrates how input values will be transformed to an output. Their task is to devise a prompt (input) that will guide an LLM to generate the code (output) required to solve the problem. Prompt-generated code is evaluated automatically by the Promptly tool, helping students to refine the prompt until it produces code that solves the problem.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="302" height="392" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-88843" style="width:332px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg 302w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/image-193x250.jpeg 193w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The workflow of a </em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630909"><em>Prompt Problem</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Feedback from students suggested that using Prompt Problems was a good way for them to gain experience of using new programming concepts and develop their computational thinking skills. However, students were frustrated that bugs in the code had to be fixed by amending the prompt — it was not possible to edit the code directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How these findings relate to K-12 computing education is still to be explored, but they indicate that Prompt Problems with text-based programming languages could be valuable exercises for older pupils with a solid grasp of foundational programming concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Balancing the use of AI tools with fostering a sense of community</strong></h2>



<p>At the end of the presentation, Arto and Juho summarised their work and hypothesised that as society develops more and more AI tools, computing classrooms may lose some of their community aspects. They posed a very important question for all attendees to consider: “How can we foster an active community of learners in the generative AI era?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our breakout groups and the subsequent whole-group discussion, we began to think about the role of community. Some points raised highlighted the importance of working together to accurately identify and define problems, and sharing ideas about which prompts would work best to accurately solve the problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI technology continues to evolve, its role in education will likely expand. There was general agreement in the question and answer session that keeping a sense of community at the heart of computing classrooms will be important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worldwide, the use of generative AI systems and related technologies is transforming our lives. From marketing and social media to education and industry, these technologies are being used everywhere, even if it isn’t obvious. Yet, despite the growing availability and use of generative AI tools, governments are still working out how and when to regulate such technologies to ensure they don’t cause unforeseen negative consequences. </p>



<p>How, then, do we equip our young people to deal with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/">opportunities and challenges that they are faced with from generative AI applications and associated systems</a>? Teaching them <strong>about</strong> AI technologies seems an important first step. But what should we teach, when, and how?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Researching AI curriculum design</strong></h2>



<p>The researchers at the Raspberry Pi Foundation have been looking at research that will help inform curriculum design and resource development to teach about AI in school. As part of this work, a number of research themes have been established, which we would like to explore with educators at a face-to-face symposium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These research themes include the SEAME model, a simple way to analyse learning experiences about AI technology, as well as anthropomorphisation and how this might influence the formation of mental models about AI products. These research themes have become the cornerstone of the Experience AI resources we’ve co-developed with Google DeepMind. We will be using these materials to exemplify how the research themes can be used in practice as we review the recently published UNESCO AI competencies.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we will also review how we can help teachers and learners move from a rule-based view of problem solving to a data-driven view, from computational thinking 1.0 to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/machine-learning-education-school-computational-thinking-2-0-research-seminar/">computational thinking 2.0</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A call for teacher input on the AI curriculum</strong></h2>



<p>Over ten years ago, teachers in England experienced a large-scale change in what they needed to teach in computing lessons when programming was more formally added to the curriculum. As we enter a similar period of change — this time to introduce teaching about AI technologies — we want to hear from teachers as we collectively start to rethink our subject and curricula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We think it is imperative that educators’ voices are heard as we reimagine computer science and add data-driven technologies into an already densely packed learning context.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="263" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-500x263.png" alt="A man on a blue background, with question marks over his head, surrounded by various objects and animals, such as apples, planets, mice, a dinosaur and a shark." class="wp-image-88749" style="width:673px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-500x263.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-300x158.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-768x403.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-1536x806.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-800x420.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13-900x473.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-13.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The value of learning about AI and ML</strong></h2>



<p>By engaging with AI and ML at a young age, creators gain a clearer understanding of the capabilities and limitations of these technologies, helping them to challenge misconceptions. This early exposure also builds foundational skills that are increasingly important in various fields, preparing creators for future educational and career opportunities. Additionally, as AI and ML become more integrated into educational standards, having a strong base in these concepts will make it easier for creators to grasp more advanced topics later on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s included in this collection</strong></h2>



<p>We’re excited to offer a range of AI and ML projects that feature both video tutorials and step-by-step written guides. The video tutorials are designed to guide creators through each activity at their own pace and are captioned to improve accessibility. The step-by-step written guides support creators who prefer learning through reading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The projects are crafted to be flexible and engaging. The main part of each project can be completed in just a few minutes, leaving lots of time for customisation and exploration. This setup allows for short, enjoyable sessions that can easily be incorporated into Code Club activities.</p>



<p>The collection is organised into two distinct paths, each offering a unique approach to learning about AI and ML:</p>



<p><a href="http://rpf.io/mlws"><strong>Machine learning with Scratch</strong></a> introduces foundational concepts of ML through creative and interactive projects. Creators will train models to recognise patterns and make predictions, and explore how these models can be improved with additional data.</p>



<p><a href="http://rpf.io/ai-toolkit"><strong>The AI Toolkit</strong></a> introduces various AI applications and technologies through hands-on projects using different platforms and tools. Creators will work with voice recognition, facial recognition, and other AI technologies, gaining a broad understanding of how AI can be applied in different contexts.</p>



<p>Inclusivity is a key aspect of this collection. The projects cater to various skill levels and are offered alongside an unplugged activity, ensuring that everyone can participate, regardless of available resources. Creators will also have the opportunity to stretch themselves — they can explore advanced technologies like Adobe Firefly and practical tools for managing Ollama and Stable Diffusion models on Raspberry Pi computers.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://rpf.io/tam"><strong>Teach a </strong><strong>m</strong><strong>achine</strong></a>, creators train a computer to recognise different objects such as fingers or food items. This project introduces classification in a straightforward way using the <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine</a> platform, making the concept easy to grasp.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://rpf.io/avt"><strong>Apple vs </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>omato</strong></a> also uses Teachable Machine, but this time creators are challenged to train a model to differentiate between apples and tomatoes. Initially, the model exhibits bias due to limited data, prompting discussions on the importance of data diversity and ethical AI practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://rpf.io/dinodecisions"><strong>Dinosaur </strong><strong>d</strong><strong>ecision </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>ree</strong></a> is an unplugged activity where creators use a paper-based branching chart to classify different types of dinosaurs. This hands-on project introduces the concept of decision-making structures, where each branch of the chart represents a choice or question leading to a different outcome. By constructing their own decision tree, creators gain a tactile understanding of how these models are used in ML to analyse data and make predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These AI projects are designed to support young people to get hands-on with AI technologies in Code Clubs and other non-formal learning environments. Creators can also enter one of their projects into <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org">Coolest Projects</a> by taking a short video showing their project and any code used to make it. Their creation will then be showcased in the online gallery for people all over the world to see.</p>
