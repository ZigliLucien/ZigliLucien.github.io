Protected and raised on Earth by her foster family, the Danvers, Kara grew up in the shadow of her foster sister, Alex (Chyler Leigh), and learned to conceal the phenomenal powers she shares with her famous cousin in order to keep her identity a secret. Years later at 24, Kara lives in National City assisting media mogul and fierce taskmaster Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart). She works alongside her friend and IT technician Winn Schott (Jeremy Jordan) and famous photographer James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks), who Grant just hired away from the Daily Planet to serve as her new art director. However, Karaâs days of keeping her talents a secret are over when Hank Henshaw (David Harewood), head of a super-secret agency where her sister also works, enlists her to help them protect the citizens of National City from sinister threats. After 12 years of keeping her powers a secret on Earth, Kara decides to finally embrace her superhuman abilities and be the hero she was always meant to be. The episode was written by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg and Ali Adler and directed by Glen Winter (#101).]]></description>
