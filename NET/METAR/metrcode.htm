      Meteorological Actual Report (METAR) Data</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>METAR Data is quite simple to decode. The following text explains basically 
how to decode METAR code. There are obviously many exceptions, especially US 
METAR Code. To view a more comprehensive guide to decoding METAR data<A 
href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oso/oso1/oso12/metar.htm"> click here to go to the 
<I>NWS</I> METAR &amp; TAF Page.</A> 
<P>Below is an example METAR code 
<P>041750Z EGBB 25032G53KT 210V280 0800 R15/0800 R33/P1500 +TSRA SCT009 BKN015CB 
05/M01 Q0975 BECMG 9999 NSW SCT015 <BR>
<P>METAR code is made up of several sections. The following text describes what 
each each section is, and the code used. 
<UL>
  <P>
  <LI><I>Section 1.</I> 041750Z
  <P>This section is the date and time. In the example the date is the 4th and 
  the time 1750Z. Z means GMT 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 2.</I> EGBB
  <P>This section is the ICAO Airport Identifier. EGBB is Birmingham, UK. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 3.</I> 25032G53KT
  <P>The first 3 digits is the wind direction in degrees. So in this example, 
  250 is 250 degrees. <BR>If 000 is shown it means wind Calm. If VRB is shown it 
  means wind variable. <BR>The next 2 digits (32) is the wind speed. <BR>The 
  following figures (G53) is the gust speed (if applicable) <BR>The units are 
  then shown. KT is knots and MPS is metres per second. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 4.</I> 210V280
  <P>This is the direction in which the wind is varying. In this example, wind 
  is varying between 210 degrees and 280 degrees. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 5.</I> 0800
  <P>This is the visibility in metres. <BR>9999 = 10km or more, 3000 = 3000m, 
  0800 = 800m, 0000 = Less than 50m. <BR>Some places use statute miles in which 
  case this visibility would be given with SM on the end, eg. 5SM (5 statute 
  miles). 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 6.</I> R15/0800 R33/P1500
  <P>This is the Runway Visual Range (RVR) and is usually only given if the 
  visibility is 2000m or less. <BR>R15 is the runway number. R15 = Runway 15, 
  R27R = Runway 27 Right etc. <BR>/0800 is the visibility in metres. /0800 = 
  800m. <BR>If the visibility is prefixed with P, this means more than (P1500 = 
  More than 1500m). <BR>If the visibility is followed by D it means decreasing, 
  N means unchanged and U is increasing (this is not used in the UK) 
  <BR>Sometimes RVR's will be quoted as varying between 2 visibilities (a 
  maximum and minimum in the 30 minute period). This is shown like this... 
  0800V1200 (varying between 800m and 1200m) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 7.</I> +TSRA
  <P>This is the current weather. <A 
  href="http://www.ukweather.freeserve.co.uk/metarpg.htm#pwx">Click here</A> to 
  go to the current weather codes. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 8.</I> SCT009 BKN015CB.
  <P>These are the cloud layers and heights. <BR>The first three letters are the 
  cloud cover of the layer. CLR or SKC or NSC means sky clear, FEW means few 
  cloud (1/8 or 2/8), SCT means Scattered cloud (3/8 or 4/8), BKN means Broken 
  cloud (5/8, 6/8 or 7/8), OVC means Overcast cloud (8/8), VV means Sky Obscured 
  (followed by the vertical visibility in feet /// = not measured, 001 = 100ft, 
  002 = 200ft etc.). <BR>The three figures are the height of the cloud in 
  hundreds of feet. 000 = Below 100ft, 001 = 100ft, 002 = 200ft etc. <BR>If CB 
  follows the cloud layer and height, it means the cloud is Cumulonimbus cloud. 
  If TCU follows it means Towering Cumulus 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 9.</I> 05/M01
  <P>This is the Temperature and Dew Point in celcius. <BR>The temperature is 
  the first 2 figures. In the example, 05 means 5C. <BR>The last two figures 
  (after the /) is the Dew Point. <BR>Minus temperatures are prefixed by an M. 
  So M01 = - 1C 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 10.</I> Q0975
  <P>This is the Sea level pressure (QNH) in millibars. <BR>Q0975 = 975mb, Q1030 
  would be 1030mb. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Section 11.</I> BECMG 9999 NSW.
  <P>This is the trend forecast for the next two hours. <BR>BECMG = Becoming, 
  TEMPO = Temporarily, NOSIG = No Significant Change. <BR>This is followed by 
  trend (also in METAR code following the rules above). This example would read 
  "Becoming 10km or more, No Significant Weather (NSW), Scattered cloud at 
  1500ft". <BR>Sometimes the trend is prefixed by the letters FM (From) or TIL 
  (Unitl) and a time.</P></LI></UL>
<P>Hopefully now (with some practice) you will be able to decode a METAR. 
<P>The following example shows about the most complex METAR your likely to see. 
<P>010000Z EHAM VRB02KT 0000 R19R/0050V0250D R01R/0050N R27/0200D R06/0000U +SN 
+BLSN FZFG VV001 M01/M01 Q0999 BECMG FM0100 03015G25KT 5000 SHSN BKN005CB 
<P>This would read as "Amsterdam (EHAM) at 0000GMT on the 1st. <BR>Wind variable 
2 knots, <BR>Visibility less than 50m, <BR>RVR Runway 19 Right, Varying between 
50m and 250m, Decreasing; RVR Runway 01 Right, 50m, No change; RVR Runway 27, 
200m, Decreasing; RVR Runway 06, less than 50m, Increasing. <BR>Heavy Snow, 
Heavy Blowing Snow, Freezing Fog. <BR>Sky Obscured, vertical visibility 100ft. 
<BR>Temperature -1, Dew Point -1 <BR>QNH 999 millibars. <BR>Becoming, From 0100, 
Wind 030 degrees 15 knots maximum 25 knots, Visibility 5km, Snow Showers, Broken 
Cumulonimbus at 500ft."

<P>TAF's are quite similar to METAR in most of its code. 
<P>Here is an example TAF. 
<P>071600 EGBB 080018 20012KT 9999 SCT035 PROB30 TEMPO 0008 BKN010 TEMPO 0813 
18015G25KT RA BKN012 BECMG 1114 21020G40KT TEMPO 1318 -RA BKN015 
<P>They don't really come much more complicated than this really. Lets take it 
bit by bit 
<UL>
  <LI><B>071600</B> This is the issue date and time. 071600= 07th of the month 
  at 1600 GMT 
  <LI><B>EGBB</B> This is the station code. EGBB= Birminghm, UK. 
  <LI><B>080018</B> This is the date and time the TAF is valid between. 080018= 
  The 8th, between 00:00 and 18:00. 
  <LI><B>20012KT</B> This is the expected wind speed. 20012KT= wind 200 degrees, 
  12kts 
  <LI><B>9999</B> This is the expected visibility. 9999= 10km or more 
  <LI><B>SCT035</B> This is the expected cloud. SCT035= Scattered at 3500ft. 
  <LI><B>PROB30</B> This means the probability of the following occuring is 30%. 

  <LI><B>TEMPO 0008 BKN010</B> This means; Temporarily between 00:00 and 08:00 
  the cloud will be Broken at 1000ft. (the probabilty of this is 30% as 
  mentioned above) 
  <LI><B>TEMPO 0813 18015G25KT RA BKN012</B> This means; Temporarily between 
  08:00 and 13:00, the wind will be 180 degrees at 15 gusting 25kts, MODERATE 
  RAIN, cloud broken at 1200ft. 
  <LI><B>BECMG 1114 21020G40KT</B> This means; Becoming from 11:00 to 14:00, 
  wind 210 degrees, 20 gusting 40kts. 
  <LI><B>TEMPO 1318 -RA BKN015</B> This means; Temporarily between 13:00 and 
  18:00, LIGHT RAIN, broken cloud at 1500ft.</LI></UL>
